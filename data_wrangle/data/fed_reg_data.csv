practice.’’ 21 U.S.C. 802(21). Likewise, 
the CSA conditions the granting of a 
practitioner’s application on his/her 
possession of authority to dispense 
controlled substances under state law. 
See 21 U.S.C. 823(f) (‘‘The Attorney 
General shall register practitioners . . . 
to dispense . . . controlled substances 
. . . if the applicant is authorized to 
dispense . . . controlled substances 
under the laws of the State in which he 
practices.’’). Of further note, the CSA 
defines the term ‘‘dispense’’ as meaning 
‘‘to deliver a controlled substance to an 
. by, or pursuant to the 
ultimate user .
lawful order of, a practitioner.’’ Id. 
§ 802(10) (emphasis added). 

Thus, the Agency has repeatedly held 

.

that the possession of authority to 
dispense controlled substances under 
the laws of the State in which a 
practitioner engages in professional 
practice is a fundamental condition for 
obtaining and maintaining a 
practitioner’s registration. See, e.g., 
James L. Hooper, 76 FR 71371 (2011), 
pet. for rev. denied, 481 Fed Appx. 826 
(4th Cir. 2012). And because a 
practitioner’s authority under the CSA 
is based on his/her authority to dispense 
controlled substances under the laws of 
the State in which he practices, the 
Agency has further held that ‘‘to the 
extent a practitioner is not authorized 
under state law to dispense certain 
categories or schedules of controlled 
substances, he can no longer lawfully 
dispense them under federal law.’’ 
Kenneth Harold Bull, 78 FR 62666, 
62672 (2013). 

In Bull, a case in which the 

practitioner’s state board had prohibited 
him from prescribing narcotics, the 
Agency explained that ‘‘where a state 
board takes such action, at a minimum, 
a practitioner’s CSA registration must be 
limited to authorize the dispensing of 
only those controlled substances, which 
he can lawfully dispense under state 
law.’’ Id. at 62672. Here, the Florida 
Department of Health has suspended 
Respondent’s authority to prescribe any 
medications listed in schedules II, III, or 
IV of the Florida schedules of controlled 
substances, and under Florida law, 
Respondent is limited to prescribing 
only those controlled substances in 
schedule V.4 Accordingly, I will order 

4 Have reviewed the schedules of controlled 

substances under Florida law, I conclude that they 
are coterminous with those of the CSA with the 
exception of buprenorphine, which under Florida 
law, is a schedule V controlled substance. While 
buprenorphine was formerly a schedule V drug 
under the CSA, in 2002, the drug was placed in 
schedule III following the Department of Health and 
Human Services’ reevaluation of the drug’s ‘‘abuse 
potential and dependence profile in light of 
numerous scientific studies and years of human 
experience with [the] drug.’’ Schedules of

that Respondent’s registration shall be 
restricted to prohibit him from 
dispensing controlled substances in 
schedules II through IV and to authorize 
only the prescribing of schedule V 
controlled substances. 

The conduct giving rise to the 
criminal charges for racketeering 
activity, unlawful distribution of 
controlled prescription drugs, and 
manslaughter related to drug overdose 
deaths could serve as the basis for a 
request for total revocation based on 
public interest grounds (or, in the event 
of a conviction, based upon a conviction 
of a felony related to controlled 
substances). 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(2) and (4). 
The Order to Show Cause before me is 
based solely upon Respondent’s lack of 
state authority to handle certain 
controlled substances. This Order is 
constrained by the basis set forth in the 
Order to Show Cause, and I will only 
consider Respondent’s alleged criminal 
conduct if and when he is served with 
an Order to Show Cause why his 
registration should not be revoked in 
total based on public interest grounds, 
and he is given the opportunity to 
address that allegation. 
Order 

Pursuant to the authority vested in me 

by 21 U.S.C. 824(a), as well as 28 CFR 
0.100(b), I order that DEA Certificate of 
Registration BB3166053, issued to Ibem 
R. Borges, M.D., be, and it hereby is, 
restricted to prohibit the dispensing of 
controlled substance in schedules II 
through IV and to authorize only the 
prescribing of controlled substances in 
schedule V of the Controlled Substances 
Act (21 CFR 1308.15). This Order is 
effective immediately. 

Controlled Substances: Rescheduling of 
Buprenorphine From Schedule V to Schedule III, 67 
FR 62354 (2002) (final rule). Thus, this Agency has 
determined that the drug ‘‘has a potential for abuse 
less than the drugs or other substances in schedules 
I and II,’’ that it ‘‘has a currently accepted medical 
use in treatment in the United States,’’ and most 
importantly, that ‘‘[a]buse of the drug . . . may lead 
to moderate or low physical dependence or high 
psychological dependence.’’ 21 U.S.C. 812(b)(3); see 
also 67 FR at 62367. 

Notably, Florida has adopted the same criteria for 

placing a drug in its schedule III as the CSA uses, 
see Fla. Stat. 893.03(3), and the State has 
determined that Respondent’s ‘‘continued, 
unrestricted practice of medicine poses an 
immediate serious danger to the public health, 
safety or welfare,’’ and concluded, inter alia, that 
he cannot safely prescribe controlled substances in 
schedule III. GX 8, at 20; see also id. at 28. I 
therefore hold that notwithstanding that 
buprenorphine remains a schedule V drug under 
Florida law and that the scope of his federal 
authority derives from his authority under state 
law, the placement of the drug in schedule III of the 
CSA precludes him from lawfully prescribing the 
drug under his DEA registration.

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13729  of  May  18,  2016 

A  Comprehensive  Approach  to  Atrocity  Prevention  and  Re-
sponse 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  As  articulated  in  Presidential  Study  Directive-10  (PSD– 
10),  preventing  mass  atrocities  and  genocide  is  a  core  national  security 
interest  and  a  core  moral  responsibility  of  the  United  States.  Noting  that 
governmental  engagement  on  mass  atrocities  and  genocide  too  often  arrives 
too  late,  when  opportunities  for  prevention  or  low-cost,  low-risk  action 
have  been  missed,  PSD–10  directed  the  establishment  of  an  interagency 
Atrocities  Prevention  Board  (Board),  with  the  primary  purpose  of  coordi-
nating a whole-of-government approach to prevent mass atrocities and geno-
cide. PSD–10 also directed an interagency study to develop and recommend 
the  membership,  mandate,  structure,  operational  protocols,  authorities,  and 
support necessary for the Board to coordinate and develop atrocity prevention 
and  response  policy.  This  order  continues  in  place  the  Board  established 
in  2012  as  I  directed  in  PSD–10,  sets  out  the  support  to  be  afforded  by 
executive  departments,  agencies,  and  offices,  and  updates  and  memorializes 
the  terms  on  which  the  Board  will  continue  to  operate  in  the  service  of 
its important mission. 
Sec.  2.  Definition.  For  purposes  of  this  order,  the  term  ‘‘mass  atrocities’’ 
or  ‘‘atrocities,’’  neither  of  which  is  defined  under  international  law,  refers 
to  large  scale  and  deliberate  attacks  on  civilians,  and  includes  acts  falling 
within  the  definition  ‘‘genocide’’  as  defined  in  international  law  and  under 
U.S. domestic statute. 
Sec.  3.  Responsibilities.  The  Board  shall  seek  to  ensure  that  mass  atrocities 
and  the  risk  thereof  are  effectively  considered  and  appropriately  addressed 
by the U.S. Government, and shall coordinate the development and execution 
of  policies  and  tools  to  enhance  our  capacity  to  prevent  and  respond  to 
mass atrocities. 

(a)  In  order  to  ensure  that  emerging  mass  atrocity  risks  and  mass  atrocity 
situations  are  considered  and  addressed,  the  Board  shall  monitor  develop-
ments around the world that heighten the risk of mass atrocities, and analyze 
and  closely  review  specific  mass  atrocity  threats  or  situations  of  heightened 
concern. 

(b)  The  Board  shall  also  identify  any  gaps  related  to  the  prevention  of 
and  response  to  mass  atrocities  in  the  current  policies  and  ongoing  inter-
agency  processes  concerning  particular  regions  or  countries  and  shall  make 
recommendations  to  strengthen  policies,  programs,  resources,  and  tools  re-
lated  to  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response  to  relevant  executive  depart-
ments  and  agencies  (agencies),  including  through  the  Board’s  function  as 
an  interagency  policy  committee,  as  detailed  in  section  4  of  this  order. 
In  these  efforts,  the  Board  shall  focus  in  particular  on  ways  for  the  U.S. 
Government to develop, strengthen, and enhance its capabilities to: 

(i) monitor, receive early warning of, and coordinate responses to potential 
mass atrocities; 
(ii)  deter  and  isolate  perpetrators  of  mass  atrocities  through  all  available 
and appropriate authorities;

(iii) promote accountability of and deny impunity for perpetrators of mass 
atrocities,  including  by  denying  safe  haven  for  perpetrators  found  in  the 
United States; 
(iv)  engage  allies  and  partners,  including  the  United  Nations  and  other 
multilateral and regional institutions, to build capacity and mobilize action 
for preventing and responding to mass atrocities; 
(v) deploy civilian personnel with expertise in conflict prevention, civilian

sponse  basis,  to  assist  in  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response  efforts; 
(vi) increase capacity for our diplomats, armed services, development pro-
fessionals,  and  other  actors  to  engage  in  mass  atrocity  prevention  and 
response activities; 
(vii)  develop  and  implement  tailored  foreign  assistance  programs  as  well 
as  doctrine  for  our  armed  services  to  address  and  mitigate  the  risks  of 
mass atrocities; 
(viii)  ensure  intelligence  collection,  analysis,  and  sharing  of  information, 
as appropriate, relating to mass atrocity threats and situations; and 
(ix)  address  any  other  issue  regarding  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  re-
sponse that the Board determines is appropriate. 

Sec.  4.  Structure  and  Protocols  of  the  Atrocities  Prevention  Board.  The 
Board  shall  continue  to  operate  and  will  have  the  following  structure  and 
protocols:

the President (Chair). 

(b)  The  Chair  shall  convene  the  Board  on  a  monthly  basis  to  perform

and address emerging mass atrocity threats or situations. 

(c)  The  Deputies  Committee  of  the  National  Security  Council  (Deputies) 
shall  meet  at  least  twice  per  year,  and  the  Principals  Committee  of  the

to review and direct the work of the Board. 

(d) The Board shall be composed of individuals at the Assistant Secretary- 
level or higher who shall be designated by the leadership of their respective 
departments  or  agencies.  Within  60  days  of  a  vacancy  on  the  Board,  the 
relevant  department  or  agency  or  office  head  shall  designate  a  replacement 
representative  and  notify  the  National  Security  Advisor.  In  addition  to  the

(e)  The  Chair  shall  report,  through  the  National  Security  Advisor,  to  the 
President  by  April  30  each  year  on  the  work  of  the  U.S.  Government  in 
mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response,  including  the  work  of  the  Board. 
(f)  The  Chair  shall  prepare  written  updates  for  the  public,  on  an  annual

(g)  Consistent  with  the  objectives  set  out  in  this  order  and  in  accordance 
with  applicable  law,  the  Board  shall  conduct  outreach,  including  regular 
consultations,  with  representatives  of  nongovernmental  organizations  with 
expertise  in  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response  and  other  appropriate 
parties.  Such  outreach  shall  be  for  the  purpose  of  assisting  the  Board  with 
its  work  on  considering  and  addressing  emerging  mass  atrocity  threats  or 
situations  and  on  developing  new  or  improved  policies  and  tools,  as  well 
as  for  the  purpose  of  providing  transparency  on  the  work  of  the  Board.

Sec.  5.  Enhancing  Capabilities  and  Tools.  Agencies  shall  take  the  following 
actions  in  support  of  the  United  States  Government’s  policy  of  working 
to prevent and respond to mass atrocities: 

(a) Agencies, in coordination with the Board, shall ensure that mass atrocity

dressed  in  their  strategic  planning  and  budget  processes,  including  Depart-
ment  Quadrennial  Reviews,  Mission  Resource  Requests,  State  Department 
Integrated  Country  Strategies,  U.S.  Agency  for  International  Development 
(USAID)  Joint  Strategic  Plans,  State  Department  Bureau  Strategic  Resource 
Plans,  and  related  strategic  planning  and  budget  processes  and  documents.

skills)  effectively  for  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response,  and  shall  de-
velop  mechanisms  for  enhanced  partnerships  with  non-U.S.  Government 
actors  that  could  provide  surge  capacity,  such  as  the  United  Nations  and 
other multilateral and regional organizations, foreign governments, and non-
governmental organizations.

(e)  The  IC  shall  continue  to  monitor  developments  worldwide  and,  as 
changing conditions warrant, prepare an IC-coordinated assessment updating 
IC  judgments  in  its  National  Intelligence  Estimate  on  the  global  risk  of 
mass  atrocities  and  genocide  at  regular  intervals  to  inform  the  work  of 
the Board. 

(f) Recognizing mass atrocity prevention as a core national security interest 
of  the  United  States,  the  IC  shall  allocate  resources  so  as  to  permit  a 
collection surge for countries where the Board determines, and the Deputies 
concur,  that  there  are  ongoing  or  acute  risks  of  mass  atrocities  that  merit 
increased  attention,  in  accordance  with  the  National  Intelligence  Priority 
Framework and available resources. 

(g) The IC shall work with partner governments to encourage the collection 
and  analysis  of  mass  atrocity-related  intelligence  and  the  sharing  of  this 
intelligence  with  the  U.S.  Government  and  its  partners  in  mass  atrocity 
prevention and response. 

(h)  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  and  the  Department 
of  Justice,  in  coordination  with  the  Department  of  State,  shall  continue 
to develop proposals for legislative, regulatory, or administrative amendments 
or  changes  that  would  permit  the  more  effective  use  and  enforcement  of 
immigration  and  other  laws  to  deny  impunity  to  perpetrators  of  mass  atroc-
ities  and  that  would  enhance  our  ability  to  prosecute  such  perpetrators 
subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  and  remove  those  who  are 
not citizens. 

(i)  The  Department  of  Defense  (DOD)  shall  continue  to  develop  joint 
doctrine  and  training  that  support  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response 
operations  and  shall  address  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response  as  part 
of its general planning guidance to combatant commands and services. 

(j)  The  Department  of  State,  the  Department  of  the  Treasury,  DHS,  the 
U.S.  Mission  to  the  United  Nations  (USUN),  and  other  agencies  as  appro-
priate, shall coordinate with bilateral and multilateral partners on the deploy-
ment  of  mass  atrocity  prevention  and  response  tools,  including  isolating 
and deterring perpetrators of mass atrocities through all available authorities 
(including administrative actions, visa authorities, and capacity-building sup-
port), as appropriate. 

(k)  The  Department  of  State,  in  coordination  with  USUN,  DOD,  and  other 
agencies  as  appropriate,  shall  work  bilaterally,  multilaterally,  and  with  re-
gionally  based  organizations  to  enhance  effectiveness  in  the  fields  of  early 
warning,  analysis,  prevention,  response,  and  accountability,  and  shall  work 
with  international  partners  to  build  or  encourage  building  the  capacity  of 
our allies and partners to prevent and respond to mass atrocities. 
Sec.  6.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Members  of  the  Board  shall  serve  without 
any additional compensation for their work on the Board.

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department,  agency,  or 
the  head  thereof,  or  the  status  of  that  department  or  agency  within  the 
Federal Government; or 
(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administra-
tive, or legislative proposals. 
(c)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law,  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

Notice  of  June  10,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Actions  and  Policies  of  Certain  Members  of  the  Government 
of  Belarus  and  Other  Persons  to  Undermine  Belarus’s  Demo-
cratic  Processes  or  Institutions 

On  June  16,  2006,  by  Executive  Order  13405,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Pow-
ers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  con-
stituted  by  the  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government 
of  Belarus  and  other  persons  to  undermine  Belarus’s  democratic  processes 
or  institutions,  manifested  in  the  fundamentally  undemocratic  March  2006 
elections,  to  commit  human  rights  abuses  related  to  political  repression, 
including detentions and disappearances, and to engage in public corruption, 
including  by  diverting  or  misusing  Belarusian  public  assets  or  by  misusing 
public authority. 

The  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government  of  Belarus 
and  other  persons  continue  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  June  16,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9423  of  April  12,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Belmont-Paul  Women’s  Equality  Na-
tional  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  Sewall-Belmont  House  (House),  located  at  144  Constitution  Avenue, 
Northeast,  in  Washington,  D.C.—a  few  steps  from  the  U.S.  Capitol—has 
been  home  to  the  National  Woman’s  Party  (NWP)  since  1929.  From  this 
House,  the  NWP’s  founder  Alice  Paul  wrote  new  language  in  1943  for 
the  Equal  Rights  Amendment,  which  became  known  as  the  ‘‘Alice  Paul 
Amendment,’’  and  led  the  fight  for  its  passage  in  the  Congress.  From  here, 
throughout  the  20th  century,  Paul  and  the  NWP  drafted  more  than  600 
pieces  of  legislation  in  support  of  equal  rights  and  advocated  tirelessly 
for  women’s  political,  social,  and  economic  equality  not  just  in  the  United 
States but also internationally. 
While  the  House’s  role  in  women’s  history  makes  it  a  nationally  significant 
resource, the building itself has an interesting past. Robert Sewall constructed 
the  House  on  Jenkins  Hill,  known  today  as  Capitol  Hill,  around  1800. 
Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin used the House during the Jefferson 
Administration,  and  the  House  was  the  site  of  the  only  resistance  to  the 
British invasion of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812. In retaliation, 
the  British  set  fire  to  the  House,  but  by  1820,  Sewall  had  rebuilt  it.  The 
House  remained  in  the  Sewall  family  until  1922,  when  it  was  acquired 
by Vermont Senator Porter Dale. 
The  NWP  purchased  the  House  in  1929  to  serve  as  its  headquarters.  The 
NWP  named  it  the  ‘‘Alva  Belmont  House’’  in  honor  of  its  former  president 
and  major  benefactor  who  had  helped  purchase  the  NWP’s  previous  head-
quarters.  A  prominent  suffragist  herself,  Belmont  said  of  the  new  head-
quarters,  ‘‘may  it  stand  for  years  and  years  to  come,  telling  of  the  work 
that  the  women  of  the  United  States  have  accomplished;  the  example  we 
have  given  foreign  nations;  and  our  determination  that  they  shall  be—as 
ourselves—free  citizens,  recognized  as  the  equals  of  men.’’  What  is  now 
called  the  Sewall-Belmont  House  became  the  staging  ground  for  the  NWP’s 
advocacy  for  an  equal  rights  amendment  and  other  significant  domestic 
and international action for women’s equality. 
Alice  Paul,  the  women’s  suffrage  and  equal  rights  leader  closely  associated 
with  the  Sewall-Belmont  House,  led  the  NWP  from  its  headquarters  at  the 
House  from  1929  to  1972.  A  Quaker  and  well  educated,  before  her  work 
in the United States, Paul had been inspired by the women’s suffrage move-
ment  in  Britain  in  the  early  20th  century.  During  her  years  there  from 
1907  to  1910,  she  joined  with  Emmeline  Pankhurst,  her  daughters,  and 
other  suffragettes  to  secure  the  vote  for  British  women.  Paul’s  participation 
in  meetings,  demonstrations,  and  depositions  to  Parliament  led  to  multiple 
arrests, hunger strikes, and force-feedings. 
Paul  brought  home  her  focus  on  women’s  suffrage  when  she  returned  to 
the United States in 1910. After earning a Ph.D. in economics at the Univer-
sity  of  Pennsylvania  in  1912,  she  devoted  herself  to  the  American  suffrage 
movement.  She  feared  that  the  movement  was  waning  at  the  national  level 
because efforts had shifted to State suffrage. Paul believed that the movement

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  73 / Friday,  April  15,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

needed  to  concentrate  on  the  passage  of  a  Federal  suffrage  amendment 
to the United States Constitution. 

Paul became a member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association 
(NAWSA)  and  by  1912  served  as  the  chair  of  its  Congressional  Committee 
in  Washington,  D.C.  In  1913,  she  and  Lucy  Burns  created  a  larger  organiza-
tion,  the  Congressional  Union  of  Woman  Suffrage,  which  soon  disagreed 
with  NAWSA  over  tactics.  The  Congressional  Union  split  from  NAWSA 
in  1914  and  evolved  into  the  NWP  through  steps  taken  in  1916  and  1917. 

Paul  was  the  most  prominent  figure  in  the  final  phase  of  the  battle  for 
the  Nineteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution,  ratified  in 
1920, granting women the right to vote. As part of her strategy, she adopted 
the  philosophy  to  ‘‘hold  the  party  in  power  responsible’’  from  her  work 
on  women’s  suffrage  in  Britain.  The  NWP  withheld  its  support  from  the 
existing  political  parties  until  women  gained  the  right  to  vote,  and  ‘‘pun-
ished’’  those  parties  in  power  that  did  not  support  suffrage.  In  1913,  the 
day  before  Woodrow  Wilson’s  first  inauguration,  Paul  organized  a  women’s 
suffrage  parade  of  more  than  5,000  participants  from  every  State  in  the 
Union. Through a series of dramatic nonviolent protests, the NWP demanded 
that  President  Wilson  and  the  Congress  address  women’s  issues.  The  NWP 
organized ‘‘Silent Sentinels’’ to stand outside the White House holding ban-
ners  inscribed  with  incendiary  phrases  directed  toward  President  Wilson. 
The  colorful,  spirited  suffrage  marches,  the  suffrage  songs,  the  violence 
the  women  faced  as  they  were  physically  attacked  and  had  their  banners 
torn  from  their  hands,  the  daily  pickets  and  arrests  at  the  White  House, 
the  recurring  jail  time,  the  hunger  strikes  which  resulted  in  force-feedings 
and  brutal  prison  conditions,  the  national  speaking  tours,  and  newspaper 
headlines all created enormous public support for suffrage. 

Through  most  of  the  last  century,  the  NWP  remained  a  leading  advocate 
of  women’s  political,  social,  and  economic  equality.  Following  ratification 
of  the  Nineteenth  Amendment,  the  NWP,  under  the  leadership  of  Alice 
Paul,  turned  its  attention  towards  the  larger  issue  of  complete  equality 
of  men  and  women  under  the  law.  Paul  reorganized  the  NWP  in  1922 
to  focus  on  eliminating  all  discrimination  against  women.  In  1923,  at  the 
75th  anniversary  of  the  Seneca  Falls  Convention,  the  first  women’s  rights 
convention,  Paul  proposed  an  equal  rights  amendment  to  the  Constitution, 
which  became  known  as  the  ‘‘Lucretia  Mott  Amendment,’’  and  launched 
the  campaign  to  win  full  equality  for  women.  In  1943,  Alice  Paul  rewrote 
the amendment, which then became known as the ‘‘Alice Paul Amendment.’’ 
What  we  now  refer  to  as  the  ‘‘Equal  Rights  Amendment’’  was  introduced 
in  every  session  of  Congress  from  1923  until  it  finally  passed  in  1972, 
though  it  still  has  not  been  ratified  by  the  required  majority:  three-fourths 
of the States. 

Throughout  the  1920s  and  1930s,  the  NWP  drafted  more  than  600  pieces 
of  legislation  in  support  of  equal  rights  for  women  on  the  State  and  local 
levels,  including  bills  covering  divorce  and  custody  rights,  jury  service, 
property  rights,  ability  to  enter  into  contracts,  and  the  retention  of  one’s 
maiden  name  after  marriage.  It  launched  two  major  ‘‘Women  for  Congress’’ 
campaigns  in  1924  and  1926  and  lobbied  for  the  appointment  of  women 
to  high  Federal  positions.  The  NWP  also  worked  for  Federal  and  State 
‘‘blanket  bills’’  to  ensure  women  equal  rights  and  helped  change  Federal 
laws  to  equalize  nationality  and  citizenship  laws  for  women.  The  NWP 
fought successfully for the repeal of a statute that prohibited Federal employ-
ees  from  working  for  the  Federal  Government  if  their  spouses  also  were 
Federal  employees.  The  NWP  helped  eliminate  many  of  the  sex  discrimina-
tion  clauses  in  the  ‘‘codes  of  fair  competition’’  established  under  the  New 
Deal’s  National  Recovery  Administration,  and  assisted  in  the  adoption  of 
the  Fair  Labor  Standards  Act  of  1938.  Paul  and  the  NWP  also  played  a 
role  in  getting  language  protecting  women  included  in  the  Civil  Rights 
Act of 1964.

Alice  Paul  and  the  NWP  did  not  limit  their  fight  for  women’s  rights  to 
domestic  arenas  but  also  became  active  in  international  feminism  as  early 
as the 1920s. Among other actions, in 1938 Paul formed the World Woman’s 
Party, which served as the NWP’s international organization. It first assisted 
Jewish  women  fleeing  the  Holocaust  and  then  became  the  NWP’s  office 
for  promoting  equal  rights  for  women  around  the  world.  The  NWP  helped 
both  Puerto  Rican  and  Cuban  women  in  seeking  the  vote,  and  in  1945 
advocated successfully for the incorporation of language on women’s equality 
in  the  United  Nations  Charter  and  for  the  establishment  of  a  permanent 
United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. 
The  political  strategies  and  tactics  of  Alice  Paul  and  the  NWP  became 
a  blueprint  for  civil  rights  organizations  and  activities  throughout  the  20th 
century. In 1997, the NWP ceased to be a lobbying organization and became 
a  non-profit,  educational  organization.  Today,  the  House  tells  the  story  of 
a century of courageous activism by American women. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  the  President’s  discretion, 
to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric 
structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  in  all  cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  in  1974,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  designated  the  Sewall- 
Belmont  House  a  National  Historic  Landmark  for  its  association  with  Alice 
Paul,  the  NWP,  and  the  fight  for  equal  rights,  and  later  the  same  year 
the Congress enacted legislation creating the Sewall-Belmont House National 
Historic Site, an affiliated area of the National Park System; 
WHEREAS, the National Park Service completed a study in November 2014, 
which  recommended  that  the  Sewall-Belmont  House  become  a  unit  of  the 
National Park System and operate through cooperative management between 
the National Park Service and the NWP; 
WHEREAS, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be admin-
istered  by  the  National  Park  Service,  the  NWP  has  donated  to  the  Federal 
Government  fee  title  to  the  Sewall-Belmont  House  and  the  approximately 
0.34 acres of land on which it is located; 
WHEREAS,  the  National  Park  Service  and  the  NWP  agree  that  the  NWP 
should continue to own and manage its collection, which includes an exten-
sive  library  and  archival  and  museum  holdings  relating  to  the  women’s 
movement, and the NWP has indicated its intention to enter into appropriate 
arrangements with the National Park Service that would further the preserva-
tion  of  the  permanent  collection  at  the  Sewall-Belmont  House  and  provide 
for  cooperative  interpretation  and  management  activities  with  the  National 
Park Service; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  the  Sewall- 
Belmont House and the historic objects associated with it; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Belmont-Paul  Women’s  Equality  National 
Monument  (monument)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects, 
reserve as a part thereof all lands and interests in lands owned or controlled 
by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accom-
panying  map,  which  is  attached  to  and  forms  a  part  of  this  proclamation. 
The  reserved  Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately 
0.34 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined 
to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper  care  and  management  of 
the objects to be protected.

with  the  purposes  and  provisions  of  this  proclamation.  The  Secretary  shall 
prepare a management plan, with full public involvement and in coordination 
with the NWP, within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. The manage-
ment  plan  shall  ensure  that  the  monument  fulfills  the  following  purposes 
for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future  generations:  (1)  to  preserve  and  protect 
the  objects  of  historic  interest  associated  with  the  monument,  and  (2)  to 
interpret  the  monument’s  objects,  resources,  and  values  related  to  the  wom-
en’s  rights  movement.  The  management  plan  shall,  among  other  things, 
set forth the desired relationship of the monument to other related resources, 
programs,  and  organizations,  both  within  and  outside  the  National  Park 
System. 

The  National  Park  Service  is  directed  to  use  applicable  authorities  to  seek 
to  enter  into  agreements  with  others,  and  the  NWP  in  particular,  to  address 
common interests and promote management efficiencies, including provision 
of  visitor  services,  interpretation  and  education,  establishment  and  care  of 
museum collections, and preservation of historic objects. 

Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation. 

Warning  is  hereby  given  to  all  unauthorized  persons  not  to  appropriate, 
injure,  destroy,  or  remove  any  feature  of  this  monument  and  not  to  locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twelfth  day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Presidential Documents

Notice  of  May  17,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Burma 

On  May  20,  1997,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13047,  certifying 
to  the  Congress  under  section  570(b)  of  the  Foreign  Operations,  Export 
Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1997 (Public Law 104– 
208),  that  the  Government  of  Burma  had  committed  large-scale  repression 
of  the  democratic  opposition  in  Burma  after  September  30,  1996,  thereby 
invoking  the  prohibition  on  new  investment  in  Burma  by  United  States 
persons  contained  in  that  section.  The  President  also  declared  a  national 
emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act, 
50  U.S.C.  1701–1706,  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by the actions and policies of the Government of Burma. 

The  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  Burma  continue  to  pose 
an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign 
policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared 
on  May  20,  1997,  and  the  measures  adopted  to  deal  with  that  emergency 
in  Executive  Orders  13047  of  May  20,  1997;  13310  of  July  28,  2003;  13448 
of  October  18,  2007;  13464  of  April  30,  2008;  13619  of  July  11,  2012; 
and  13651  of  August  6,  2013,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  May  20, 
2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national 
emergency  with  respect  to  Burma  declared  in  Executive  Order  13047.  This 
notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to  the 
Congress.

Executive  Order  13742  of  October  7,  2016 

Termination  of  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the  Actions  and 
Policies  of  the  Government  of  Burma 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.),  the  National  Emergencies 
Act  (50  U.S.C.  1601  et  seq.)  (NEA),  section  570  of  the  Foreign  Operations, 
Export  Financing,  and  Related  Programs  Appropriations  Act,  1997  (Public 
Law  104–208),  the  Burmese  Freedom  and  Democracy  Act  of  2003  (Public 
Law 108–61), the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE (Junta’s Anti-Democratic 
Efforts)  Act  of  2008  (Public  Law  110–286)  (the  ‘‘JADE  Act’’),  section  212(f) 
of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1952,  as  amended  (8  U.S.C. 
1182(f)) (INA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code. 
I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  find  that 
the  situation  that  gave  rise  to  the  declaration  of  a  national  emergency  in 
Executive  Order  13047  of  May  20,  1997,  with  respect  to  the  actions  and 
policies  of  the  Government  of  Burma,  in  particular  a  deepening  pattern 
of  severe  repression  by  the  State  Law  and  Order  Restoration  Council,  the 
then-governing  regime  in  Burma,  as  modified  in  scope  by  Executive  Order 
13448  of  October  18,  2007,  and  Executive  Order  13619  of  July  11,  2012, 
has  been  significantly  altered  by  Burma’s  substantial  advances  to  promote 
democracy,  including  historic  elections  in  November  2015  that  resulted  in 
the  former  opposition  party,  the  National  League  for  Democracy,  winning 
a majority of seats in the national parliament and the formation of a democrat-
ically  elected,  civilian-led  government;  the  release  of  many  political  pris-
oners;  and  greater  enjoyment  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms, 
including  freedom  of  expression  and  freedom  of  association  and  peaceful 
assembly.  Accordingly,  I  hereby  terminate  the  national  emergency  declared 
in  Executive  Order  13047,  and  revoke  that  order,  Executive  Order  13310 
of  July  28,  2003,  Executive  Order  13448,  Executive  Order  13464  of  April 
30,  2008,  Executive  Order  13619,  and  Executive  Order  13651  of  August 
6, 2013, and further order: 
Section  1.  Pursuant  to  section  202(a)  of  the  NEA  (50  U.S.C.  1622(a)),  termi-
nation  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13047,  as 
modified  in  scope  by  Executive  Order  13448,  and  Executive  Order  13619, 
shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending not finally concluded 
or determined as of the effective date of this order, any action or proceeding 
based  on  any  act  committed  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  or 
any  rights  or  duties  that  matured  or  penalties  that  were  incurred  prior 
to the effective date of this order. 
Sec.  2.  Pursuant  to  section  5(i)  of  the  JADE  Act,  I  hereby  determine  and 
certify  that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  of  the  United  States  to  waive, 
and  hereby  waive,  the  sanctions  described  in  section  5(b)  of  the  JADE 
Act. 
Sec.  3.  In  light  of  the  revocation  of  Executive  Order  13310,  Executive  Order 
13448,  and  Executive  Order  13464,  the  suspension  of  entry  as  immigrants

Notice  of  November  9,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Burundi 

On  November  22,  2015,  by  Executive  Order  13712,  I  declared  a  national 
emergency to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  situation 
in  Burundi,  which  has  been  marked  by  the  killing  of  and  violence  against 
civilians,  unrest,  the  incitement  of  imminent  violence,  and  significant  polit-
ical  repression,  and  which  threatens  the  peace,  security,  and  stability  of 
Burundi. 
The  situation  in  Burundi  continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States. 
For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  November  22,  2015, 
to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  November  22,  2016. 
Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies 
Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13712. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9394  of  February  12,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Castle  Mountains  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  Castle  Mountains  area,  bounded  on  three  sides  by  Mojave  National 
Preserve  (Preserve),  possesses  outstanding  natural,  cultural,  and  historical 
values  representing  some  of  the  finest  characteristics  of  the  eastern  Mojave 
Desert.  It  connects  water  flow  and  wildlife  corridors  of  the  Preserve,  and 
completes  the  boundary  of  the  Preserve  along  the  California-Nevada  border. 
Beneath  the  shadow  of  Hart  Peak  lie  rich  cultural  and  historic  resources, 
including  Native  American  archeological  sites  and  the  historic  gold  mining 
ghost  town  of  Hart.  Exposed  geologic  features  contribute  to  the  area’s  out-
standing scenery. 
Shaped  by  millions  of  years  of  geologic  forces,  the  rugged  Castle  Mountains 
are  emblematic  of  the  Mojave  landscape.  The  Castle  Mountains  rise  from 
the broad sweep of the Lanfair Valley to a height of over 5,000 feet, presenting 
a picturesque skyline visible from many locations within the Preserve, while 
also  affording  spectacular  views  of  the  Preserve  and  beyond.  Hart  Peak 
is  the  prominent  feature  in  the  Castle  Mountains  skyline  at  5,543  feet. 
Views  from  Hart  Peak  encompass  vast  wilderness  and  distinctive  peaks, 
including Spirit Mountain in Nevada, a sacred site to many Native American 
tribes. The remoteness of the Castle Mountains area offers visitors the chance 
to  experience  the  solitude  of  the  desert  and  its  increasingly  rare  natural 
soundscapes and dark night skies. 
The  Castle  Mountains  area  provides  a  critical  linkage  for  plants,  animals, 
and  water  between  two  mountain  ranges  within  the  Preserve,  the  New 
York  Mountains  to  the  northwest  and  the  Piute  Mountains  to  the  southeast. 
The  area’s  high  quality  desert  habitat  includes  some  of  the  finest  Joshua 
tree  forest  in  the  Mojave  Desert,  as  well  as  pinyon  pine  and  juniper  forest 
at  the  upper  elevations.  The  area’s  native  desert  grassland  is  a  hotspot 
of  botanical  diversity.  The  unique  plant  assemblage  includes  28  species 
of  native  grasses,  about  half  of  which  are  rare,  including  burrograss  and 
false buffalograss. 
Protection  of  this  relatively  intact  and  undisturbed  habitat  is  important 
not just to the long-term survival of many plant species but also to significant 
wildlife  populations.  A  herd  of  desert  bighorn  sheep  lives  on  the  steep, 
rocky  slopes  of  the  Castle  Mountains.  They  and  other  wildlife  traverse 
the area between the Piute Mountains and the New York Mountains. Numer-
ous bat species live in rock crevices and mine remnants in the area. Wildlife 
species  of  special  concern  include  the  Townsend’s  big-eared  bat,  California 
leaf-nosed  bat,  Swainson’s  hawk,  golden  eagle,  desert  tortoise,  Bendire’s 
thrasher, and gray vireo. 
With  its  habitat  linkages,  wildlife  corridors,  and  intact  ecosystems,  the  area 
offers  exceptional  opportunities  to  study  plant  and  animal  movement  and 
connections  between  diverse  natural  systems,  especially  in  the  context  of 
climate  change.  Ongoing  studies  of  desert  bighorn  sheep  and  other  plant 
and animal species have shown the priority of this area for scientific research. 
A  recent  study  using  network  models  of  bighorn  sheep  genetic  and  demo-
graphic  connectivity  as  tools  for  landscape-scale  conservation  found  the 
Castle  Mountains  habitat  to  be  one  of  the  most  important  in  the  Mojave

Desert. Botanists are finding new and rare plant populations, and significant 
new information regarding the range of species such as Mexican panicgrass, 
in the Castle Mountains area. 
The  Castle  Mountains  area  is  the  only  remaining  portion  of  the  226-square 
mile  Lanfair  Valley  watershed  that  is  not  part  of  the  Preserve.  Underlying 
much  of  the  Lanfair  Valley,  including  the  Castle  Mountains  area,  is  a  large 
groundwater  aquifer  of  critical  importance  to  the  desert  ecosystem.  With 
its  primary  recharge  zone  in  the  New  York  Mountains,  this  aquifer  feeds 
Piute  Spring,  located  in  the  Preserve  just  south  of  the  Castle  Mountains 
area.  Piute  Spring  is  the  only  perennial  stream  and  riparian  corridor  in 
the Preserve, and attracts numerous flora and fauna. 
As  a  rare  desert  water  source,  Piute  Spring  attracted  Native  American  habi-
tation  for  thousands  of  years,  followed  by  Euro-American  exploration  and 
settlement.  Drawn  to  this  reliable  source  of  potable  water,  in  1867  the 
U.S. Army established Fort Piute (listed on the National Register of Historic 
Places)  adjacent  to  the  spring  to  provide  protection  to  travelers  on  the 
Old  Spanish  Trail  (known  locally  as  the  Mojave  Road)  that  crossed  the 
Mojave Desert from the Colorado River to San Bernardino, California. Mainte-
nance  of  the  groundwater  resources  and  flow  to  Piute  Spring  is  essential 
to  the  historical  and  scientific  value  of  both  the  area  and  the  Preserve. 
The Castle Mountains area also contains other cultural resources that reflect 
a  long  history  of  prehistoric  and  historic  human  use.  Prehistoric  rock  art 
and archeological sites are found throughout the area. The rock art indicates 
sites  of  significant  cultural  import  to  both  the  Fort  Mojave  and  Chemehuevi 
Tribes, marking routes through the Castle Mountains likely traveled by both 
tribes. The Castle Mountains area links places to the south, like Piute Spring, 
to areas north, such as an obsidian collection site. Western expansion brought 
ranching,  mining,  and  the  railroad  to  the  area.  Some  of  the  best-preserved 
segments  of  a  wagon  road  that  linked  the  Arizona  Territory  (Hardyville, 
now  Bullhead  City,  Arizona)  to  settlements  in  southern  California  can  be 
found  in  the  Castle  Mountains  area.  Ranchers  grazed  cattle  in  the  area. 
By  1894,  the  Rock  Springs  Land  and  Cattle  Company  had  consolidated 
its  holdings  in  the  eastern  Mojave  Desert.  Much  of  their  historic  ranch 
lies  within  the  Preserve,  and  features  of  this  and  other  grazing  enterprises 
of  the  era  can  still  be  seen  in  the  Castle  Mountains  area.  In  1907,  brothers 
Bert  and  Clark  Hitt  found  rich  gold  ore,  staking  claims  that  became  the 
Oro  Belle  and  Big  Chief  Mines.  With  James  Hart,  they  founded  the  town 
of  Hart  at  the  base  of  Hart  Peak.  Between  1908  and  1910,  the  town  of 
Hart  underwent  a  rapid  boom  and  bust,  and  by  1920,  Hart  had  become 
a ghost town. Throughout this period of western expansion, railroads served 
the ranchers, miners, Hart residents, and others in the eastern Mojave Desert. 
Part  of  the  former  23-mile  Barnwell  and  Searchlight  Railway,  later  incor-
porated into the California Eastern Railway, ran through the Castle Mountains 
area. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  the  historic 
and scientific objects in the Castle Mountains area; 
WHEREAS, the protection of the Castle Mountains area’s outstanding objects 
of  historic  and  scientific  interest  would  also  contribute  to  the  protection 
of the resources and values of the Preserve; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54,

Notice  of  May  9,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Central  African  Republic 

On May 12, 2014, by Executive Order 13667, I declared a national emergency 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security 
and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  situation  in 
and  in  relation  to  the  Central  African  Republic,  which  has  been  marked 
by a breakdown of law and order, intersectarian tension, widespread violence 
and  atrocities,  and  the  pervasive,  often  forced  recruitment  and  use  of  child 
soldiers,  and  which  threatens  the  peace,  security,  or  stability  of  the  Central 
African Republic and neighboring states. 
The  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  the  Central  African  Republic  continues 
to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and 
foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  May  12,  2014,  to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  May  12,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Presidential  Determination  No.  2016–09  of  August  4,  2016 

Continuation  of  U.S.  Drug  Interdiction  Assistance  to  the  Gov-
ernment  of  Colombia 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State  [and]  the  Secretary  of  Defense 

Pursuant  to  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  1012  of  the  National 
Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  1995,  as  amended  (22  U.S.C.

of  aircraft  reasonably  suspected  to  be  primarily  engaged  in  illicit  drug  traf-
ficking  in  that  country’s  airspace  is  necessary,  because  of  the  extraordinary 
threat posed by illicit drug trafficking to the national security of that country; 
and  (2)  Colombia  has  appropriate  procedures  in  place  to  protect  against 
innocent  loss  of  life  in  the  air  and  on  the  ground  in  connection  with 
such  interdiction,  which  shall  at  a  minimum  include  effective  means  to 
identify  and  warn  an  aircraft  before  the  use  of  force  is  directed  against 
the aircraft. 
The  Secretary  of  State  is  authorized  and  directed  to  publish  this  determina-
tion in the Federal Register and to notify the Congress of this determination.

Notice  of  October  18,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Sig-
nificant  Narcotics  Traffickers  Centered  in  Colombia 

On  October  21,  1995,  by  Executive  Order  12978,  the  President  declared 
a national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers centered 
in  Colombia  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States 
constituted  by  the  actions  of  significant  narcotics  traffickers  centered  in 
Colombia  and  the  extreme  level  of  violence,  corruption,  and  harm  such 
actions cause in the United States and abroad. 
The actions of significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue 
to  threaten  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United 
States  and  to  cause  an  extreme  level  of  violence,  corruption,  and  harm 
in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  in  Executive  Order  12978  of  October  21,  1995,  and  the  measures 
adopted  pursuant  thereto  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in 
effect beyond October 21, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for 
1 year the national emergency with respect to significant narcotics traffickers 
centered in Colombia declared in Executive Order 12978. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Executive  Order  13734  of  August  3,  2016 

Amending  Executive  Order  13675  To  Expand  Membership  on 
the  President’s  Advisory  Council  on  Doing  Business  in  Africa 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  promote  broad- 
based  economic  growth  and  job  creation  in  the  United  States  and  Africa 
by  encouraging  U.S.  companies  to  trade  with  and  invest  in  Africa,  it  is 
hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Recognizing  the  tremendous  potential  of  expanding  the 
U.S.-Africa  commercial  relationship,  the  United  States  in  2014  launched 
the  Trade  Africa  Initiative,  a  partnership  between  the  United  States  and 
Sub-Saharan  Africa,  and  created  a  U.S.  Strategy  Toward  Sub-Saharan  Africa 
outlining a comprehensive U.S. policy for the region, among other activities. 
Ensuring  that  such  initiatives  and  activities  reflect  the  priorities  of,  and 
benefit  from  the  support  of,  the  private  sector  is  critical  to  their  success. 
For  that  reason,  in  Executive  Order  13675  of  August  5,  2014,  I  directed 
the  Secretary  of  Commerce  to  establish  the  President’s  Advisory  Council 
on  Doing  Business  in  Africa  (Council).  Since  its  establishment  in  November 
2014,  the  Council  has  been  actively  engaged  in  advising  on  strengthening 
commercial  engagement  between  the  United  States  and  Africa  and  has  pro-
vided  numerous  recommendations  on  a  broad  range  of  issues.  In  light  of 
the  numerous  U.S.  Government  initiatives  and  activities  to  promote  expan-
sion of the commercial relationship, the breadth of U.S. private sector engage-
ment in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the range of issues on which future advice 
may  be  requested,  broader  representation  of  the  diversity  of  private  sector 
viewpoints,  experiences,  and  knowledge  on  the  Council  is  warranted.  Thus 
I am increasing the membership of the Council. 
Sec.  2.  Amendment  to  Executive  Order  13675.  Executive  Order  13675  of 
August  5,  2014,  is  amended  in  section  3(a)  by  striking  ‘‘shall  consist  of 
not  more  than  15  private  sector  corporate  members’’  and  inserting  in  lieu 
thereof ‘‘shall consist of not more than 26 private sector corporate members’’. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

Memorandum  of  January  28,  2016 

White  House  Cancer  Moonshot  Task  Force 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

Cancer  is  a  leading  cause  of  death,  and  cancer  incidence  is  expected  to 
increase  worldwide  in  the  coming  decades.  But  today,  cancer  research  is 
on  the  cusp  of  major  breakthroughs.  It  is  of  critical  national  importance 
that  we  accelerate  progress  towards  prevention,  treatment,  and  a  cure— 
to double the rate of progress in the fight against cancer—and put ourselves 
on  a  path  to  achieve  in  just  5  years  research  and  treatment  gains  that 
otherwise  might  take  a  decade  or  more.  To  that  end,  I  hereby  direct  the 
following: 
Section  1.  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot  Task  Force.  There  is  established, 
within  the  Office  of  the  Vice  President,  a  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot 
Task  Force  (Task  Force),  which  will  focus  on  making  the  most  of  Federal 
investments,  targeted  incentives,  private  sector  efforts  from  industry  and 
philanthropy,  patient  engagement  initiatives,  and  other  mechanisms  to  sup-

Title  3— 

The  President 

Executive  Order  13748  of  November  16,  2016 

Establishing  a  Community  Solutions  Council 

83619 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Place  is  a  strong  determinant  of  opportunity  and  well- 
being.  Research  shows  that  the  neighborhood  in  which  a  child  grows  up 
impacts  his  or  her  odds  of  going  to  college,  enjoying  good  health,  and 
obtaining  a  lifetime  of  economic  opportunities.  Even  after  73  consecutive 
months  of  total  job  growth  since  2009,  communities  of  persistent  poverty 
remain  and  for  far  too  many,  the  odds  are  stacked  against  opportunity 
and  achieving  the  American  dream.  In  addition,  between  now  and  2050, 
growing  our  economy,  expected  population  growth,  climate  change,  and 
demographic  shifts  will  require  major  new  investments  in  physical,  social, 
and technological infrastructure. 
Specific challenges in communities—including crime, access to care, opportu-
nities  to  pursue  quality  education,  lack  of  housing  options,  unemployment, 
and deteriorating infrastructure—can be met by leveraging Federal assistance 
and  resources.  While  the  Federal  Government  provides  rural,  suburban, 
urban,  and  tribal  communities  with  significant  investments  in  aid  annually, 
coordinating  these  investments,  as  appropriate,  across  agencies  based  on 
locally  led  visions  can  more  effectively  reach  communities  of  greatest  need 
to  maximize  impact.  In  recent  years,  the  Federal  Government  has  deepened 
its engagement with communities, recognizing the critical role of these part-
nerships in enabling Americans to live healthier and more prosperous lives. 
Since  2015,  the  Community  Solutions  Task  Force,  comprising  executive 
departments, offices, and agencies (agencies) across the Federal Government, 
has served as the primary interagency coordinator of agency work to engage 
with communities to deliver improved outcomes. This order builds on recent 
work  to  facilitate  inter-agency  and  community-level  collaboration  to  meet 
the  unique  needs  of  communities  in  a  way  that  reflects  these  communities’ 
local  assets,  economies,  geography,  size,  history,  strengths,  talent  networks, 
and visions for the future. 
Sec.  2.  Principles.  Our  effort  to  modernize  the  Federal  Government’s  work 
with communities is rooted in the following principles: 

(a)  A  community-driven,  locally  led  vision  and  long-term  plan  for  clear 

outcomes should guide individual projects. 

(b)  The  Federal  Government  should  coordinate  its  efforts  at  the  Federal, 
regional,  State,  local,  tribal,  and  community  level,  and  with  cross-sector 
partners, to offer a more seamless process for communities to access needed 
support and ensure equitable investments. 

(c)  The  Federal  Government  should  help  communities  identify,  develop, 
and  share  local  solutions,  rely  on  data  to  determine  what  does  and  does 
not work, and harness technology and modern collaboration and engagement 
methods  to  help  share  these  solutions  and  help  communities  meet  their 
local goals. 
Sec. 3. Community Solutions Council. 

(a)  Establishment.  There  is  hereby  established  a  Council  for  Community 
Solutions (Council), led by two Co-Chairs. One Co-Chair will be an Assistant 
to  the  President  or  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget, 
as  designated  by  the  President.  The  second  Co-Chair  will  be  rotated  every

Memorandum  of  March  29,  2016 

Mental  Health  and  Substance  Use  Disorder  Parity  Task  Force 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

My Administration has made behavioral health a priority and taken a number 
of  steps  to  improve  the  prevention,  early  intervention,  and  treatment  of 
mental  health  and  substance  use  disorders.  These  actions  are  especially 
important  in  light  of  the  prescription  drug  abuse  and  heroin  epidemic  as 
well  as  the  suicide  and  substance  use-related  fatalities  that  have  reversed 
increases  in  longevity  in  certain  populations.  One  important  response  has 
been  the  expansion  and  implementation  of  mental  health  and  substance 
use  disorder  parity  protections  to  ensure  that  coverage  for  these  benefits 
is  comparable  to  coverage  for  medical  and  surgical  care.  The  Affordable 
Care  Act  builds  on  the  Paul  Wellstone  and  Pete  Domenici  Mental  Health 
Parity  and  Addiction  Equity  Act  to  expand  mental  health  and  substance 
use disorder benefits and Federal parity protections for more than 60 million 
Americans.  To  realize  the  promise  of  coverage  expansion  and  parity  protec-
tions in helping individuals with mental health and substance use disorders, 
executive  departments  and  agencies  need  to  work  together  to  ensure  that 
Americans are benefiting from the Federal parity protections the law intends. 
To that end, I hereby direct the following: 
Section  1.  Mental  Health  and  Substance  Use  Disorder  Parity  Task  Force. 
There  is  established  an  interagency  Mental  Health  and  Substance  Use  Dis-
order  Parity  Task  Force  (Task  Force),  which  will  identify  and  promote 
best  practices  for  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies),  as  well 
as  State  agencies,  to  better  ensure  compliance  with  and  implementation 
of  requirements  related  to  mental  health  and  substance  use  disorder  parity, 
and  determine  areas  that  would  benefit  from  further  guidance.  The  Director 
of  the  Domestic  Policy  Council  shall  serve  as  Chair  of  the  Task  Force. 
(a)  Membership  of  the  Task  Force.  In  addition  to  the  Director  of  the 
Domestic  Policy  Council,  the  Task  Force  shall  consist  of  the  heads  of  the 
following agencies and offices, or their designees: 

(i) the Department of the Treasury; 
(ii) the Department of Defense; 
(iii) the Department of Justice; 
(iv) the Department of Labor; 
(v) the Department of Health and Human Services; 
(vi) the Department of Veterans Affairs; 
(vii) the Office of Personnel Management; 
(viii) the Office of National Drug Control Policy; and 
(ix) such other agencies or offices as the President may designate. 

At the request of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting 
exclusively  of  Task  Force  members  or  their  designees  under  this  section, 
as appropriate. 

(b)  Administration  of  the  Task  Force.  The  Department  of  Health  and 
Human  Services  shall  provide  funding  and  administrative  support  for  the 
Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. 
Sec.  2.  Mission  and  Functions  of  the  Task  Force.  The  Task  Force  shall 
coordinate across agencies to:

Memorandum  of  December  22,  2016 

Supporting  New  American  Service  Members,  Veterans,  and 
Their  Families 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

My  Administration  has  maintained  a  steadfast  commitment  to  honor  and 
serve  the  brave  men  and  women  who  have  served  this  country.  Like  all 
service members and veterans, foreign-born residents and naturalized citizens 
serving  in  the  United  States  Armed  Forces  are  shining  examples  of  the 
American  dream.  These  brave  new  Americans  have  taken  the  extraordinary 
step  of  answering  the  call  to  duty,  to  support  and  defend  our  country. 
Some  have  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice  for  our  country  before  becoming 
American citizens. 
New  American  service  members  are  undoubtedly  a  critical  element  of  our 
national  security.  They  risk  their  lives  all  over  the  world  in  the  name 
of the United States, securing shipping lanes, protecting bases and embassies, 
providing  medical  assistance,  and  conducting  humanitarian  missions.  Tens 
of  thousands  of  lawful  permanent  residents  and  naturalized  U.S.  citizens 
currently  serve  in  our  Armed  Forces.  Many  more  are  veterans  who  have 
served previously in the Armed Forces. Additionally, many U.S.-born service 
members have immediate family members who were born abroad. 
Over  the  past  decade,  the  Departments  of  Defense,  Veterans  Affairs,  and 
Homeland  Security  have  strengthened  partnerships  to  provide  services  and 
opportunities  to  service  members,  veterans,  and  their  families  interacting 
with  the  U.S.  immigration  system.  Indeed,  since  2001,  more  than  110,000 
service  members  have  been  naturalized  and  many  were  assisted  in  the 
process  through  partnerships  such  as  the  ‘‘Naturalization  at  Basic  Training 
Initiative,’’  which  gives  non-citizen  enlistees  the  opportunity  to  naturalize 
during  basic  training.  Despite  these  efforts,  service  members,  veterans,  and 
their  families  still  face  barriers  to  accessing  immigration  benefits  and  other 
assistance for which they may be eligible. 
In  light  of  the  sacrifices  that  all  of  these  individuals  make  and  have  made 
for  our  country,  it  is  critical  that  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agen-
cies)  enhance  collaboration  and  streamline  processes  to  ensure  that  they 
receive  the  services  and  benefits  they  need  and  have  earned.  Therefore, 
by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  to  address  the  issues  facing 
new American service members, veterans, and their families, I hereby direct 
as follows: 
Section  1.  Interagency  Working  Group  to  Support  New  American  Service 
Members, Veterans, and their Families. There is established a Working Group 
to  Support  New  American  Service  Members,  Veterans,  and  their  Families 
(Working Group) to coordinate records, benefits, and immigration and citizen-
ship  services  for  these  service  members,  veterans,  and  their  families.  The 
Working  Group  shall  convene  its  first  meeting  within  10  days  of  the  date 
of this memorandum. 

(a) The Working Group shall consist of representatives from: 
(i) the Department of State; 
(ii) the Department of Defense; 
(iii) the Department of Justice;

plan shall be supplemented by a more detailed plan, to be published within 
120  days  of  the  date  of  this  memorandum  that  discusses  the  steps  to  be 
taken  in  greater  detail.  The  Working  Group  shall  also  report  periodically 
on its accomplishments and ongoing initiatives. 
Sec.  3.  Outreach.  Consistent  with  the  objectives  of  this  memorandum  and 
applicable  law,  the  Working  Group  shall  seek  the  views  of  representatives

tions;  State,  tribal,  and  local  government  agencies;  elected  officials;  and 
other interested persons to inform the Working Group’s plans. 
Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) The heads of agencies shall assist and provide 
information  to  the  Working  Group,  consistent  with  applicable  law,  as  may 
be  necessary  to  carry  out  the  functions  of  the  Working  Group.  Each  agency 
and  office  shall  bear  its  own  expense  for  carrying  out  activities  related 
to the Working Group. 

(b) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise 
affect the authority granted by law to an executive department or an agency, 
or  the  head  thereof,  or  the  status  of  that  department  or  agency  within 
the Federal Government. 

(c)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable 

law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

78697 

Executive  Order  13746  of  November  3,  2016 

Advancing  the  Goals  of  the  Power  Africa  Initiative  to  Ex-
pand  Access  to  Electricity  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  Through 
the  Establishment  of  the  President’s  Power  Africa  Working 
Group 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  partner,  consult, 
and coordinate with African governments, bilateral and multilateral partners, 
the  private  sector,  and  civil  society  to  expand  access  to  electricity  and 
increase  electricity  generation  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  in  both  urban  and 
rural  areas.  Through  the  Power  Africa  initiative  (Power  Africa),  we  aim 
to double access to power in Sub-Saharan Africa by adding 30,000 megawatts 
(MW)  of  capacity  and  60  million  new  household  and  business  connections 
by  2030,  and  in  so  doing,  leapfrog  to  cleaner  forms  of  energy  and  foster 
inclusive economic growth and opportunity across Sub-Saharan Africa. 
On June 30, 2013, my Administration launched Power Africa, a new initiative 
to  double  access  to  power  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  more  than  two- 
thirds  of  the  population  is  without  electricity,  and  more  than  85  percent 
of  those  living  in  rural  areas  lack  access  to  electricity.  In  its  initial  phase, 
Power  Africa  aimed  to  add  more  than  10,000  MW  of  cleaner,  more  efficient 
electricity  generation  capacity  and  to  increase  electricity  access  by  at  least 
20  million  new  households  and  commercial  entities  with  on-grid,  mini- 
grid, and off-grid solutions. Power Africa builds on Africa’s enormous power 
potential, including extensive clean geothermal, hydro, wind and solar energy 
resources,  as  well  as  vast  oil  and  gas  reserves.  Power  Africa  works  with 
countries to develop resources responsibly, build out power generation, trans-
mission,  and  distribution,  and  expand  the  reach  of  mini-grid  and  off-grid 
solutions.  Power  Africa  brings  to  bear  a  wide  range  of  tools  from  across 
the Federal Government and more than 130 public and private sector partners 
to support investment in Africa’s energy sector. Power Africa provides coordi-
nated  support  to  help  African  partners  expand  their  power  networks  and 
access  to  electricity,  including  through  policy  and  regulatory  best  practices, 
institutional  capacity  building,  pre-feasibility  support,  grants,  long-term  fi-
nancing,  insurance,  guarantees,  credit  enhancements,  and  technical  assist-
ance. 
On August 5, 2014, during the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, my Administra-
tion  affirmed  that  Power  Africa  is  intended  to  reach  across  Sub-Saharan 
Africa, and tripled Power Africa’s goals. Power Africa is now working toward 
adding 30,000 MW of new, cleaner electricity generation capacity and increas-
ing  electricity  access  by  at  least  60  million  new  connections.  On  January 
28,  2016,  my  Administration,  in  coordination  with  Power  Africa  partners, 
launched  the  Power  Africa  Roadmap,  which  lays  out  a  concrete  plan  for 
Power Africa to meet its ambitious goals by 2030. 
The  Electrify  Africa  Act  of  2015,  enacted  on  February  8,  2016  (Public  Law 
114–121)  (the  ‘‘Act’’),  calls  for  the  development  of  a  strategy  to  add  at 
least  20,000  MW  of  electrical  power  and  promote  first-time  access  to  power 
and  power  services  for  at  least  50  million  people  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa 
by  2020  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas—an  effort  that  directly  supports 
and  complements  Power  Africa’s  goals.  This  order  furthers  the  purposes 
of the Act and the work that Power Africa has been undertaking.

(g)  Identify  best  practices  for  Participating  Agencies  to  coordinate  their 
engagement with development partners, including bilateral donors, develop-
ment  finance  institutions,  and  multilateral  development  banks  on  energy 
access  issues,  to  ensure  that  Power  Africa’s  tools  are  deployed  in  a  way 
that  is  complementary  to  and  leverages  the  impact  of  United  States  Govern-
ment resources. 

(h)  Meet  with  private  sector  partners,  as  appropriate,  to  review  Power 
Africa projects and activities, and to solicit input regarding technical, policy, 
financial  or  political,  obstacles  that  partners  are  encountering  in  the  energy 
sector across Sub-Saharan Africa. 

(i)  Meet  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  development  partners,  as  appro-
priate, to coordinate country-specific and regional energy access policy agen-
das,  coordinate  deployment  of  financial  resources  and  technical  expertise 
to  identify  and  accelerate  Power  Africa  projects  and  activities,  and  review 
project pipelines. 

(j)  Monitor  and  periodically  evaluate  Power  Africa  projects  and  activities 
to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  United  States  Government  assistance  and 
other  development  finance  tools  in  achieving  Power  Africa’s  electricity  gen-
eration  and  access  goals,  and  to  share  lessons  learned.  These  evaluations 
may recommend reforms to facilitate support for future projects and activities, 
and to increase the Working Group’s effectiveness. 
Sec.  5.  Partnering  with  African  Private  Sector  Companies.  I  hereby  direct 
Participating  Agencies  to  facilitate  as  appropriate,  to  the  maximum  extent 
possible  under  the  law,  the  participation  of  local  and  regional  companies 
in  power,  renewable  energy,  and  climate  change  projects  in  low-income 
countries in Africa, including through the use of financing and risk insurance, 
where appropriate. 
Sec.  6.  Reporting.  The  Administrator  of  USAID,  in  coordination  with  the 
Participating  Agencies,  shall  lead  in  the  development  of  a  report,  to  be 
transmitted  to  the  Congress  pursuant  to  section  7  of  the  Act  and  the  Presi-
dential  Memorandum  of  August  3,  2016,  ‘‘Delegation  of  Authority  Pursuant 
to  Section  4  and  Section  7  of  the  Electrify  Africa  Act  of  2015,’’  on  progress 
made  toward  achieving  the  comprehensive,  integrated,  multiyear  strategy 
that was transmitted to the Congress on August 6, 2016, pursuant to section 
4  of  the  Act,  to  encourage  the  efforts  of  countries  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa 
to  implement  national  power  strategies  and  develop  an  appropriate  mix 
of  power  solutions  to  provide  access  to  sufficient,  reliable,  affordable,  and 
sustainable  power  in  order  to  reduce  poverty  and  drive  economic  growth 
and job creation. 
Sec.  7.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department,  agency,  or

The  President 

Executive  Order  13719  of  February  9,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Federal  Privacy  Council 

7961 

Republication 

[Editorial  Note:  Executive  Order  13719,  originally  published  on  pages  7685– 
7689  in  the  Federal  Register  of  Friday,  February  12,  2016,  is  being  repub-
lished due to an inadvertent extra section line in the document.] 
By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  mission  of  the  United  States  Government  is  to  serve 
its  people.  In  order  to  accomplish  its  mission,  the  Government  lawfully 
collects,  maintains,  and  uses  large  amounts  of  information  about  people 
in a wide range of contexts. Protecting privacy in the collection and handling 
of  this  information  is  fundamental  to  the  successful  accomplishment  of 
the  Government’s  mission.  The  proper  functioning  of  Government  requires 
the  public’s  trust,  and  to  maintain  that  trust  the  Government  must  strive 
to  uphold  the  highest  standards  for  collecting,  maintaining,  and  using  per-
sonal data. Privacy has been at the heart of our democracy from its inception, 
and we need it now more than ever. 
Executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies)  already  take  seriously  their 
mission  to  protect  privacy  and  have  been  working  diligently  to  advance 
that  mission  through  existing  interagency  mechanisms.  Today’s  challenges, 
however,  require  that  we  find  even  more  effective  and  innovative  ways 
to improve the Government’s efforts. Our efforts to meet these new challenges 
and  preserve  our  core  value  of  privacy,  while  delivering  better  and  more 
effective  Government  services  for  the  American  people,  demand  leadership 
and  enhanced  coordination  and  collaboration  among  a  diverse  group  of 
stakeholders and experts. 
Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States Government that agencies 
shall  establish  an  interagency  support  structure  that:  builds  on  existing 
interagency  efforts  to  protect  privacy  and  provides  expertise  and  assistance 
to agencies; expands the skill and career development opportunities of agency 
privacy professionals; improves the management of agency privacy programs 
by  identifying  and  sharing  lessons  learned  and  best  practices;  and  promotes 
collaboration  between  and  among  agency  privacy  professionals  to  reduce 
unnecessary  duplication  of  efforts  and  to  ensure  the  effective,  efficient, 
and consistent implementation of privacy policy Government-wide. 
Sec.  2.  Policy  on  Senior  Agency  Officials  for  Privacy.  Within  120  days 
of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and 
Budget  (Director)  shall  issue  a  revised  policy  on  the  role  and  designation 
of the Senior Agency Officials for Privacy. The policy shall provide guidance 
on the Senior Agency Official for Privacy’s responsibilities at their agencies, 
required  level  of  expertise,  adequate  level  of  resources,  and  other  matters 
as  determined  by  the  Director.  Agencies  shall  implement  the  requirements 
of  the  policy  within  a  reasonable  time  frame  as  prescribed  by  the  Director 
and consistent with applicable law. 
Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. The head of each agency, consistent 
with  guidance  to  be  issued  by  the  Director  as  required  in  section  2  of 
this order, shall designate or re-designate a Senior Agency Official for Privacy 
with  the  experience  and  skills  necessary  to  manage  an  agency-wide  privacy

Notice  of  October  21,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo 

On  October  27,  2006,  by  Executive  Order  13413,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  situation  in  or  in  relation  to 
the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo  and,  pursuant  to  the  International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  ordered  related 
measures blocking the property of certain persons contributing to the conflict 
in  that  country.  The  President  took  this  action  to  deal  with  the  unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States constituted 
by  the  situation  in  or  in  relation  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo, 
which has been marked by widespread violence and atrocities that continue 
to threaten regional stability. I took additional steps to deal with this national 
emergency in Executive Order 13671 of July 8, 2014. 

The  situation  in  or  in  relation  to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  the  Congo 
continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  in 
Executive Order 13413 of October 27, 2006, as amended by Executive Order 
13671 of July 8, 2014, and the measures adopted to deal with that emergency, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  October  27,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the 
situation in or in relation to the Democratic Republic of the Congo declared 
in Executive Order 13413, as amended by Executive Order 13671. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  February  3,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Situation  in  or  in  Relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire 

On  February  7,  2006,  by  Executive  Order  13396,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency,  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  con-
stituted  by  the  situation  in  or  in  relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire  and  ordered 
related  measures  blocking  the  property  of  certain  persons  contributing  to 
the  conflict  in  Coˆte  d’Ivoire.  The  situation  in  or  in  relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire, 
which has been addressed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolu-
tion  1572  of  November  15,  2004,  and  subsequent  resolutions,  has  resulted 
in  the  massacre  of  large  numbers  of  civilians,  widespread  human  rights 
abuses,  significant  political  violence  and  unrest,  and  fatal  attacks  against 
international peacekeeping forces. 
The Government of Coˆte d’Ivoire and its people continue to make significant 
progress  in  promotion  of  democratic,  social,  and  economic  development. 
We congratulate Coˆte d’Ivoire on holding a peaceful and credible presidential 
election,  which  represents  an  important  milestone  on  the  country’s  road 
to full recovery. The United States also supports the advancement of national 
reconciliation  and  impartial  justice  in  Coˆte  d’Ivoire.  The  United  States  is 
committed  to  helping  Coˆte  d’Ivoire  strengthen  its  democracy  and  stay  on 
the  path  of  peaceful  democratic  transition,  and  we  look  forward  to  working 
with  the  Government  and  people  of  Coˆte  d’Ivoire  to  ensure  continued 
progress and lasting peace for all Ivoirians. 
While  the  Government  of  Coˆte  d’Ivoire  and  its  people  continue  to  make 
progress  towards  consolidating  democratic  gains  and  peace  and  prosperity, 
the  situation  in  or  in  relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire  continues  to  pose  an  unusual 
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the 
United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared on February 
7, 2006, and the measures adopted on that date to deal with that emergency, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  February  7,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order 13396.

Executive  Order  13739  September  14,  2016 

Termination  of  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the  Situation  in 
or  in  Relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.),  the  National  Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participa-
tion  Act,  as  amended  (22  U.S.C.  287c),  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United 
States Code, 
I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  find  that 
the  situation  that  gave  rise  to  the  declaration  of  a  national  emergency  in 
Executive  Order  13396  of  February  7,  2006,  with  respect  to  the  situation 
in  or  in  relation  to  Coˆte  d’Ivoire,  including  the  massacre  of  large  numbers 
of  civilians,  widespread  human  rights  abuses,  significant  political  violence 
and  unrest,  and  attacks  against  international  peacekeeping  forces  leading 
to  fatalities,  has  been  significantly  altered  by  the  progress  achieved  in  the 
stabilization of Coˆte d’Ivoire, including the successful conduct of the October 
2015  presidential  election,  progress  on  the  management  of  arms  and  related 
materiel, and the combating of illicit trafficking of natural resources. Accord-
ingly,  and  in  view  of  the  removal  of  multilateral  sanctions  by  the  United 
Nations Security Council in Resolution 2283, I hereby terminate the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13396, revoke that order, and further 
order: 
Section  1.  Pursuant  to  section  202(a)  of  the  NEA  (50  U.S.C.  1622(a)),  termi-
nation  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13396  shall 
not  affect  any  action  taken  or  proceeding  pending  not  finally  concluded 
or  determined  as  of  the  date  that  this  order  is  effective,  any  action  or 
proceeding  based  on  any  act  committed  prior  to  such  date,  or  any  rights 
or  duties  that  matured  or  penalties  that  were  incurred  prior  to  such  date. 
Sec.  2.  This  order  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right  or 
benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any 
party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,  its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

( 1) Rehearings not permitted.  A rehearing may not be ordered by the convening authority 

where the adjudged sentence for the case includes a sentence of dismissal, dishonorable 

discharge, or bad-conduct discharge or confinement for more than six months. 

(2) Rehearings permitted. 

(A) In  general.  Subject to  paragraph (e)(l) and subparagraphs  (e)(2)(B) 

through (e)(2)(E) of this rule, the convening authority may in the convening authority's 

discretion order a rehearing.  A rehearing  may  be  ordered  as to  some or all offenses of which 

findings of guilty were entered and the sentence, or as to the sentence only. 

(B)  When  the  convening authority may order a rehearing.  The convening 

authority may order a rehearing: 

(i)  When  taking  action  on  the  court-martial under this rule.  Prior to 

ordering a rehearing on a finding, the convening authority must disapprove the applicable finding 

and the sentence and state the reasons for disapproval of said fmding.  Prior to ordering a 

rehearing on the sentence, the convening authority must disapprove the sentence. 

(ii)  When authorized to do so by superior competent authority.  If the 

convening authority finds a rehearing as to any offenses impracticable, the convening authority 

may dismiss those specifications and, when appropriate, charges. 

(iii) Sentence reassessment.  If a superior competent authority has 

approved some of the findings of guilty and  has  authorized  a  rehearing  as  to  other  offenses 

and the sentence, the convening authority may, unless  otherwise  directed,  reassess  the  sentence 

based on the approved findings of guilty and dismiss the remaining charges.  Reassessment is 

appropriate only where the convening authority determines that the accused's sentence would

reassessed sentence is appropriate in relation to the affirmed findings of guilty."" 

(C)  Limitations. 

(i) Sentence  approved.  A  rehearing  shall  not be ordered if, in the same 

action, a sentence is approved. 

(ii) Lack of sufficient evidence.  A rehearing may  not  be  ordered  as  to 

findings  of guilty  when there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the 

findings  of guilty  of the  offense  charged or  of any  lesser  included  offense.  A  rehearing  may 

be  ordered,  however,  if the  proof of guilt  consisted of inadmissible evidence for which there is 

available an admissible substitute.  A rehearing may be ordered as to  any lesser offense included 

in an offense of which the accused was found guilty, provided there  is  sufficient  evidence  in 

the  record  to  support the  lesser included offense. 

(iii) Rehearing on  sentence  only.  A  rehearing on sentence only shall not 

be referred to a different kind of court-martial from that which made the original  findings.  If 

the  convening  authority  determines a rehearing on sentence is impracticable, the convening 

authority may approve a sentence of no punishment without conducting a rehearing. 

(D) Additional charges.  Additional charges may be referred for trial together 

with charges as to which a rehearing has been directed. 

(E) Lesser included offenses.  If at a previous trial  the  accused  was  convicted  of 

a  lesser  included offense, a rehearing may be ordered only as to that included offense or as to a 

lesser included offense of the included offense that resulted in a finding of guilty at the previous 

trial.  If, however, a rehearing is ordered improperly on the original offense charged and the

teleconference, by telephone,  or by similar means  of remote testimony.  All  testimony shall  be 

taken under  oath,  except that the  probationer  may  make  an  unsworn  statement. 

( 5) Other evidence.  If relevant to the limited purpose  of the  hearing,  and not 

cumulative,  a  hearing  officer may  consider  other  evidence,  in  addition to  or  in  lieu  of witness 

testimony,  including  statements,  tangible evidence,  or  reproductions  thereof,  offered  by  either 

side,  that the  hearing  officer  determines  is  reliable.  This  other  evidence  need not  be  sworn. 

(6) Presence  of probationer.  The  taking of evidence shall not be prevented and the 

probationer shall be considered to have waived the right to  be  present  whenever  the 

probationer: 

absent;  or 

(A) After  being  notified  of the  time  and  place  of the  proceeding  is  voluntarily 

(B) After  being  warned  by the  hearing officer that disruptive  conduct will  cause 

removal from  the proceeding, persists in conduct that  is  such  as  to  justify  exclusion  from  the 

proceeding.

(7) Objections.  Any  objection alleging  failure to  comply  with these  rules  shall  be 

made  to  the  convening  authority  via the  hearing  officer.  The hearing officer shall include a 

record of all objections in the written recommendations to the convening authority. 

(8) Access by spectators.  Vacation hearings are public proceedings and should remain 

open to the public whenever possible.  The  convening  authority  who  directed  the  hearing  or 

the  hearing  officer may restrict or foreclose access by spectators to  all  or part of the 

proceedings  if an  overriding interest exists  that  outweighs  the  value  of an  open  hearing. 

Examples of overriding interests may  include: preventing  psychological harm or trauma to  a 

child  witness  or an  alleged victim  of a  sexual  crime, protecting  the  safety  or  privacy of a 

witness  or alleged victim,  protecting classified  material,  and receiving evidence  where a 

witness  is  incapable of testifying in  an open setting.  Any closure must  be  narrowly  tailored  to 

achieve  the  overriding  interest that justified the  closure.  Convening  authorities  or  hearing 

officers  must conclude that no  lesser methods  short  of closing the hearing can be used to 

protect the  overriding interest in the case.  Convening authorities or hearing officers must 

conduct a case-by-case,  witness-by-witness,  circumstance-by-circumstance analysis of whether 

closure is  necessary.  If a convening authority or hearing  officer believes  closing the  hearing is 

necessary, the  convening authority or hearing officer must make specific fmdings of fact in 

writing  that support the closure.  The written findings  of fact must be  included in the record. 

(9)  Victim's rights.  Any victim of the underlying offense for which the probationer 

received the suspended sentence, or any victim of the alleged offense that is the subject of the 

vacation hearing, has the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of the vacation hearing. 

For purposes of this rule, the term ""victim"" is defined as an individual who has suffered  direct 

physical,  emotional, or pecuniary  harm  as  a  result of the  commission  of an  offense.""

Sec. 6.:_  Part III of the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, is amended as follows: 

(a) Mil. R.  Evid. 304(c) is amended to read as follows: 

""(c) Corroboration of a Confession or Admission. 

(1) An admission or a confession of the accused may be considered as evidence against 

the accused on the question of guilt or innocence only if independent evidence, either direct or 

circumstantial, has been admitted into evidence that would tend to establish the trustworthiness 

of the admission or confession. 

(2) Other uncorroborated confessions or admissions of the accused that would themselves 

require corroboration may not be used to supply this independent evidence.  If the independent 

evidence raises an inference of the truth of the admission or confession, then it may be 

considered as evidence against the accused.  Not every element or fact contained in the 

confession or admission must be independently proven for the confession or admission to be 

admitted into evidence in its entirety. 

(3) Corroboration is not required for a statement made by the accused before the court by 

which the accused is being tried, for statements made prior to or contemporaneously with the act, 

or for statements offered under a rule of evidence other than that pertaining to the admissibility 

of admissions or confessions. 

( 4) Quantum of Evidence Needed.  The independent evidence necessary to establish 

corroboration need not be sufficient of itself to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the truth of 

facts  stated in the admission or confession.  The independent evidence need raise only an 

inference of the truth of the admission or confession.  The amount and type of evidence 

introduced as corroboration is a factor to be considered by the trier of fact in determining the 

weight, if any, to be given to the admission or confession.

(5) Procedure.  The military judge alone is to determine when adequate evidence of 

corroboration has been received.  Corroborating evidence must be introduced before the 

admission or confession is introduced unless the military judge allows submission of such 

evidence subject to later corroboration."" 

(b) Mil. R. Evid.  311 (a) is amended to read as follows: 

""(a) General rule.  Evidence obtained as  a result of an unlawful  search  or  seizure  made  by a 

person  acting in a governmental capacity is inadmissible against the  accused if: 

(1) the accused makes a timely motion to suppress or an objection to the evidence under 

this rule; 

(2) the accused had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the person, place, or property 

searched; the  accused had a  legitimate  interest in the  property or evidence seized when 

challenging a seizure; or the  accused would otherwise  have  grounds to  object to the search or 

seizure under the Constitution of the United States as applied to members of the Armed Forces; 

and 

(3) exclusion of the evidence results in appr~ciable deterrence of future unlawful searches 

or seizures and the benefits of such deterrence outweigh the costs to the justice system."" 

(c) A new Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(4) is inserted immediately after Mil. R. Evid. 311(c)(3)(C) and 

reads as follows: 

""( 4) Reliance on Statute.  Evidence that was obtained as a result of an unlawful search or 

seizure may be used when the official seeking the evidence acts in objectively reasonable 

reliance on a statute later held violative of the Fourth Amendment."" 

(d) Mil. R. Evid. 311(d)(5)(A) is amended to read as follows:

""(A) In general.  When the defense makes an appropriate motion or objection under 

subdivision (d), the prosecution has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence 

that the evidence was not obtained as a result of an unlawful search or seizure, that the evidence 

would have been obtained even if the unlawful search or seizure had not been made, that the 

evidence was obtained by officials who reasonably and with good faith relied on the issuance of 

an authorization to search, seize, or apprehend or a search warrant or an arrest warrant; that the 

evidence was obtained by officials in objectively reasonable reliance on a statute later held 

violative of the Fourth Amendment; or that the deterrence of future unlawful searches or seizures 

is not appreciable or such deterrence does not outweigh the costs to the justice system of 

excluding the evidence."" 

(e) Mil. R. Evid. 414(d)(2)(A) is amended to read as follows: 

""(A) any conduct prohibited by Article 120 and committed with a child, or prohibited by 

Article 120b."" 

(f) Mil. R. Evid. 504 is amended to read as follows: 

""Rule  504.  Marital  privilege 

(a)  Spousal Incapacity.  A person has a privilege to refuse  to  testify  against  his  or  her 

spouse.  There is no privilege under subdivision (a) when, at the time of the testimony, the 

parties are divorced, or the marriage has been annulled. 

(b)  Confidential  Communication  Made During the Marriage. 

(1)  General Rule.  A  person has a  privilege during and after the marital relationship to 

refuse to  disclose, and to prevent another from disclosing, any confidential  communication 

made  to  the  spouse  of the  person  while  they  were  married  and not  separated  as  provided 

by  law.

(2)  Who  May Claim the Privilege.  The privilege may be  claimed by the  spouse  who 

made  the  communication or by the other spouse on his or her behalf.  The authority ofthe latter 

spouse to  do  so  is presumed  in  the  absence  of evidence  of a waiver.  The privilege will not 

prevent disclosure of the communication at the request of the spouse to whom the 

communication was made if that spouse is  an accused  regardless  of whether  the  spouse  who 

made the  communication  objects  to  its  disclosure. 

(c)  Exceptions. 

( 1) To  Confidential Communications Only.  Where both parties have been substantial 

participants in illegal activity, those communications between the spouses during the marriage 

regarding the illegal activity in which they have jointly participated are not marital 

communications for purposes of the privilege in subdivision (b) and are not entitled to protection 

under the privilege in subdivision (b). 

(2)  To  Spousal Incapacity and Confidential Communications.  There is no privilege 

under subdivisions  (a)  or  (b): 

(A) In proceedings  in which one  spouse is charged with a  crime  against the 

person or property of the  other  spouse  or  a  child  of either,  or  with  a crime  against the 

person or property of a  third  person  committed in the  course  of committing a  crime against 

the  other  spouse; 

(B)  When the marital relationship was entered into  with no  intention of the 

parties to  live together as spouses, but only for the purpose of using the purported marital 

relationship as a sham, and with respect to the privilege in subdivision (a), the relationship 

remains a sham at the time the testimony or statement of one of the parties is to be introduced

against the  other;  or with respect to  the  privilege in subdivision (b), the relationship was a 

sham at the time  of the  communication;  or 

(C) In proceedings in which a spouse is charged, in accordance with Article 

133  or 134, with importing the other spouse as an alien for prostitution or other immoral 

purpose in violation of 8 U.S.C.  § 1328;  with transporting the  other  spouse in interstate 

commerce for prostitution, immoral purposes, or another offense  in violation of 18  U.S.C.  §§ 

2421-2424;  or with violation of such other similar statutes under which such privilege may not 

be claimed in the trial of criminal cases  in the  United  States  district courts. 

(d)  Definitions.  As  used  in  this  rule: 

(1)  ""A child of either"" means a biological child, adopted child, or ward of one of the 

spouses and includes a child who is under the permanent or temporary physical custody of one 

of the spouses, regardless of the existence of a legal parent-child relationship.  For  purposes  of 

this  rule  only,  a  child is: 

(A)  an  individual  under  the  age  of 18;  or 

(B)  an individual with a mental handicap who functions  under  the  age  of  18. 

(2)  ""Temporary physical custody"" means a parent has  entrusted his  or her child  with 

another.  There is no  minimum  amount  of time  necessary to  establish temporary physical 

custody, nor is a written agreement required.  Rather, the focus is  on the parent's agreement with 

another for assuming parental responsibility for the child.  For example, temporary physical 

custody may include instances where a parent entrusts another with the care of his or her child 

for recurring care or during absences due to temporary duty  or  deployments.

wrongful it is necessary that the accused transmitted the communication for the purpose of 

issuing a threat, with the knowledge that the communication would be viewed as a threat, or 

acted recklessly with regard to whether the communication would be viewed as a threat. 

However, it is not necessary to establish that the accused actually intended to do the injury 

threatened.  Nor is the offense committed by the mere statement of intent to commit an unlawful 

act not involving injury to another.  See also paragraph 109, Threat or hoax designed or intended 

to cause panic or public fear.""

finds  there  has  been  an  unreasonable  multiplication  of  charges 

as  applied  to  findings  or  sentence. 

(i)  As  applied  to  findings.  Charges  that  arise  from 

substantially  the  same  transaction,  while  not  legally 

multiplicious,  may  still  be  unreasonably  multiplied  as  applied 

to  findings.  When  the  military  judge  finds,  in  his  or  her 

discretion,  that  the  offenses  have  been  unreasonably  multiplied, 

the  appropriate  remedy  shall  be  dismissal  of  the  lesser  offenses 

or  merger  of  the  offenses  into  one  specification. 

(ii)  As  applied  to  sentence.  Where  the  military  judge 

finds  that  the  nature  of  t~e  harm  requires  a  remedy  that  focuses 

more  appropriately  on  punishment  than  on  findings,  he  or  she  may 

find  that  there  is  an  unreasonable  multiplication  of  charges  as 

applied  to  sentence. 

If  the  military  judge  makes  such  a 

finding,  the  maximum  punishment  for  those  offenses  determined  to 

be  unreasonably  multiplied  shall  be  the  maximum  authorized 

punishment  of  the  offense  carrying  the  greatest  maximum 

punishment.""

""b.  Explanation. 

(1)  In  general.  A  lesser  offense  is  ""necessarily  included"" 

in  a  charged  offense  when  the  elements  of  the  lesser  offense  are 

a  subset  of  the  elements  of  the  charged  offense,  thereby  putting 

the  accused  on  notice  to  defend  against  the  lesser  offense  in 

addition  to  the  offense  specifically  charged.  A  lesser  offense 

may  be  ""necessarily  included""  when: 

(a)  All  of  the  elements  of  the  lesser  offense  are  included 

in  the  greater  offense,  and  the  common  elements  are  identical 

(for  example,  larceny  as  a  lesser  included  offense  of  robbery); 

(b)  All  of  the  elements  of  the  lesser  offense  are  included 

in  the  greater  offense,  but  at  least  one  element  is  a  subset  by 

being  legally  less  serious  (for  example,  housebreaking  as  a 

lesser  included  offense  of  burglary);  or 

(c)  All  of  the  eiements  of  the  lesser  offense  are  ""included 

and  necessary""  parts  of  the  greater  offense,  but  the  mental 

element  is  a  subset  by  being  legally  less  serious  (for  example, 

wrongful  appropriation  as  a  lesser  included  offense  of  larceny) . 

(2)  Sua  sponte  duty.  A  military  judge  must  instruct  panel 

members  on  lesser  included  offenses  reasonably  raised  by  the 

evidence.

included  offenses,  an  accused  may  be  found  guilty  of  any  or  all 

of  the  offenses  included  in  the  offense  charged.  For  example, 

robbery  includes  both  larceny  and  assault.  Therefore,  in  a 

proper  case,  a  court-martial  may  find  an  accused  not  guilty  of 

robbery,  but  guilty·of  wrongful  appropriation  and  assault. 

(4}  Findings  of  guilty  to  a  lesser  included  offense.  A 

court-martial  may  find  an  accused  not  guilty  of  the  offense 

charged,  but  guilty  of  a  lesser  included  offense  by  the  process 

of  exception  and  substitution.  The  court-martial  may  except 

(that  is,  delete}  the  words  in  the  specification  that  pertain  to 

the  offense  charged  and,  if  necessary,  substitute  language 

appropriate  to  the  lesser  included  offense.  For  example,-

the 

accused  is  charged  with  murder  in  violation  of  Article  118,  but 

found  guilty  of  voluntary  manslaughter  in  violation  of  Article 

119.  Such  a  finding  may  be  worded  as  follows: 

Of  the  Specification:  Guilty,  except  the  word  ""murder"" 

substituting  therefor  the  words  ""willfully  and  unlawfully  kill,"" 

of  the  excepted  word,  not  guilty,  of  the  substituted  words, 

guilty. 

Of  the  Charge:  ,Not  guilty,  but  guilty  of  a  violation 

of  Article  119. 

If  a  court-martial  finds  an  accused  guilty  of  a  lesser 

included  offense,  the  finding  as  to  the  charge  shall  state  a

Proclamation  9398  of  February  24,  2016 

Modifying  and  Continuing  the  National  Emergency  With  Re-
spect  to  Cuba  and  Continuing  To  Authorize  the  Regulation 
of  the  Anchorage  and  Movement  of  Vessels 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
By  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the 
United  States  of  America,  in  order  to  modify  and  continue  the  national 
emergency  declared  in  Proclamation  6867  of  March  1,  1996,  and  expanded 
by Proclamation 7757 of February 26, 2004, in light of the need to continue 
the  national  emergency  based  on  a  disturbance  or  threatened  disturbance 
of  the  international  relations  of  the  United  States  related  to  Cuba,  and, 
WHEREAS the descriptions of the national emergency set forth in Proclama-
tions  6867  and  7757  no  longer  reflect  the  international  relations  of  the 
United States related to Cuba; 
WHEREAS  longstanding  U.S.  policy  towards  Cuba  had,  at  times,  tended 
to  isolate  the  United  States  from  regional  and  international  partners,  con-
strained  our  ability  to  influence  outcomes  throughout  the  Western  Hemi-
sphere,  and  impaired  the  use  of  the  full  range  of  tools  available  to  the 
United States to promote positive change in Cuba; 
WHEREAS the following descriptions accurately describe the national emer-
gency with respect to Cuba; 
WHEREAS  the  United  States  and  Cuba  reestablished  diplomatic  relations 
and  opened  embassies  in  each  other’s  capitals  on  July  20,  2015,  and  the 
United  States  continues  to  pursue  the  progressive  normalization  of  relations 
while aspiring towards a peaceful, prosperous, and democratic Cuba; 
WHEREAS  the  United  States  has  committed  to  work  with  the  Government 
of  Cuba  on  matters  of  mutual  concern  that  advance  U.S.  national  interests, 
such as migration, human rights, counter-narcotics, environmental protection, 
and trafficking in persons, among other issues; 
WHEREAS  the  United  States  is  committed  to  supporting  safe,  orderly,  and 
legal migration from Cuba through the effective implementation of the 1994– 
95 U.S.-Cuba Migration Accords; 
WHEREAS  the  Cuban  economy  is  in  a  relatively  weak  state,  contributing 
to  an  outflow  of  its  nationals  towards  the  United  States  and  neighboring 
countries; 
WHEREAS the overarching objective of U.S. policy is stability in the region, 
and  the  outflow  of  Cuban  nationals  may  have  a  destabilizing  effect  on 
the United States and its neighboring countries; 
WHEREAS  it  is  United  States  policy  that  a  mass  migration  from  Cuba 
would  endanger  the  security  of  the  United  States  by  posing  a  disturbance 
or  threatened  disturbance  of  the  international  relations  of  the  United  States; 
WHEREAS the United States continues to maintain an embargo with respect 
to Cuba; 
WHEREAS  the  unauthorized  entry  of  vessels  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of 
the  United  States  into  Cuban  territorial  waters  is  in  violation  of  U.S.  law 
and contrary to U.S. policy;

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  37 / Thursday,  February  25,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

WHEREAS  the  unauthorized  entry  of  United  States-registered  vessels  into 
Cuban  territorial  waters  is  detrimental  to  the  foreign  policy  of  the  United 
States,  and  counter  to  the  purpose  of  Executive  Order  12807,  which  is 
to ensure, among other things, safe, orderly, and legal migration; 
WHEREAS the possibility of large-scale unauthorized entries of United States- 
registered  vessels  would  disturb  the  international  relations  of  the  United 
States by facilitating a possible mass migration of Cuban nationals; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  section  1  of  title  II  of 
Public  Law  65–24,  ch.  30,  June  15,  1917,  as  amended  (50  U.S.C.  191), 
sections  201,  202,  and  301  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1601  et  seq.),  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States  Code,  in  order 
to  modify  the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Proclamations 
6867  and  7757,  and  to  secure  the  observance  of  the  rights  and  obligations 
of  the  United  States,  hereby  continue  the  national  emergency  with  regard 
to Cuba as set forth above and authorize and direct the Secretary of Homeland 
Security  (the  ‘‘Secretary’’)  to  make  and  issue  such  rules  and  regulations 
as  the  Secretary  may  find  appropriate  to  regulate  the  anchorage  and  move-
ment  of  vessels,  and  authorize  and  approve  the  Secretary’s  issuance  of 
such  rules  and  regulations,  as  authorized  by  the  Act  of  June  15,  1917. 
Accordingly, I hereby direct: 
Section  1.  The  Secretary  may  make  rules  and  regulations  governing  the 
anchorage and movement of any vessel, foreign or domestic, in the territorial 
waters  of  the  United  States,  which  may  be  used,  or  is  susceptible  of  being 
used,  for  voyage  into  Cuban  territorial  waters  and  that  may  create  unsafe 
conditions,  or  result  in  unauthorized  transactions,  and  thereby  threaten  a 
disturbance of international relations. Any rule or regulation issued pursuant 
to  this  proclamation  may  be  effective  immediately  upon  issuance  as  such 
rule  or  regulation  shall  involve  a  foreign  affairs  function  of  the  United 
States. 
Sec. 2. The Secretary is authorized, to the extent consistent with international 
law,  to  inspect  any  vessel,  foreign  or  domestic,  in  the  territorial  waters 
of  the  United  States,  at  any  time;  to  place  guards  on  any  such  vessel; 
and,  with  my  consent  expressly  hereby  granted,  take  full  possession  and 
control  of  any  such  vessel  and  remove  the  officers  and  crew  and  all  other 
persons  not  specifically  authorized  by  the  Secretary  to  go  or  remain  on 
board  the  vessel  when  necessary  to  secure  the  rights  and  obligations  of 
the United States. 
Sec. 3. The Secretary may request assistance from such departments, agencies, 
officers,  or  instrumentalities  of  the  United  States  as  the  Secretary  deems 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this proclamation. Such departments, 
agencies, officers, or instrumentalities shall, consistent with other provisions 
of law and to the extent practicable, provide requested assistance. 
Sec.  4.  The  Secretary  may  seek  assistance  from  State  and  local  authorities 
in  carrying  out  the  purposes  of  this  proclamation.  Because  State  and  local 
assistance  may  be  essential  for  an  effective  response  to  this  emergency, 
I  urge  all  State  and  local  officials  to  cooperate  with  Federal  authorities 
and  to  take  all  actions  within  their  lawful  authority  necessary  to  prevent 
the  unauthorized  departure  of  vessels  intending  to  enter  Cuban  territorial 
waters. 
Sec.  5.  All  powers  and  authorities  delegated  by  this  proclamation  to  the 
Secretary  may  be  delegated  by  the  Secretary  to  other  officers  and  agents 
of the United States Government unless otherwise prohibited by law. 
Sec. 6. Any provisions of Proclamation 6867 of March 1, 1996, and expanded 
by  Proclamation  7757  of  February  26,  2004,  that  are  inconsistent  with  the 
provisions of this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsist-
ency.

Notice  of  March  29,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Sig-
nificant  Malicious  Cyber-Enabled  Activities 

On April 1, 2015, by Executive Order 13694, I declared a national emergency 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by 
the  increasing  prevalence  and  severity  of  malicious  cyber-enabled  activities 
originating  from,  or  directed  by  persons  located,  in  whole  or  in  substantial 
part, outside the United States. 
These  significant  malicious  cyber-enabled  activities  continue  to  pose  an 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy, 
and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  April  1,  2015,  and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal 
with that emergency, must continue in effect beyond April 1, 2016. Therefore, 
in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50 
U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared 
in Executive Order 13694. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States 
of America, including 5 U.S.C. 3301 and 7103(b), and in order to strengthen

ment, contractor employee fitness, eligibility for access to classified informa-

Within  90  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  and  building  on  the  strength

wide needs for example, acquisition, funding models, data security require-
ments, and contracting, and the respective roles of the Security, Suitability, 
and  Credentialing  Line  of  Business;  and  the  Enterprise  Investment  Board. 
Sec.  3.  Amendment  to  Executive  Order  12171.  Executive  Order  12171  of

Presidential  Determination  No.  2016–06  of  May  19.  2016 

Presidential  Determination  Pursuant  to  Section  1245(d)(4)(B) 
and  (C)  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal 
Year  2012 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury[, 
and]  the  Secretary  of  Energy 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States,  after  carefully  considering  the  report  submitted 
to  the  Congress  by  the  Energy  Information  Administration  on  February  9, 
2016,  and  other  relevant  factors,  including  global  economic  conditions,  in-
creased  oil  production  by  certain  countries,  the  level  of  spare  capacity, 
and  the  availability  of  strategic  reserves,  I  determine,  pursuant  to  section 
1245(d)(4)(B)  and  (C)  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal 
Year 2012, Public Law 112–81, and consistent with my prior determinations, 
that  there  is  a  sufficient  supply  of  petroleum  and  petroleum  products  from 
countries  other  than  Iran  to  permit  a  significant  reduction  in  the  volume 
of  petroleum  and  petroleum  products  purchased  from  Iran  by  or  through 
foreign  financial  institutions.  However,  consistent  with  U.S.  commitments 
specified  in  the  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action  (JCPOA),  the  United 
States  is  no  longer  pursuing  efforts  to  reduce  Iran’s  sales  of  crude  oil. 
The United States action to fulfill these commitments became effective upon 
reaching  Implementation  Day  under  the  JCPOA,  which  occurred  once  the 
International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  verified  that  Iran  had  implemented 
key  nuclear-related  steps  specified  in  the  JCPOA  to  ensure  that  its  nuclear 
program is and will remain exclusively peaceful. 
I will continue to monitor this situation closely.

Memorandum  of  December  5,  2016 

Steps  for  Increased  Legal  and  Policy  Transparency  Con-
cerning  the  United  States  Use  of  Military  Force  and  Related 
National  Security  Operations 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

Since  my  earliest  days  in  office,  I  have  emphasized  the  importance  of 
transparency and my commitment to making as much information as possible 
available  to  the  Congress  and  the  public  about  the  United  States  use  of 
military  force  and  related  national  security  operations.  Doing  so,  I  believe, 
not only supports the process of democratic decision making, but also dem-
onstrates  the  legitimacy  and  strengthens  the  sustainability  of  our  operations 
while promoting mutual understanding with our allies and partners. 

The  United  States  has  used  military  force  and  conducted  related  national 
security  operations  within  legal  and  policy  frameworks  that  are  designed 
to  ensure  that  such  operations  are  lawful  and  effective  and  that  they  serve 
our  interests  and  values.  Consistent  with  my  commitment  to  transparency, 
my  Administration  has  provided  to  the  public  an  unprecedented  amount 
of  information  regarding  these  frameworks  through  speeches,  public  state-
ments, reports, and other materials. We have attempted to explain, consistent 
with our national security and the proper functioning of the executive branch, 
when  and  why  the  United  States  conducts  such  operations,  the  legal  basis 
and  policy  parameters  for  such  operations,  and  how  such  operations  have 
unfolded, so that the American people can better understand them. 

In  addition  to  the  efforts  we  have  made  to  date,  there  is  still  more  work 
that can be done to inform the public. Thus, consistent with my Administra-
tion’s previous efforts, by this memorandum I am directing national security 
departments  and  agencies  to  take  additional  steps  to  share  with  the  public 
further information relating to the legal and policy frameworks within which 
the  United  States  uses  military  force  and  conducts  related  national  security 
operations. Accordingly, I hereby direct as follows: 

Section  1.  Report.  National  security  departments  and  agencies  shall  prepare 
for  the  President  a  formal  report  that  describes  key  legal  and  policy  frame-
works  that  currently  guide  the  United  States  use  of  military  force  and 
related  national  security  operations,  with  a  view  toward  the  report  being 
released to the public. 

Sec.  2.  Keeping  the  Public  Informed.  On  no  less  than  an  annual  basis, 
the National Security Council staff shall be asked to, as appropriate, coordi-
nate a review and update of the report described in section 1 of this memo-
randum,  provide  any  updated  report  to  the  President,  and  arrange  for  the 
report to be released to the public. 

Sec. 3. Definitions. For the purposes of this memorandum: 

‘‘National  security  departments  and  agencies’’  include  the  Departments 
of  State,  the  Treasury,  Defense,  Justice,  and  Homeland  Security,  the  Office 
of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  the  Central  Intelligence  Agency, 
and such other agencies as the President may designate.

44485 

Executive  Order  13732  of  July  1,  2016 

United  States  Policy  on  Pre-  and  Post-Strike  Measures  To 
Address  Civilian  Casualties  in  U.S.  Operations  Involving  the 
Use  of  Force 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  United  States  policy  on  civilian  casualties  resulting 
from  U.S.  operations  involving  the  use  of  force  in  armed  conflict  or  in 
the  exercise  of  the  Nation’s  inherent  right  of  self-defense  is  based  on  our 
national  interests,  our  values,  and  our  legal  obligations.  As  a  Nation,  we 
are  steadfastly  committed  to  complying  with  our  obligations  under  the  law 
of  armed  conflict,  including  those  that  address  the  protection  of  civilians, 
such  as  the  fundamental  principles  of  necessity,  humanity,  distinction,  and 
proportionality. 
The  protection  of  civilians  is  fundamentally  consistent  with  the  effective, 
efficient,  and  decisive  use  of  force  in  pursuit  of  U.S.  national  interests. 
Minimizing  civilian  casualties  can  further  mission  objectives;  help  maintain 
the  support  of  partner  governments  and  vulnerable  populations,  especially 
in  the  conduct  of  counterterrorism  and  counterinsurgency  operations;  and 
enhance  the  legitimacy  and  sustainability  of  U.S.  operations  critical  to  our 
national security. As a matter of policy, the United States therefore routinely 
imposes  certain  heightened  policy  standards  that  are  more  protective  than 
the  requirements  of  the  law  of  armed  conflict  that  relate  to  the  protection 
of civilians. 
Civilian  casualties  are  a  tragic  and  at  times  unavoidable  consequence  of 
the  use  of  force  in  situations  of  armed  conflict  or  in  the  exercise  of  a 
state’s  inherent  right  of  self-defense.  The  U.S.  Government  shall  maintain 
and  promote  best  practices  that  reduce  the  likelihood  of  civilian  casualties, 
take  appropriate  steps  when  such  casualties  occur,  and  draw  lessons  from 
our operations to further enhance the protection of civilians. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  In  furtherance  of  U.S.  Government  efforts  to  protect  civilians 
in  U.S.  operations  involving  the  use  of  force  in  armed  conflict  or  in  the 
exercise  of  the  Nation’s  inherent  right  of  self-defense,  and  with  a  view 
toward enhancing such efforts, relevant departments and agencies (agencies) 
shall  continue  to  take  certain  measures  in  present  and  future  operations. 
(a) In particular, relevant agencies shall, consistent with mission objectives 

and applicable law, including the law of armed conflict: 

(i)  train  personnel,  commensurate  with  their  responsibilities,  on  compli-
ance with legal obligations and policy guidance that address the protection 
of civilians and on implementation of best practices that reduce the likeli-
hood  of  civilian  casualties,  including  through  exercises,  pre-deployment 
training, and simulations of complex operational environments that include 
civilians; 
(ii)  develop,  acquire,  and  field  intelligence,  surveillance,  and  reconnais-
sance systems that, by enabling more accurate battlespace awareness, con-
tribute to the protection of civilians; 
(iii)  develop,  acquire,  and  field  weapon  systems  and  other  technological 
capabilities  that  further  enable  the  discriminate  use  of  force  in  different 
operational contexts;

(iv) take feasible precautions in conducting attacks to reduce the likelihood 
of civilian casualties, such as providing warnings to the civilian population 
(unless  the  circumstances  do  not  permit),  adjusting  the  timing  of  attacks, 
taking  steps  to  ensure  military  objectives  and  civilians  are  clearly  distin-
guished,  and  taking  other  measures  appropriate  to  the  circumstances;  and 
(v)  conduct  assessments  that  assist  in  the  reduction  of  civilian  casualties 
by  identifying  risks  to  civilians  and  evaluating  efforts  to  reduce  risks 
to civilians. 
(b)  In  addition  to  the  responsibilities  above,  relevant  agencies  shall  also, 
as  appropriate  and  consistent  with  mission  objectives  and  applicable  law, 
including the law of armed conflict: 

(i)  review  or  investigate  incidents  involving  civilian  casualties,  including 
by considering relevant and credible information from all available sources, 
such as other agencies, partner governments, and nongovernmental organi-
zations,  and  take  measures  to  mitigate  the  likelihood  of  future  incidents 
of civilian casualties; 
(ii)  acknowledge  U.S.  Government  responsibility  for  civilian  casualties 
and  offer  condolences,  including  ex  gratia  payments,  to  civilians  who 
are injured or to the families of civilians who are killed; 
(iii)  engage  with  foreign  partners  to  share  and  learn  best  practices  for 
reducing the likelihood of and responding to civilian casualties, including 
through appropriate training and assistance; and 
(iv)  maintain  channels  for  engagement  with  the  International  Committee 
of  the  Red  Cross  and  other  nongovernmental  organizations  that  operate 
in  conflict  zones  and  encourage  such  organizations  to  assist  in  efforts 
to  distinguish  between  military  objectives  and  civilians,  including  by  ap-
propriately  marking  protected  facilities,  vehicles,  and  personnel,  and  by 
providing  updated  information  on  the  locations  of  such  facilities  and 
personnel. 

Sec.  3.  Report  on  Strikes  Undertaken  by  the  U.S.  Government  Against  Ter-
rorist Targets Outside Areas of Active Hostilities. (a) The Director of National 
Intelligence  (DNI),  or  such  other  official  as  the  President  may  designate, 
shall  obtain  from  relevant  agencies  information  about  the  number  of  strikes 
undertaken  by  the  U.S.  Government  against  terrorist  targets  outside  areas 
of  active  hostilities  from  January  1,  2016,  through  December  31,  2016,  as 
well  as  assessments  of  combatant  and  non-combatant  deaths  resulting  from 
those strikes, and publicly release an unclassified summary of such informa-
tion  no  later  than  May  1,  2017.  By  May  1  of  each  subsequent  year,  as 
consistent  with  the  need  to  protect  sources  and  methods,  the  DNI  shall 
publicly release a report with the same information for the preceding calendar 
year. 

(b) The annual report shall also include information obtained from relevant 
agencies regarding the general sources of information and methodology used 
to conduct these assessments and, as feasible and appropriate, shall address 
the  general  reasons  for  discrepancies  between  post-strike  assessments  from 
the U.S. Government and credible reporting from nongovernmental organiza-
tions  regarding  non-combatant  deaths  resulting  from  strikes  undertaken  by 
the U.S. Government against terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities. 
(c)  In  preparing  a  report  under  this  section,  the  DNI  shall  review  relevant 
and credible post-strike all-source reporting, including such information from 
nongovernmental  sources,  for  the  purpose  of  ensuring  that  this  reporting 
is  available  to  and  considered  by  relevant  agencies  in  their  assessment 
of deaths. 

(d)  The  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National  Security  Affairs  may,  as 
appropriate, request that the head of any relevant agency conduct additional 
reviews related to the intelligence assessments of deaths from strikes against 
terrorist targets outside areas of active hostilities.

set  forth  in  this  order,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National  Security

Affairs,  through  the  National  Security  Council  staff,  will  convene  agencies 
with  relevant  defense,  counterterrorism,  intelligence,  legal,  civilian  protec-
tion, and technology expertise to consult on civilian casualty trends, consider 
potential  improvements  to  U.S.  Government  civilian  casualty  mitigation  ef-
forts, and, as appropriate, report to the Deputies and Principals Committees, 
consistent  with  Presidential  Policy  Directive  1  or  its  successor.  Specific 
incidents  will  not  be  considered  in  this  context,  and  will  continue  to  be

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13731  of  June  24,  2016 

Global  Entrepreneurship 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  American  spirit  of  entrepreneurship  is  one  of  our 
most admired values around the world, and the United States has produced 
many  of  the  world’s  most  respected  businesses  and  inspiring  business  cre-
ators.  At  a  time  when  many  societies  confront  extremism,  unemployment, 
and slow economic growth, entrepreneurship holds out the promise of oppor-
tunity, prosperity, and security. 
It is in the national interest for the Federal Government to support innovation, 
global  entrepreneurship,  and  the  American  private  sector.  Linking  entre-
preneurs  with  capital,  new  networks,  and  markets  and  providing  skills  and 
training  will  allow  them  to  grow  their  businesses  and  positively  impact 
their communities. It is also necessary that we help enable our global partners 
to  invest  in  the  tools  and  infrastructure  that  make  this  possible,  including 
high-speed  broadband;  business  incubators  and  accelerators;  regional  eco-
nomic  development  programs  and  extension  services;  international  people- 
to-people exchange programs; and the technical, export, and business assist-
ance  and  mentoring  that  entrepreneurs  need  worldwide  in  order  to  drive 
economic growth and job creation. 
This  order  sets  forth  the  administration  and  goals  of  several  programs  de-
signed  to  connect  American  and  foreign  entrepreneurs  with  the  Federal 
Government  and  promote  entrepreneurship  across  the  United  States  and 
around  the  world  by  sharing  the  knowledge,  experience,  and  connectivity 
necessary to help develop the next generation of entrepreneurs. 
Sec.  2.  Administration  of  the  Presidential  Ambassadors  for  Global  Entrepre-
neurship Program. (a) The Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) shall administer 
the  Presidential  Ambassadors  for  Global  Entrepreneurship  Program  (PAGE 
Program)  to  enable  individuals  who  exemplify  the  spirit  of  American  entre-
preneurship  and  who  have  proven  track  records  to  use  their  networks, 
platforms,  and  voices  to  support  aspiring  entrepreneurs  and  advance  public 
policies  that  encourage  entrepreneurship  in  the  United  States  and  around 
the  globe.  Individuals  selected  for  participation  in  the  PAGE  Program  shall 
be known as PAGE Members. 

(b)  The  PAGE  Program  shall  be  administered  by  a  Director,  appointed 
by  the  Secretary  under  authorities  of  the  Department  of  Commerce  (Com-
merce). Commerce shall provide necessary staff, resources, and administrative 
support  for  the  PAGE  Program  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  within 
existing appropriations. 
Sec.  3.  PAGE  Advisory  Board.  (a)  The  Secretary  shall  establish  an  Advisory 
Board  to  advise  the  Secretary  by  recommending  such  priorities,  standards, 
and  partnerships  as  may  be  beneficial  to  fulfill  the  goals  of  the  PAGE 
Program and to identify potential opportunities for PAGE Members to support 
the PAGE Program. 

(b)  The  Secretary  shall  serve  as  Chair  of  the  Advisory  Board.  In  addition 
to  the  Chair,  the  membership  of  the  Advisory  Board  shall  include  the  Sec-
retary of State, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
Development  (USAID),  the  Administrator  of  the  Small  Business  Administra-
tion  (SBA),  and  the  Administrator  of  the  National  Aeronautics  and  Space 
Administration  (NASA),  or  their  designees,  and  such  other  representatives

78701 

Executive  Order  13747  of  November  4,  2016 

Advancing  the  Global  Health  Security  Agenda  To  Achieve  a 
World  Safe  and  Secure  From  Infectious  Disease  Threats 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  As  articulated  in  the  National  Strategy  for  Countering 
Biological Threats and implemented in Presidential Policy Directive 2 (PPD– 
2),  promoting  global  health  security  is  a  core  tenet  of  our  national  strategy 
for  countering  biological  threats.  No  single  nation  can  be  prepared  if  other 
nations  remain  unprepared  to  counter  biological  threats;  therefore,  it  is  the 
policy  of  the  United  States  to  advance  the  Global  Health  Security  Agenda 
(GHSA), which is a multi-faceted, multi-country initiative intended to accel-
erate  partner  countries’  measurable  capabilities  to  achieve  specific  targets 
to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  infectious  disease  threats  (GHSA  targets), 
whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental. The roles, responsibil-
ities,  and  activities  described  in  this  order  will  support  the  goals  of  the 
International Health Regulations (IHR) and will be conducted, as appropriate, 
in coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agri-
culture  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO),  World  Organisation  for 
Animal  Health  (OIE),  Global  Partnership  Against  the  Spread  of  Weapons 
and Materials of Mass Destruction, the International Criminal Police Organi-
zation  (INTERPOL),  and  other  relevant  organizations  and  stakeholders.  To 
advance the achievement of the GHSA targets and to support the implementa-
tion of the IHR within partner countries, each executive department, agency, 
and  office  (agency)  shall,  as  appropriate,  partner,  consult,  and  coordinate 
with  other  governments,  international  financial  institutions,  international 
organizations, regional organizations, economic communities, and nongovern-
mental stakeholders, including the private sector. 
Sec. 2. GHSA Interagency Review Council. 

(a)  GHSA  Coordination  and  Policy  Development.  In  furtherance  of  the 
policy  described  in  section  1  of  this  order,  I  hereby  direct  the  National 
Security  Council  staff,  in  accordance  with  the  procedures  and  requirements 
in  Presidential  Policy  Directive  1  (or  any  successor  directive),  to  convene 
a GHSA Interagency Review Council (Council) to perform the responsibilities 
described  in  this  order.  The  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National  Security 
Affairs,  in  coordination  with  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Homeland 
Security  and  Counterterrorism,  shall  designate  a  member  of  the  National 
Security  Council  staff  to  serve  as  Chair  for  the  Council.  The  Council  shall 
meet  not  less  than  four  times  per  year  to  advance  its  mission  and  fulfill 
its responsibilities. 

(b) GHSA Interagency Review Council Responsibilities. 
(i) The Council shall be responsible for the following activities: 

(A) Provide, by consensus, policy-level guidance to participating agencies 

on GHSA goals, objectives, and implementation. 

(B)  Facilitate  interagency,  multi-sectoral  engagement  to  carry  out  GHSA 

implementation. 

(C)  Provide  a  forum  for  raising  and  working  to  resolve  interagency 

disagreements concerning the GHSA.

milestones  outlined  in  GHSA  national  plans  for  those  countries  where 
the  United  States  Government  has  committed  to  assist  in  implementing 
the GHSA and in annual work-plans outlining agency priorities for imple-
menting  the  GHSA;  and  external  evaluations  of  United  States  and  partner

ommendations  to  resolve,  mitigate,  or  otherwise  address  the  challenges

Executive  Order  13750  of  November  29,  2016 

Providing  for  the  Appointment  of  Alumni  of  the  Fulbright 
U.S.  Student  Program,  the  Benjamin  A.  Gilman  International 
Scholarship  Program,  and  the  Critical  Language  Scholarship 
Program  to  the  Competitive  Service 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  sections  3301  and  3302 
of  title  5,  United  States  Code,  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States 
Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  Federal  Government  benefits  from  a  workforce  that 
can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates 
for  our  highly  competitive,  merit-based  positions.  The  issuance  of  an  order 
granting Non-Competitive Eligibility (NCE) to certain alumni of the Fulbright 
U.S.  Student  Program,  the  Benjamin  A.  Gilman  International  Scholarship 
Program, and the Critical Language Scholarship (CLS) Program, all of which 
are  academic  exchange  programs  carried  out  under  the  authorities  of  the 
Mutual  Educational  and  Cultural  Exchange  Act  of  1961,  Public  Law  87– 
256, as amended, also known as the Fulbright-Hays Act, and the International 
Academic  Opportunity  Act  of  2000,  title  III  of  Public  Law  106–309,  would 
be  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Federal  Government.  Participants  in  these 
programs develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and cultural 
competence in regions that are strategically, diplomatically, and economically 
important to the United States. It is in the interest of the Federal Government 
to  retain  the  services  of  these  highly  skilled  individuals,  particularly  given 
that  the  Federal  Government  aided  them  in  the  acquisition  of  their  skills. 
Participants  in  the  Fulbright,  Gilman,  and  CLS  programs  are  drawn  from 
highly  competitive,  merit-based  national  selection  processes  to  which  a  vet-
erans’  preference  applies  to  ensure  that  the  most  qualified  individuals  are 
selected. 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  my  authority  under  5  U.S.C.  3302(1),  and  in  order 
to achieve a workforce that is drawn from all segments of society as provided 
in  5  U.S.C.  2301(b)(1),  I  find  that  conditions  of  good  administration  make 
necessary  an  exception  to  the  competitive  hiring  rules  for  certain  positions 
in the Federal civil service. 
Sec.  2.  Establishment.  The  head  of  any  agency  in  the  executive  branch 
may  appoint  in  the  competitive  service  any  person  who  is  certified  by 
the  Secretary  of  State  or  designee  as  having  participated  successfully  in 
the  Fulbright,  Gilman,  or  CLS  international  exchange  programs,  and  who 
passes  such  examination  as  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM) 
may prescribe. 
Sec.  3.  The  Secretary  of  State  or  designee  shall  issue  certificates,  upon 
request, to persons whom the Department of State determines have completed 
the requirements of a program described in section 1 of this order. 
Sec.  4.  Any  appointment  under  this  order  shall  be  effected  within  a  period 
of  1  year  after  completion  of  the  appointee’s  participation  in  the  programs 
described  in  section  1.  Such  period  may  be  extended  to  not  more  than 
3  years  for  persons  who,  following  participation  in  the  programs  described 
in  section  1,  are  engaged  in  military  service,  in  the  pursuit  of  studies 
at  an  institution  of  higher  learning,  or  in  other  activities  which,  in  the 
view  of  the  appointing  authority,  warrant  an  extension  of  such  period.

Memorandum  of  October  5,  2016 

Promoting  Diversity  and  Inclusion  in  the  National  Security 
Workforce 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

Our  greatest  asset  in  protecting  the  homeland  and  advancing  our  interests 
abroad  is  the  talent  and  diversity  of  our  national  security  workforce.  Under 
my  Administration,  we  have  made  important  progress  toward  harnessing 
the  extraordinary  range  of  backgrounds,  cultures,  perspectives,  skills,  and 
experiences  of  the  U.S.  population  toward  keeping  our  country  safe  and 
strong.  As  the  United  States  becomes  more  diverse  and  the  challenges  we 
face more complex, we must continue to invest in policies to recruit, retain, 
and  develop  the  best  and  brightest  from  all  segments  of  our  population. 
Research has shown that diverse groups are more effective at problem solving 
than homogeneous groups, and policies that promote diversity and inclusion 
will  enhance  our  ability  to  draw  from  the  broadest  possible  pool  of  talent, 
solve  our  toughest  challenges,  maximize  employee  engagement  and  innova-
tion,  and  lead  by  example  by  setting  a  high  standard  for  providing  access 
to opportunity to all segments of our society. 
The  purpose  of  this  memorandum  is  to  provide  guidance  to  the  national 
security  workforce  in  order  to  strengthen  the  talent  and  diversity  of  their 
respective organizations. That workforce, which comprises more than 3 mil-
lion people, includes the following departments, agencies, offices, and other 
entities  (agencies)  that  are  primarily  engaged  in  diplomacy,  development, 
defense, intelligence, law enforcement, and homeland security: 1) Department 
of  State:  Civil  Service  and  Foreign  Service;  2)  United  States  Agency  for 
International  Development  (USAID):  Civil  Service  and  Foreign  Service;  3) 
Department  of  Defense  (DOD):  commissioned  officers,  enlisted  personnel, 
and  civilian  personnel;  4)  the  17  members  of  the  Intelligence  Community; 
5)  Department  of  the  Treasury:  Office  of  International  Affairs  and  Office 
of Critical Infrastructure Protection; 6) Department of Justice: National Secu-
rity  Division  and  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation;  and  7)  Department  of 
Homeland Security. 
The data collected by these agencies do not capture the full range of diversity 
in  the  national  security  workforce,  but  where  data  allow  for  broad  compari-
son, they indicate that agencies in this workforce are less diverse on average 
than  the  rest  of  the  Federal  Government.  For  example,  as  of  2015,  only 
the  Department  of  State  and  USAID  Civil  Services  were  more  diverse  in 
terms  of  gender,  race,  and  ethnicity  than  the  Federal  workforce  as  a  whole. 
When comparing the agencies’ workforces to their leadership personnel (Sen-
ior  Executive  Service  (SES)  or  its  equivalent),  all  agencies’  leadership  staffs 
were  less  diverse  than  their  respective  workforces  in  terms  of  gender,  and 
all  but  DOD  enlisted  personnel  and  USAID  Civil  Service  had  less  diverse 
leadership in terms of race and ethnicity. While these data do not necessarily 
indicate  the  existence  of  barriers  to  equal  employment  opportunity,  we 
can  do  more  to  promote  diversity  in  the  national  security  workforce,  con-
sistent with merit system principles and applicable law. 
When  I  issued  Executive  Order  13583  of  August  18,  2011  (Establishing 
a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion 
in the Federal Workforce), I directed all departments and agencies to develop 
and  implement  a  more  comprehensive,  integrated,  and  strategic  focus  on 
diversity and inclusion. This memorandum supports that effort by providing

guidance  that  1)  emphasizes  a  data-driven  approach  in  order  to  increase 
transparency  and  accountability  at  all  levels;  2)  takes  into  account  leading 
practices,  research,  and  experience  from  the  private  and  public  sectors; 
and  3)  complements  ongoing  actions  that  agencies  are  taking  pursuant  to 
Executive  Order  13583  and  under  the  leadership  of  the  Diversity  and  Inclu-
sion  in  Government  Council,  including  but  not  limited  to  efforts  related 
to  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  disability  status,  veterans,  sexual  orientation  and 
gender  identity,  and  other  demographic  categories.  This  memorandum  also 
supports  Executive  Order  13714  of  December  15,  2015  (Strengthening  the 
Senior  Executive  Service),  by  directing  agencies  to  take  additional  steps 
to expand the pipeline of diverse talent into senior positions. 
This  memorandum  also  aligns  with  congressional  efforts  to  promote  the 
diversity  of  the  national  security  workforce,  which  have  been  reflected  in 
legislation such as the: 
•  Foreign  Service  Act  of  1980,  which  urged  the  Department  of  State 
to  develop  policies  to  encourage  the  ‘‘entry  into  and  advancement  in  the 
Foreign Service by persons from all segments of American society’’; 

• Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which called 
on the Intelligence Community to prescribe personnel policies and programs 
that ensure its personnel ‘‘are sufficiently diverse for purposes of the collec-
tion  and  analysis  of  intelligence  through  the  recruitment  and  training  of 
women,  minorities,  and  individuals  with  diverse  ethnic,  cultural,  and  lin-
guistic backgrounds’’; and 

•  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2013,  which  man-
dated  that  the  U.S.  military  develop  and  implement  a  plan  to  accurately 
measure  the  efforts  of  the  military  to  ‘‘achieve  a  dynamic,  sustainable  level 
of members of the armed forces (including reserve components) that, among 
both  commissioned  officers  and  senior  enlisted  personnel  of  each  armed 
force,  will  reflect  the  diverse  population  of  the  United  States  eligible  to 
serve  in  the  armed  forces,  including  gender  specific,  racial,  and  ethnic 
populations.’’ 
Promoting  diversity  and  inclusion  within  the  national  security  workforce 
must be a joint effort and requires engagement by senior leadership, managers, 
and  the  entire  workforce,  as  well  as  effective  collaboration  among  those 
responsible for human resources, equal employment opportunity, and diver-
sity and inclusion issues. In implementing the guidance in this memorandum, 
agencies  shall  ensure  their  diversity  and  inclusion  practices  are  fully  inte-
grated  into  broader  succession  planning  efforts  and  supported  by  sufficient 
resource allocations and effective programs that invest in personnel develop-
ment and engagement. Where appropriate, they shall also support, coordinate, 
and  encourage  research  and  other  efforts  by  the  Federal  Government  to 
expand  the  knowledge  base  of  best  practices  for  broadening  participation 
and understanding the impact of diversity and inclusion on national security, 
including in the fields of science and technology. 
Therefore,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct  the  following: 
Section  1.  Collection,  Analysis,  and  Dissemination  of  Workforce  Data.  Al-
though  collected  data  do  not  necessarily  indicate  the  existence  of  barriers 
to  equal  employment  opportunity,  the  collection  and  analysis  of  metrics 
allows agencies to assess their workforce talent gaps, as well as the effective-
ness  of  their  diversity  and  inclusion  efforts  and  the  adequacy  of  their  re-
sources  to  address  these  gaps.  The  dissemination  of  data  to  the  public 
and  to  agency  personnel  may  increase  the  transparency  and  accountability 
of  their  efforts.  Accordingly,  agencies  in  the  national  security  workforce 
shall: 

(a)  Make  aggregate  demographic  data  and  other  information  available 
to  the  public  and  broader  workforce.  Agencies  shall  make  available  to  the 
general  public  information  on  the  state  of  diversity  and  inclusion  in  their 
workforces.  That  information,  which  shall  be  updated  at  least  once  a  year, 
shall  include  aggregate  demographic  data  by  workforce  or  service  and  grade

or  rank;  attrition  and  promotion  demographic  data;  validated  inclusion 
metrics  such  as  the  New  Inclusion  Quotient  (New  IQ)  index  score;  demo-
graphic  comparisons  to  the  relevant  civilian  labor  force;  and  unclassified 
reports  and  barrier  analyses  related  to  diversity  and  inclusion.  Agencies 
may  publish  data  in  proportions  or  percentages  to  account  for  classification 
concerns,  and  the  Intelligence  Community  may  publish  a  community-wide 
report  with  the  data  outlined  in  this  section.  In  addition,  agencies  shall 
provide  to  their  workforces,  including  senior  leadership  at  the  Secretary 
or  Director  level,  a  report  that  includes  demographic  data  and  information 
on  the  status  of  diversity  and  inclusion  efforts  no  later  than  90  days  after 
the  date  of  this  memorandum  and  on  an  annual  basis  thereafter  (or  in 
line  with  existing  annual  reporting  requirements  related  to  these  issues, 
if any). 

(b)  Expand  the  collection  and  analysis  of  voluntary  applicant  flow  data. 
Applicant  flow  data  tracks  the  selection  rate  variances  for  job  positions 
among different demographic categories and can assist agencies in examining 
the  fairness  and  inclusiveness  of  their  recruitment  efforts.  Agencies  shall 
develop  a  system  to  collect  and  analyze  applicant  flow  data  for  as  many 
positions  as  practicable  in  order  to  identify  future  areas  for  improvement 
in  attracting  diverse  talent,  with  particular  attention  to  senior  and  manage-
ment  positions.  The  collection  of  data  may  be  implemented  in  a  phased 
approach commensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall include such 
analysis,  including  the  percentage  and  level  of  positions  for  which  data 
are  collected,  and  any  resulting  policy  changes  or  recommendations  in  the 
report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum. 

(c)  Identify  additional  categories  for  voluntary  data  collection  of  current 
employees. The Federal Government provides minimum reporting categories 
for agencies collecting race and ethnicity information in the Office of Manage-
ment  and  Budget’s  (OMB)  Statistical  Policy  Directive  ‘‘Standards  for  Main-
taining,  Collecting,  and  Presenting  Federal  Data  on  Race  and  Ethnicity.’’ 
That standard also encourages agencies to collect more detailed data, which 
can  be  compared  by  aggregating  such  data  into  minimum  categories  when 
necessary.  Further,  agencies  may  also  collect  additional  demographic  data, 
such  as  information  regarding  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity.  No 
later  than  90  days  after  the  date  of  this  memorandum,  agencies  shall  deter-
mine  whether  they  recommend  the  voluntary  collection  of  more  detailed 
demographic  data  on  additional  categories.  This  process  shall  involve  close 
consultation with internal stakeholders, such as employee resource or affinity 
groups;  clear  communication  with  the  workforce  to  explain  the  purpose 
of,  legal  protections  related  to,  and  anticipated  use  of  such  data;  and  adher-
ence  to  relevant  standards  and  guidance  issued  by  the  Federal  Government. 
Any  determinations  shall  be  submitted  to  OMB,  the  Office  of  Personnel 
Management  (OPM),  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission,  and 
the Department of Labor for consideration. 
Sec. 2. Provision of Professional Development Opportunities and Tools Con-
sistent  with  Merit  System  Principles.  An  inclusive  work  environment  en-
hances agencies’ ability to retain and sustain a strong workforce by allowing 
all  employees  to  perform  at  their  full  potential  and  maximize  their  talent. 
Professional  development  opportunities  and  tools  are  key  to  fostering  that 
potential,  and  each  agency  should  make  it  a  priority  to  ensure  that  all 
employees  have  access  to  them  consistent  with  merit  system  principles. 
Agencies in the national security workforce shall therefore: 

(a)  Conduct  stay  and  exit  interviews  or  surveys.  Agencies  shall  conduct 
periodic interviews with a representative cross-section of personnel to under-
stand  their  reasons  for  staying  with  their  organization,  as  well  as  to  receive 
feedback on workplace policies, professional development opportunities, and 
other  issues  affecting  their  decision  to  remain.  They  shall  also  provide 
an  opportunity  for  exit  interviews  or  surveys  of  all  departing  personnel 
to understand better their reasons for leaving. Agencies shall include analysis 
from  the  interviews  and  surveys—including  if  and  how  the  results  of  the 
interviews  differ  by  gender,  race  and  national  origin,  sexual  orientation,

gender identity, disability status, and other demographic variables—and any 
resulting policy changes or recommendations in the report required by section 
1(a) of this memorandum. 

(b) Expand provision of professional development and career advancement 
opportunities.  Agencies  shall  prioritize  resources  to  expand  professional  de-
velopment  opportunities  that  support  mission  needs,  such  as  academic  pro-
grams, private-public exchanges, and detail assignments to relevant positions 
in private or international organizations; State, local, and tribal governments; 
or  other  branches  of  the  Federal  Government.  In  addition,  agencies  in  the 
national  security  workforce  shall  offer,  or  sponsor  employees  to  participate 
in,  an  SES  Candidate  Development  Program  (CDP)  or  other  programs  that 
train  employees  to  gain  the  skills  required  for  senior-level  agency  appoint-
ments.  In  determining  which  employees  are  granted  professional  develop-
ment  or  career  advancement  opportunities,  agencies  shall  ensure  their  SES 
CDP comports with the provisions of 5 C.F.R. part 412, subpart C, including 
merit  staffing  and  assessment  requirements.  Agencies  shall  also  consider 
the  number  of  expected  senior-level  vacancies  as  a  factor  in  determining 
the  number  of  candidates  to  select  for  such  programs.  Agencies  shall  track 
the  demographics  of  program  participants  as  well  as  the  rate  of  placement 
into  senior-level  positions  for  participants  in  such  programs,  evaluate  such 
data on an annual basis to look for ways to improve outreach and recruitment 
for  these  programs  consistent  with  merit  system  principles,  and  include 
such data in the report required by section 1(a) of this memorandum. 

(c) Institute a review process for security and counterintelligence determina-
tions  that  result  in  assignment  restrictions.  For  agencies  in  the  national 
security  workforce  that  place  assignment  restrictions  on  personnel  or  other-
wise prohibit certain geographic assignments due to a security determination, 
these  agencies  shall  ensure  a  review  process  exists  consistent  with  the 
Adjudicative  Guidelines  for  Determining  Eligibility  for  Access  to  Classified 
Information,  as  well  as  applicable  counterintelligence  considerations.  Agen-
cies  shall  ensure  that  affected  personnel  are  informed  of  the  right  to  seek 
review and the process for doing so. 
Sec.  3.  Strengthening  of  Leadership  Engagement  and  Accountability.  Senior 
leadership  and  supervisors  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  diversity 
and  inclusion  in  the  workforce  they  lead  and  in  setting  an  example  for 
cultivating  talent  consistent  with  merit  system  principles.  Toward  that  end, 
agencies in the national security workforce shall: 

(a) Reward and recognize efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Agen-
cies  are  strongly  encouraged  to  consider  implementing  performance  and 
advancement  requirements  that  reward  and  recognize  senior  leaders’  and 
supervisors’  efforts  in  fostering  an  inclusive  environment  and  cultivating 
talent consistent with merit system principles, such as through participation 
in  mentoring  programs  or  sponsorship  initiatives,  recruitment  events,  and 
other  opportunities.  They  are  also  encouraged  to  create  opportunities  for 
senior  leadership  and  supervisors  to  participate  in  outreach  events  and 
to  discuss  issues  related  to  diversity  and  inclusion  with  the  workforce  on 
a regular basis, including with employee resource groups. 

(b)  Collect  and  disseminate  voluntary  demographic  data  of  external  advi-
sory committees and boards. For agencies in the national security workforce 
that  have  external  advisory  committees  or  boards  to  which  their  senior 
leadership  appoints  members,  they  are  strongly  encouraged  to  collect  vol-
untary  demographic  data  from  the  members  of  committee  and  boards,  and 
to  include  such  data  in  the  information  and  report  required  by  section 
1(a) of this memorandum. 

(c)  Expand  training  on  unconscious  bias,  inclusion,  and  flexible  work 
policies.  Agencies  shall  expand  their  provision  of  training  on  implicit  or 
unconscious  bias,  inclusion,  and  flexible  work  policies  and  make  implicit 
or  unconscious  bias  training  mandatory  for  senior  leadership  and  manage-
ment  positions,  as  well  as  for  those  responsible  for  outreach,  recruitment, 
hiring,  career  development,  promotion,  and  security  clearance  adjudication.

The  provision  of  training  may  be  implemented  in  a  phased  approach  com-
mensurate with agency resources. Agencies shall also make available training 
for  bureaus,  directorates,  or  divisions  whose  inclusion  scores,  such  as  those 
measured  by  the  New  IQ  index,  consistently  rank  below  the  agency-wide 
average  3  or  more  years  in  a  row.  Agencies  should  give  special  attention 
to  ensuring  the  continuous  incorporation  of  research-based  best  practices, 
including those to address the intersectionality between certain demographics 
and job positions. 
Sec.  4.  Reporting  on  Progress.  No  later  than  120  days  after  the  date  of 
this  memorandum,  and  on  an  annual  basis  thereafter,  the  Assistant  to  the 
President  for  National  Security  Affairs,  in  consultation  with  the  Directors 
of  OMB  and  OPM,  shall  report  to  the  President  on  the  progress  of  the 
national security workforce in implementing the requirements of this memo-
randum,  based  on  information  provided  by  relevant  departments  and  agen-
cies. 
Sec.  5.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department,  agency,  or 
the  head  thereof,  or  the  status  of  that  department  or  agency  within  the 
Federal Government; or 
(ii) the functions of the Director of OMB relating to budgetary, administra-
tive, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable 

law, and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c)  This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right 
or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by 
any  party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

Presidential Documents

Order  of  December  2,  2016 

Regarding  the  Proposed  Acquisition  of  a  Controlling  Interest 
in  Aixtron  SE  by  Grand  Chip  Investment  GmbH 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  section  721  of  the  Defense 
Production Act of 1950, as amended (section 721), 50 U.S.C. 4565, 
Section 1. Findings. I hereby make the following findings: 

(a)  There  is  credible  evidence  that  leads  me  to  believe  that:  (1)  Grand 
Chip  Investment  GmbH,  a  limited  liability  company  organized  under  the 
laws  of  the  Federal  Republic  of  Germany  (Grand  Chip);  (2)  Grand  Chip’s 
parent companies Grand Chip Investment S.a.r.l., a company organized under 
the  laws  of  the  Grand  Duchy  of  Luxembourg  (GC  Investment),  and  Fujian 
Grand  Chip  Investment  Fund  LP,  a  limited  partnership  organized  under 
the  laws  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (Fujian  Grand);  and  (3)  Fujian 
Grand’s  partners,  Mr.  Zhendong  Liu,  a  citizen  of  the  People’s  Republic 
of  China  (Mr.  Liu),  and  Xiamen  Bohao  Investment  Co.  Ltd.,  a  company 
organized  under  the  laws  of  the  People’s  Republic  of  China  (Xiamen  Bohao 
and,  together  with  Grand  Chip,  GC  Investment,  Fujian  Grand,  and  Mr.  Liu, 
the Purchasers), through exercising control of the U.S. business of AIXTRON 
SE., a company organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany 
(Aixtron),  might  take  action  that  threatens  to  impair  the  national  security 
of  the  United  States.  The  U.S.  business  of  Aixtron  consists  of  AIXTRON, 
Inc.,  a  California  corporation,  the  equity  interests  of  AIXTRON,  Inc.,  and 
any  asset  of  Aixtron  or  AIXTRON,  Inc.  used  in,  or  owned  for  the  use 
in  or  benefit  of,  the  activities  in  interstate  commerce  in  the  United  States 
of  AIXTRON,  Inc.,  including  without  limitation  any  interest  in  any  patents 
issued  by,  and  any  interest  in  any  patent  applications  pending  with,  the 
United  States  Patent  and  Trademark  Office  (collectively,  Aixtron  US);  and 
(b)  Provisions  of  law,  other  than  section  721  and  the  International  Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, 
provide  adequate  and  appropriate  authority  for  me  to  protect  the  national 
security in this matter. 
Sec.  2.  Actions  Ordered  and  Authorized.  On  the  basis  of  the  findings  set 
forth in section 1 of this order, considering the factors described in subsection 
721(f),  as  appropriate,  and  pursuant  to  my  authority  under  applicable  law, 
including section 721, I hereby order that: 

(a)  The  proposed  acquisition  of  Aixtron  US  by  the  Purchasers  is  hereby 
prohibited,  and  any  substantially  equivalent  transaction,  whether  effected 
directly or indirectly through the Purchasers’ shareholders, partners, subsidi-
aries, or affiliates is prohibited. 

(b)  In  order  to  effectuate  this  order,  the  Purchasers  and  Aixtron  shall 
take  all  steps  necessary  to  fully  and  permanently  abandon  the  proposed 
acquisition  of  Aixtron  US  not  later  than  30  days  after  the  date  of  this 
order, unless such date is extended by the Committee on Foreign Investment 
in  the  United  States  (CFIUS)  for  a  period  not  to  exceed  90  days,  on  such 
written  conditions  as  CFIUS  may  require.  Immediately  upon  completion 
of  all  steps  necessary  to  terminate  the  proposed  acquisition  of  Aixtron  US, 
the  Purchasers  and  Aixtron  shall  certify  in  writing  to  CFIUS  that  such 
termination  has  been  effected  in  accordance  with  this  order  and  that  all

Presidential Documents

88609 

Executive  Order  13751  of  December  5,  2016 

Safeguarding  the  Nation  From  the  Impacts  of  Invasive  Spe-
cies 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  to 
ensure  the  faithful  execution  of  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America, 
including  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act  of  1969,  as  amended  (42 
U.S.C.  4321  et  seq.),  the  Nonindigenous  Aquatic  Nuisance  Prevention  and 
Control  Act  of  1990,  (16  U.S.C.  4701  et  seq.),  the  Plant  Protection  Act 
(7  U.S.C.  7701  et  seq.),  the  Lacey  Act,  as  amended  (18  U.S.C.  42,  16  U.S.C. 
3371–3378  et  seq.),  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973,  as  amended  (16 
U.S.C.  1531  et  seq.),  the  Noxious  Weed  Control  and  Eradication  Act  of 
2004  (7  U.S.C.  7781  et  seq.),  and  other  pertinent  statutes,  to  prevent  the 
introduction  of  invasive  species  and  provide  for  their  control,  and  to  mini-
mize  the  economic,  plant,  animal,  ecological,  and  human  health  impacts 
that invasive species cause, it is hereby ordered as follows: 

Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to prevent the introduc-
tion,  establishment,  and  spread  of  invasive  species,  as  well  as  to  eradicate 
and  control  populations  of  invasive  species  that  are  established.  Invasive 
species  pose  threats  to  prosperity,  security,  and  quality  of  life.  They  have 
negative  impacts  on  the  environment  and  natural  resources,  agriculture  and 
food production systems, water resources, human, animal, and plant health, 
infrastructure,  the  economy,  energy,  cultural  resources,  and  military  readi-
ness.  Every  year,  invasive  species  cost  the  United  States  billions  of  dollars 
in economic losses and other damages. 

Of  substantial  growing  concern  are  invasive  species  that  are  or  may  be 
vectors,  reservoirs,  and  causative  agents  of  disease,  which  threaten  human, 
animal,  and  plant  health.  The  introduction,  establishment,  and  spread  of 
invasive species create the potential for serious public health impacts, espe-
cially when considered in the context of changing climate conditions. Climate 
change influences the establishment, spread, and impacts of invasive species. 

Executive  Order  13112  of  February  3,  1999  (Invasive  Species),  called  upon 
executive departments and agencies to take steps to prevent the introduction 
and  spread  of  invasive  species,  and  to  support  efforts  to  eradicate  and 
control  invasive  species  that  are  established.  Executive  Order  13112  also 
created  a  coordinating  body—the  Invasive  Species  Council,  also  referred 
to  as  the  National  Invasive  Species  Council—to  oversee  implementation 
of the order, encourage proactive planning and action, develop recommenda-
tions  for  international  cooperation,  and  take  other  steps  to  improve  the 
Federal  response  to  invasive  species.  Past  efforts  at  preventing,  eradicating, 
and controlling invasive species demonstrated that collaboration across Fed-
eral,  State,  local,  tribal,  and  territorial  government;  stakeholders;  and  the 
private  sector  is  critical  to  minimizing  the  spread  of  invasive  species  and 
that  coordinated  action  is  necessary  to  protect  the  assets  and  security  of 
the United States. 

This  order  amends  Executive  Order  13112  and  directs  actions  to  continue 
coordinated Federal prevention and control efforts related to invasive species. 
This  order  maintains  the  National  Invasive  Species  Council  (Council)  and 
the  Invasive  Species  Advisory  Committee;  expands  the  membership  of  the 
Council;  clarifies  the  operations  of  the  Council;  incorporates  considerations

ment and minimize the impacts of invasive species; and 

(3) refrain from authorizing, funding, or implementing actions that are likely 
to  cause  or  promote  the  introduction,  establishment,  or  spread  of  invasive 
species  in  the  United  States  unless,  pursuant  to  guidelines  that  it  has  pre-
scribed,  the  agency  has  determined  and  made  public  its  determination  that 
the  benefits  of  such  actions  clearly  outweigh  the  potential  harm  caused 
by invasive species; and that all feasible and prudent measures to minimize 
risk of harm will be taken in conjunction with the actions. 

(c)  Federal  agencies  shall  pursue  the  duties  set  forth  in  this  section  in 
coordination,  to  the  extent  practicable,  with  other  member  agencies  of  the 
Council  and  staff,  consistent  with  the  National  Invasive  Species  Council 
Management Plan, and in cooperation with State, local, tribal, and territorial 
governments,  and  stakeholders,  as  appropriate,  and  in  consultation  with 
the Department of State when Federal agencies are working with international 
organizations and foreign nations. 

(d)  Federal  agencies  that  are  members  of  the  Council,  and  Federal  inter-
agency  bodies  working  on  issues  relevant  to  the  prevention,  eradication, 
and  control  of  invasive  species,  shall  provide  the  Council  with  annual 
information on actions taken that implement these duties and identify barriers 
to advancing priority actions. 

(e)  To  the  extent  practicable,  Federal  agencies  shall  also  expand  the  use 
of  new  and  existing  technologies  and  practices;  develop,  share,  and  utilize 
similar  metrics  and  standards,  methodologies,  and  databases  and,  where 
relevant,  platforms  for  monitoring  invasive  species;  and,  facilitate  the  inter-
operability of information systems, open data, data analytics, predictive mod-
eling,  and  data  reporting  necessary  to  inform  timely,  science-based  decision 
making. 
Sec. 4. Emerging Priorities. Federal agencies that are members of the Council 
and Federal interagency bodies working on issues relevant to the prevention, 
eradication,  and  control  of  invasive  species  shall  take  emerging  priorities 
into consideration, including: 

(a)  Federal  agencies  shall  consider  the  potential  public  health  and  safety 
impacts  of  invasive  species,  especially  those  species  that  are  vectors,  res-
ervoirs,  and  causative  agents  of  disease.  The  Department  of  Health  and 
Human  Services,  in  coordination  and  consultation  with  relevant  agencies 
as  appropriate,  shall  within  1  year  of  this  order,  and  as  requested  by  the 
Council  thereafter,  provide  the  Office  of  Science  and  Technology  Policy 
and  the  Council  a  report  on  public  health  impacts  associated  with  invasive 
species.  That  report  shall  describe  the  disease,  injury,  immunologic,  and 
safety  impacts  associated  with  invasive  species,  including  any  direct  and 
indirect impacts on low-income, minority, and tribal communities. 

(b)  Federal  agencies  shall  consider  the  impacts  of  climate  change  when 
working  on  issues  relevant  to  the  prevention,  eradication,  and  control  of 
invasive  species,  including  in  research  and  monitoring  efforts,  and  integrate 
invasive  species  into  Federal  climate  change  coordinating  frameworks  and 
initiatives. 

(c)  Federal  agencies  shall  consider  opportunities  to  apply  innovative 
science  and  technology  when  addressing  the  duties  identified  in  section

12793 

Notice  of  March  9,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Iran 

On  March  15,  1995,  by  Executive  Order  12957,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency with respect to Iran, pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706), to deal with the unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy 
of the United States constituted by the actions and policies of the Government 
of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order 12959, impos-
ing  comprehensive  sanctions  on  Iran  to  further  respond  to  this  threat.  On 
August  19,  1997,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13059,  consolidating 
and  clarifying  the  previous  orders.  I  took  additional  steps  pursuant  to  this 
national emergency in Executive Order 13553 of September 28, 2010, Execu-
tive  Order  13574  of  May  23,  2011,  Executive  Order  13590  of  November 
20, 2011, Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012, Executive Order 13606 
of  April  22,  2012,  Executive  Order  13608  of  May  1,  2012,  Executive  Order 
13622  of  July  30,  2012,  Executive  Order  13628  of  October  9,  2012,  and 
Executive Order 13645 of June 3, 2013. 
On  July  14,  2015,  the  P5+1  (China,  France,  Germany,  Russia,  the  United 
Kingdom,  and  the  United  States),  the  European  Union,  and  Iran  reached 
a  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action  (JCPOA)  to  ensure  that  Iran’s  nuclear 
program  is  and  will  remain  exclusively  peaceful.  January  16,  2016,  marked 
Implementation Day under the JCPOA, when the International Atomic Energy 
Agency issued a report verifying that Iran had completed key nuclear-related 
steps  as  specified  in  the  JCPOA,  and  the  Secretary  of  State  confirmed  the 
report’s findings. As a result, the United States lifted nuclear-related sanctions 
on  Iran  consistent  with  its  commitments  under  the  JCPOA,  including  the 
termination  of  a  number  of  Executive  Orders  that  were  issued  pursuant 
to  this  national  emergency.  Though  the  lifting  of  nuclear-related  sanctions 
constitutes a significant change in our sanctions posture, non-nuclear related 
sanctions remain in place. 
Despite  the  historic  deal  to  ensure  the  exclusively  peaceful  nature  of  Iran’s 
nuclear  program,  certain  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  Iran 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the 
national  emergency  declared  on  March  15,  1995,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  March  15,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of 
the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1 
year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  Iran  declared  in  Executive 
Order  12957.  The  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  12957  constitutes 
an emergency separate from that declared on November 14, 1979, by Execu-
tive  Order  12170.  This  renewal,  therefore,  is  distinct  from  the  emergency 
renewal of November 2015.

Notice  of  November  3,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Iran 

On  November  14,  1979,  by  Executive  Order  12170,  the  President  declared 
a national emergency with respect to Iran and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  took  related  steps 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the situation 
in  Iran.  Our  relations  with  Iran  have  not  yet  returned  to  normal,  and  the 
process  of  implementing  the  agreements  with  Iran,  dated  January  19,  1981, 
is  still  under  way.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on 
November  14,  1979,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  November  14,  2016. 
Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies 
Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency 
with respect to Iran declared in Executive Order 12170. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Revocation  of  Executive  Orders  13574,  13590,  13622,  and 
13645  With  Respect  to  Iran,  Amendment  of  Executive  Order

side  the  Scope  of  U.S.  Commitments  Under  the  Joint  Com-
prehensive  Plan  of  Action  of  July  14,  2015 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.)  (IEEPA),  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1601  et  seq.)  (NEA),  the  Iran  Sanctions  Act  of  1996 
(Public  Law  104–172)  (50  U.S.C.  1701  note),  the  Comprehensive  Iran  Sanc-
tions,  Accountability,  and  Divestment  Act  of  2010  (Public  Law  111–195) 
(22  U.S.C.  8501  et  seq.),  the  Iran  Threat  Reduction  and  Syria  Human  Rights 
Act  of  2012  (Public  Law  112–158),  the  Iran  Freedom  and  Counter-Prolifera-
tion  Act  of  2012  (subtitle  D  of  title  XII  of  Public  Law  112–239)  (22  U.S.C.

of  1952  (8  U.S.C.  1182(f)),  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States  Code, 
I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  have  deter-
mined  that  Iran’s  implementation  of  the  nuclear-related  measures  specified 
in  sections  15.1–15.11  of  Annex  V  of  the  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of 
Action of July 14, 2015 (JCPOA) between the P5+1 (China, France, Germany, 
the  Russian  Federation,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  United  States),  the 
European  Union,  and  Iran,  as  verified  by  the  International  Atomic  Energy 
Agency,  marks  a  fundamental  shift  in  circumstances  with  respect  to  Iran’s 
nuclear  program.  In  order  to  give  effect  to  the  United  States  commitments 
with  respect  to  sanctions  described  in  section  4  of  Annex  II  and  section 
17.4  of  Annex  V  of  the  JCPOA,  I  am  revoking  Executive  Orders  13574 
of  May  23,  2011,  13590  of  November  20,  2011,  13622  of  July  30,  2012, 
and 13645 of June 3, 2013, and amending Executive Order 13628 of October 
9,  2012,  by  revoking  sections  5  through  7  and  section  15.  In  addition, 
in  section  3  of  this  order,  I  am  taking  steps  with  respect  to  the  national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 12957 of March 15, 1995, to provide 
implementation  authorities  for  aspects  of  certain  statutory  sanctions  that 
are outside the scope of the U.S. commitment to lift nuclear-related sanctions 
under the JCPOA. 
This  action  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  limit  the  applicability  of 
waiver  determinations  or  any  renewals  thereof  issued  by  the  Secretary  of 
State,  or  licenses  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  to  give  effect 
to sanctions commitments described in sections 17.1–17.3 and 17.5 of Annex 
V  of  the  JCPOA,  or  otherwise  affect  the  national  emergency  declared  in 
Executive Order 12957, which shall remain in place, or any Executive Order 
issued in furtherance of that national emergency other than Executive Orders 
13574, 13590, 13622, 13628, and 13645. 
I hereby order: 
Section  1.  Revocation  of  Executive  Orders.  The  following  Executive  Orders 
are revoked: 

(a)  Executive  Order  13574  of  May  23,  2011  (Authorizing  the  Implementa-

case  as  informed  by  section  1253(c)(2)  of  IFCA)  for  engaging  in  transactions

Sec.  10.  Notice.  For  those  persons  whose  property  and  interests  in  property 
are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence

or  other  assets  instantaneously,  prior  notice  to  such  persons  of  measures 
to  be  taken  pursuant  to  this  order  would  render  those  measures  ineffectual. 
I  therefore  determine  that  for  these  measures  to  be  effective  in  addressing 
the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  12957,  there  need  be 
no  prior  notice  of  an  action  taken  pursuant  to  subsection  3(a)(ii),  3(b)(i)(D),

Notice  of  May  18,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Stabilization  of  Iraq 

On  May  22,  2003,  by  Executive  Order  13303,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Pow-
ers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  posed 
by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and mainte-
nance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. 

The obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and mainte-
nance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to pose an unusual 
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the 
United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order  13303,  as  modified  in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps 
taken  in  Executive  Order  13315  of  August  28,  2003,  Executive  Order  13350 
of  July  29,  2004,  Executive  Order  13364  of  November  29,  2004,  Executive 
Order  13438  of  July  17,  2007,  and  Executive  Order  13668  of  May  27,  2014, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  May  22,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the 
stabilization of Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9476  of  August  24,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  National 
Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  north  central  Maine  lies  an  area  of  the  North  Woods  known  in  recent 
years  as  the  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  Recreation  Area  (Katahdin  Woods 
and  Waters),  approximately  87,500  acres  within  a  larger  landscape  already 
conserved  by  public  and  private  efforts  starting  a  century  ago.  Katahdin 
Woods  and  Waters  contains  a  significant  piece  of  this  extraordinary  natural 
and  cultural  landscape:  the  mountains,  woods,  and  waters  east  of  Baxter 
State  Park  (home  of  Mount  Katahdin,  the  northern  terminus  of  the  Appa-
lachian  Trail),  where  the  East  Branch  of  the  Penobscot  River  and  its  tribu-
taries, including the Wassataquoik Stream and the Seboeis River, run freely. 
Since the glaciers retreated 12,000 years ago, these waterways and associated 
resources—the  scenery,  geology,  flora  and  fauna,  night  skies,  and  more— 
have  attracted  people  to  this  area.  Native  Americans  still  cherish  these 
resources.  Lumberjacks,  river  drivers,  and  timber  owners  have  earned  their 
livings  here.  Artists,  authors,  scientists,  conservationists,  recreationists,  and 
others have drawn knowledge and inspiration from this landscape. 
Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  contains  objects  of  significant  scientific  and 
historic  interest.  For  some  11,000  years,  Native  peoples  have  inhabited  the 
area,  depending  on  its  waterways  and  woods  for  sustenance.  They  traveled 
during  the  year  from  the  upper  reaches  of  the  East  Branch  of  the  Penobscot 
River and its tributaries to coastal destinations like Frenchman and Penobscot 
Bays. Native peoples have traditionally used the rivers as a vast transportation 
network,  seasonally  searching  for  food,  furs,  medicines,  and  many  other 
resources. Based on the results of archeological research performed in nearby 
areas,  researchers  believe  that  much  of  the  archeological  record  of  this 
long  Native  American  presence  in  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  remains 
to be discovered, creating significant opportunity for scientific investigation. 
What  is  known  is  that  the  Wabanaki  people,  in  particular  the  Penobscot 
Indian  Nation,  consider  the  Penobscot  River  (including  the  East  Branch 
watershed) a centerpiece of their culture and spiritual values. 
The  first  documented  Euro-American  exploration  of  the  Katahdin  region 
dates  to  a  1793  survey  commissioned  by  the  Commonwealth  of  Massachu-
setts.  After  Maine  achieved  statehood  in  1820,  Major  Joseph  Treat,  guided 
by  John  Neptune  of  the  Penobscot  Tribe,  produced  the  first  detailed  maps 
of  the  region.  The  Maine  Boundary  Commission  authorized  a  survey  of 
the  new  State  in  1825,  for  which  surveyor  Joseph  C.  Norris,  Sr.,  and  his 
son established the ‘‘Monument Line,’’ which runs through Katahdin Woods 
and Waters and serves as the State’s east-west baseline from which township 
boundaries are drawn. 
By  the  early  19th  century  until  the  late  20th  century,  logging  was  a  way 
of  life  throughout  the  area,  as  exemplified  by  the  history  of  logging  along 
the  Wassataquoik  Stream.  To  access  the  upstream  forests,  a  tote  road  was 
built  on  the  Wassataquoik’s  north  bank  around  1841;  traces  of  the  old 
road  can  still  be  seen  in  places.  The  earliest  loggers  felled  enormous  white 
pines  and  then  ‘‘drove’’  them  down  the  tumultuous  stream.  Beginning  in 
the  1880s,  after  the  choice  pines  were  gone,  the  loggers  switched  to  spruce

long  logs,  and  built  camps,  depots,  and  many  dams  on  the  Wassataquoik 
to  control  its  flow  for  the  log  drives.  Remnants  of  the  Dacey  and  Robar 
Dams have been found, and discovery of more logging remnants and historic 
artifacts  is  likely.  Log  driving  was  dangerous,  and  many  men  died  on  the 
river and were buried nearby. A large fire in 1884 damaged logging operations 
on  the  Wassataquoik,  and  an  even  larger  fire  in  1903  put  an  end  to  the 
long  log  operations.  Pulpwood  operations  resumed  in  1910  but  ceased  in 
1915. Other streams, like Sandy Stream, have similar logging histories. 
The  East  Branch  of  the  Penobscot  River  and  its  major  tributaries  served 
as  a  thoroughfare  for  huge  log  drives  headed  toward  Bangor.  Log  drives 
ended (based primarily on environmental concerns) in the 1970s, after which 
the  timber  companies  relied  on  trucking  and  a  network  of  private  roads 
they started to build in the 1950s. 
In the 1800s, the infrastructure that developed to support the logging industry 
also  drew  hunters,  anglers,  and  hikers  to  the  area.  In  the  1830s,  within 
2  miles  of  one  another  on  the  eastern  side  of  the  Penobscot  East  Branch, 
William  Hunt  and  Hiram  Dacey  established  farms  to  serve  loggers,  which 
soon also served recreationists, scientists, and others who wanted to explore 
the  Katahdin  region  or  climb  its  mountains.  Just  across  the  East  Branch 
from the Hunt and Dacey Farms (the latter now the site of Lunksoos Camps) 
lies the entrance to the Wassataquoik Stream. In 1848, the Reverend Marcus 
Keep  established  what  is  still  called  Keep  Path,  running  along  the 
Wassataquoik  to  Katahdin  Lake  and  on  to  Mount  Katahdin.  From  that  time 
until  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  the  favored  entryway  to  the  Katahdin 
region  started  on  the  east  side  of  Mount  Katahdin  with  a  visit  to  Hunt 
or  Dacey  Farm,  then  crossed  the  East  Branch  and  ascended  the  valley  of 
the Wassataquoik Stream. 
Henry  David  Thoreau—who  made  the  ‘‘Maine  Woods’’  famous  through  his 
publications—approached  from  the  headwaters  of  the  East  Branch  to  the 
north.  With  his  Penobscot  guide  Joe  Polis  and  companion  Edward  Hoar 
in  1857,  on  his  last  and  longest  trip  to  the  area,  he  paddled  past  Dacey 
Farm  with  just  a  brief  stop  at  Hunt  Farm.  He  wrote  about  his  two  nights 
in  the  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  area—the  first  at  what  he  named  the 
‘‘Checkerberry-tea  camp,’’  near  the  oxbow  just  upriver  from  Stair  Falls,  and 
the  second  on  the  river  between  Dacey  and  Hunt  Farms  where  he  drank 
hemlock tea. 
During  his  1879  Maine  trip  on  which  he  summited  Mount  Katahdin,  Theo-
dore  Roosevelt  followed  the  route  across  the  East  Branch  and  up  the 
Wassataquoik.  As  Roosevelt  later  recalled,  he  lost  one  of  his  hiking  boots 
crossing  the  Wassataquoik  but,  undaunted,  completed  the  challenging  trek 
in  moccasins.  Many  including  Roosevelt  himself  have  observed  that  his 
several  trips  to  the  Katahdin  region  in  the  late  1870s  had  a  significant 
impact  on  his  life,  as  he  overcame  longstanding  health  problems,  gained 
strength  and  stamina,  experienced  the  wonder  of  nature  and  the  desire 
to conserve it, and made friends for life from the Maine Woods. 
Native  Mainer  Percival  P.  Baxter,  too,  followed  this  route  on  the  1920 
trip  that  solidified  his  determination  to  create  a  large  park  from  this  land-
scape.  Burton  Howe,  a  Patten  lumberman,  organized  this  trip  of  Maine 
notables,  who  stayed  at  Lunksoos  Camps  before  their  ascent  via  the  estab-
lished  route.  As  a  State  representative,  senator,  and  governor,  Baxter  had 
proposed  legislation  to  create  a  Mount  Katahdin  park  in  commemoration 
of the State’s centennial, and the 1920 trip cemented his profound apprecia-
tion  of  the  landscape.  Spurned  by  the  Maine  legislature,  Baxter  devoted 
his  life  to  acquiring  28  parcels  of  land,  largely  from  timber  companies 
who  had  heavily  logged  them,  and  donated  them  to  the  State  with  manage-
ment  instructions  and  an  endowment,  resulting  in  the  establishment  of 
Baxter State Park. 
Artists  and  photographers  have  left  indelible  images  of  their  time  spent 
in  the  area.  In  1832,  John  James  Audubon  canoed  the  East  Branch  and 
sketched  natural  features  for  his  masterpiece  Birds  of  America.  Frederic

Edwin Church, the preeminent landscape artist of the Hudson River School, 
first  visited  the  area  in  the  1850s,  and  in  1877  invited  his  landscape- 
painter  colleagues  to  join  him  on  a  well-publicized  expedition  from  Hunt 
Farm up the Wassataquoik Stream to capture varied views of Mount Katahdin 
and  environs.  In  the  early  1900s,  George  H.  Hallowell  painted  and  photo-
graphed  the  log  drives  on  the  Wassataquoik  Stream,  and  Carl  Sprinchorn 
painted logging activities on the Seboeis River. 
Geologists were among the earliest scientists to visit the area. While surveys 
were  done  in  the  1800s,  in-depth  geological  research  and  mapping  of  the 
area did not begin until the 1950s. These mid-20th century geologists found 
bedrock  spanning  over  150  million  years  of  the  Paleozoic  era,  revealing 
a remarkably complete exposure of Paleozoic rock strata with well-preserved 
fossils.  The  lands  west  of  the  Penobscot  East  Branch  are  dominated  by 
volcanic and granitic rock from the Devonian period, mostly Katahdin Granite 
but  also  Traveler  Rhyolite,  a  light-colored  volcanic  rock  that  is  similar  in 
composition  to  granite.  The  oldest  rock  in  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters, 
a light greenish-gray quartzite interlayered with slate from the early Cambrian 
period  (over  500  million  years  ago),  can  be  observed  along  the  riverbank 
of  the  Penobscot  East  Branch  for  over  1,000  feet  at  the  Grand  Pitch  (a 
river  rapid).  This  rock  is  part  of  the  Weeksboro-Lunksoos  Lake  anticline, 
a  broad  upward  fold  of  rocks  originally  deposited  horizontally,  which  is 
evidence  of  mountain-building  tectonics.  The  fold  continues  north  along 
the  river  and  then  turns  northeast  toward  Shin  Pond,  exposing  successive 
bands  of  younger  Paleozoic  rock  of  both  volcanic  and  sedimentary  origin 
on either side of the structure. 
Various  formations  in  the  area  provide  striking  visual  evidence  of  marine 
waters  in  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  during  the  geologic  periods  that 
immediately followed the Cambrian period. For example, Owen Brook lime-
stone,  an  outcrop  of  calcareous  bedrock  west  of  the  Penobscot  East  Branch 
containing  fossil  brachiopods,  is  of  coral  reef  origin.  Pillow  lavas,  such 
as  those  near  the  summit  of  Lunksoos  Mountain,  were  produced  by  under-
water eruptions. Haskell Rock, the 20-foot-tall pillar in the midst of a Penob-
scot  East  Branch  rapid,  is  conglomerate  bedrock  that  suggests  a  time  of 
dynamic transition from volcanic islands to an ocean with underwater sedi-
mentation.  This  conglomerate,  deposited  about  450  million  years  ago,  con-
tains volcanic and sedimentary stones of various sizes, and occurs in outcrops 
and boulders in several locations. 
The  area’s  geology  also  provides  prominent  evidence  of  large  and  powerful 
earth-changing  events.  During  the  Paleozoic  era  (541  to  252  million  years 
ago),  mountain-building  events  contributed  to  the  rise  of  the  primordial 
Appalachian  Mountain  range  and  the  amalgamation  of  the  supercontinent 
Pangaea.  Following  the  last  mountain-building  event,  significant  erosion 
reshaped  the  topography,  helping  to  expose  the  cores  of  volcanoes,  the 
Katahdin pluton, and the structure of the previous mountain-building events. 
About  200  million  years  ago,  Pangaea  began  splitting  apart  as  the  Atlantic 
Ocean  appeared  and  North  America,  Europe,  and  Africa  formed.  Today, 
the  International  Appalachian  Trail,  a  long-distance  hiking  trail,  seeks  to 
follow  the  ancestral  Appalachian-Caledonian  Mountains  on  both  sides  of 
the Atlantic, starting at Katahdin Lake in Baxter State Park near the northern 
end  of  the  domestic  Appalachian  Trail,  traversing  Katahdin  Woods  and 
Waters  for  about  30  miles,  and  proceeding  through  Canada  for  resumption 
across the Atlantic. 
In  more  recent  geological  history,  during  the  approximately  2.5  million 
year-long  Pleistocene  epoch  that  ended  approximately  12,000  years  ago, 
repeated  glaciations  covered  the  region,  eroding  bedrock  and  shaping  the 
modern  landscape.  Glacial  till  from  the  most  recent  glaciations  underlies 
much  of  the  area’s  soil,  moraines  occur  in  several  locations,  and  glacial 
erratics  are  common.  Prominent  eskers—long,  snaking  ridges  of  sand  and 
gravel  deposited  by  glacial  meltwater—occur  along  most  of  the  Penobscot 
East Branch and the Wassataquoik Stream. Glacial landforms, glacial scoured

bedrock, and the lake sediments in the area, deposited only since the retreat 
of  the  last  glaciers,  record  a  history  of  intense  climate  change  that  gave 
rise to the modern topography of the area. 
This  post-glacial  topography  is  studded  with  attractive  small  mountains, 
including  some  like  Deasey,  Lunksoos,  and  Barnard,  that  offer  spectacular 
views of Mount Katahdin. Katahdin Woods and Waters abuts much of Baxter 
State Park’s eastern boundary, extending the conservation landscape through 
shared  mountains,  streams,  corridors  for  plants  and  animals,  and  other  nat-
ural systems. 
Among  the  defining  natural  features  of  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  is 
the East Branch of the Penobscot River system, including its major tributaries, 
the Seboeis River and the Wassataquoik Stream, and many smaller tributaries. 
Known as one of the least developed watersheds in the northeastern United 
States, the Penobscot East Branch River system has a stunning concentration 
of  hydrological  features  in  addition  to  its  significant  geology  and  ecology. 
From  the  northern  boundary  of  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters,  the  main 
stem  of  the  East  Branch  drops  over  200  feet  in  about  10  miles  through 
a  series  of  rapids  and  waterfalls—including  Stair  Falls,  Haskell  Rock  Pitch, 
Pond Pitch, Grand Pitch, the Hulling Machine, and Bowlin Falls. 
After Bowlin Brook, the main stem declines more gently south toward Whet-
stone Falls and below, embroidered with many side channels and associated 
floodplain  forests  and  open  streamshores.  Of  the  two  major  tributaries,  the 
Seboeis  River  flows  in  from  the  east,  and  the  Wassataquoik  Stream  from 
the  west,  the  latter  dropping  over  500  feet  in  its  approximately  14-mile 
wild  run  from  the  border  of  Baxter  State  Park  to  its  confluence  with  the 
Penobscot East Branch main stem. 
The  extraordinary  significance  of  the  Penobscot  East  Branch  River  system 
has  long  been  recognized.  A  1977  Department  of  the  Interior  study  deter-
mined  that  the  East  Branch  of  the  Penobscot  River,  including  the 
Wassataquoik Stream, qualifies for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic 
Rivers  System  based  on  its  outstandingly  remarkable  values,  and  a  1982 
Federal-State  study  of  rivers  in  Maine  determined  that  the  Penobscot  East 
Branch  River  System,  including  both  the  Wassataquoik  Stream  and  the 
Seboeis  River,  ranks  in  the  highest  category  of  natural  and  recreational 
rivers and possesses nationally significant resource values. 
In recent years, a multi-party public-private project has taken steps to recon-
nect  the  Penobscot  River  with  the  sea  through  the  removal  and  retrofitting 
of  downstream  dams.  This  river  restoration  will  likely  further  enhance  the 
integrity of the Penobscot East Branch river system, and provide opportunities 
for scientific study of the effects of the restoration on upstream areas within 
Katahdin Woods and Waters. It will also allow federally endangered Atlantic 
salmon  to  return  to  the  upper  reaches  of  the  river  known  in  the  Penobscot 
language  as  ‘‘Wassetegweweck,’’  or  ‘‘the  place  where  they  spear  fish.’’  The 
return  of  ocean-run  Atlantic  salmon  to  this  watershed  would  complement 
the  exceptional  native  brook  trout  fishery  for  which  Katahdin  Woods  and 
Waters is known today. 
Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters  possesses  significant  biodiversity.  Spanning 
three  ecoregions,  it  displays  the  transition  between  northern  boreal  and 
southern  broadleaf  deciduous  forests,  providing  a  unique  and  important 
opportunity for scientific investigation of the effects of climate change across 
ecotones.  The  forests  include  mixed  hardwoods  like  sugar  maple,  beech, 
and  yellow  birch;  mixed  forests  with  hardwoods,  hemlock,  and  white  pine; 
and  spruce-fir  forests  with  balsam  fir,  red  spruce,  and  birches.  In  wetland 
areas, black spruce, white spruce, red maple, and tamarack dominate. 
Although  significant  portions  of  the  area  have  been  logged  in  recent  years, 
the  regenerating  forests  retain  connectivity  and  provide  significant  biodiver-
sity  among  plant  and  animal  communities,  enhancing  their  ecological  resil-
ience. With the complex matrix of microclimates represented, the area likely 
contains  the  attributes  needed  to  sustain  natural  ecological  function  in  the

face  of  climate  change,  and  provide  natural  strongholds  for  species  into 
the  future.  These  forests  also  afford  connections  and  scientific  comparisons 
with  the  forests  on  adjacent  State  land,  including  Baxter  State  Park,  which 
was  logged  heavily  before  its  parcel-by-parcel  purchase  by  former  Governor 
Percival Baxter between 1931 and 1963. 
Of  particular  scientific  significance  are  the  number  and  quality  of  small 
and  medium-sized  patch  ecosystems  throughout  the  area,  tending  to  occur 
in  less  common  topography  that  is  often  relatively  remote  or  inaccessible. 
Hilltops and barrens often protect rare flora and fauna, such as the blueberry- 
lichen  barren  and  associated  spruce-heath  barren  found  between  Robar  and 
Eastern  Brooks,  and  the  three-toothed  cinquefoil-blueberry  low  summit  bald 
atop  Lunksoos  Mountain,  where  rattlesnake  hawkweed  can  be  found.  Cliffs 
and  steep  slopes,  like  those  present  along  the  ridge  from  Deasey  Mountain 
to  Little  Spring  Brook  Mountain  and  on  the  eastern  sides  of  Billfish  and 
Traveler  Mountains,  harbor  exemplary  rock  outcrop  ecosystems  that  often 
include  flora  of  special  interest,  such  as  fragrant  cliff  wood-fern  and  purple 
clematis.  Ravines  and  coves  can  support  enriched  forests  like  the  maple- 
basswood-ash community found below the eastern cliffs of Lunksoos Moun-
tain,  with  trees  over  250  years  old  and  associated  rare  plants  including 
squirrel-corn. The Appalachian-Acadian rivershore ecosystems of the Penob-
scot  East  Branch  and  its  two  major  tributaries  are  considered  exemplary 
in  Maine,  with  occurrences  of  beautiful  silver  maple  floodplain  forest  and 
hardwood  river  terrace  forest—rare  and  imperiled  natural  communities,  re-
spectively,  in  the  State.  A  nationally  significant  diversity  of  high  quality 
wetlands  and  wet  basins  occurs  throughout  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters, 
including smaller streams and brooks, ponds, swamps, bogs, and fens. Patch 
forests  of  various  types  also  occur  throughout  the  area,  such  as  a  red- 
pine  woodland  forest  on  small  hills  and  ridges  amid  the  large  Mud  Brook 
Flowage wetland in the southwestern section. 
The  expanse  of  Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters,  augmented  by  its  location 
next  to  other  large  conservation  properties  including  Baxter  State  Park  and 
additional  State  reservations,  supports  many  wide-ranging  wildlife  species 
including  ruffed  grouse,  moose,  black  bear,  white-tailed  deer,  snowshoe 
hare, American marten, bobcat, bald eagle, northern goshawk, and the feder-
ally  threatened  Canada  lynx.  Seventy-eight  bird  species  are  known  to  breed 
in  the  area,  and  many  more  bird  species  use  it.  Visitation  and  study  of 
the  area  have  been  limited  to  date,  as  compared  with  other  areas  like 
Baxter  State  Park,  and  many  more  species  of  birds  and  other  wildlife  may 
be present. 
Certain  wildlife  species  are  known  to  occur  in  specific  patch  ecosystems 
in  the  area,  such  as  the  short-eared  owl  in  hilltops  and  barrens,  and  the 
silver-haired  bat  and  the  wood  turtle  in  floodplain  forests.  Mussels  such 
as  the  tidewater  mucket  and  yellow  lampmussel  live  in  some  of  the  brooks 
and streams, and rare invertebrates like the copper butterfly, pygmy snaketail 
dragonfly,  Tomah  mayfly,  and  Roaring  Brook  mayfly  inhabit  some  of  its 
bogs and fens. 
Katahdin  Woods  and  Waters’s  daytime  scenery  is  awe-inspiring,  from  the 
breadth of its mountain-studded landscape, to the channels of its free-flowing 
streams  with  their  rapids,  falls,  and  quiet  water,  to  its  vantages  for  viewing 
the  Mount  Katahdin  massif,  the  ‘‘greatest  mountain.’’  The  area’s  night  skies 
rival this experience, glittering with stars and planets and occasional displays 
of  the  aurora  borealis,  in  this  area  of  the  country  known  for  its  dark  sky. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected;

Notice  of  July  27,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Leb-
anon 

On  August  1,  2007,  by  Executive  Order  13441,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  with  respect  to  Lebanon  pursuant  to  the  International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions  of  certain  persons  to  under-
mine  Lebanon’s  legitimate  and  democratically  elected  government  or  demo-
cratic  institutions;  to  contribute  to  the  deliberate  breakdown  in  the  rule 
of  law  in  Lebanon,  including  through  politically  motivated  violence  and 
intimidation;  to  reassert  Syrian  control  or  contribute  to  Syrian  interference 
in  Lebanon;  or  to  infringe  upon  or  undermine  Lebanese  sovereignty.  Such 
actions  contribute  to  political  and  economic  instability  in  that  country  and 
the region. 

Certain  ongoing  activities,  such  as  continuing  arms  transfers  to  Hizballah 
that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve to undermine 
Lebanese  sovereignty,  contribute  to  political  and  economic  instability  in 
Lebanon,  and  continue  to  constitute  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  August  1,  2016.  In  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency  with  respect  to  Lebanon  declared  in  Executive  Order  13441. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  February  22,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Libya 

On  February  25,  2011,  by  Executive  Order  13566,  I  declared  a  national 
emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by  the  actions  of  Colonel  Muammar  Qadhafi,  his  government,  and  close 
associates, who took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including 
by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed 
civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would 
be  misappropriated  by  Qadhafi,  members  of  his  government,  members  of 
his  family,  or  his  close  associates  if  those  assets  were  not  protected.  The 
foregoing  circumstances,  the  prolonged  attacks,  and  the  increased  numbers 
of  Libyans  seeking  refuge  in  other  countries  caused  a  deterioration  in  the 
security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability. 

The  situation  in  Libya  continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States, 
and  we  need  to  protect  against  the  diversion  of  assets  or  other  abuse  by 
certain members of Qadhafi’s family and other former regime officials. 

For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  February  25,  2011, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  February  25,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order 13566. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Memorandum  of  March  21,  2016 

Building  National  Capabilities  for  Long-Term  Drought  Resil-
ience 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  Our  Nation  must  sustain  and  expand  efforts  to  reduce 
the  vulnerability  of  communities  to  the  impacts  of  drought.  Every  year, 
drought  affects  millions  of  Americans  and  poses  a  serious  and  growing 
threat  to  the  security  and  economies  of  communities  nationwide.  Drought 
presents  challenges  to  the  viability  of  agricultural  production  and  to  the 
quantity and quality of drinking water supplies that communities and indus-
tries depend upon. Drought jeopardizes the integrity of critical infrastructure, 
causes  extensive  economic  and  health  impacts,  harms  ecosystems,  and  in-
creases  energy  costs.  In  responding  to  and  recovering  from  past  droughts, 
we  have  learned  that  focused  collaboration  across  all  levels  of  government 
and the private sector is critical to enable productive and workable solutions 
to build regional resilience to drought. 
Among  other  actions,  this  memorandum  institutionalizes  the  National 
Drought  Resilience  Partnership  (NDRP),  which  builds  upon  the  National 
Integrated  Drought  Information  System,  an  interagency  program  led  by  the 
Department of Commerce. The NDRP was outlined in the President’s Climate 
Action  Plan  to  better  coordinate  Federal  support  for  drought-related  efforts, 
help communities reduce the impact of current drought events, and prepare 
for  future  droughts.  In  sustaining  this  focused  collaboration,  the  NDRP  will 
provide the Federal Government with a lasting platform that enables locally 
and  regionally  driven  priorities  and  needs  to  guide  coordinated  Federal 
activities. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  Federal  Government  to  coordinate 
and  use  applicable  Federal  investments,  assets,  and  expertise  to  promote 
drought  resilience  and  complement  drought  preparedness,  planning,  and 
implementation  efforts  of  State,  regional,  tribal,  and  local  institutions.  In 
addition, where appropriate, the Federal Government shall seek partnerships 
with such institutions and the private sector in order to increase and diversify 
our  Nation’s  water  resources  through  the  development  and  deployment  of 
new technologies and improved access to alternative water supplies. Agencies 
shall  also  work  with  State,  regional,  tribal,  and  local  institutions  to  support 
their  efforts  to  maintain  and  enhance  the  long-term  health  and  resilience 
of  working  lands  and  ecosystems.  In  carrying  out  this  memorandum,  execu-
tive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies)  shall  continue  to  recognize  the 
primacy  of  States,  regions,  tribes,  and  local  water  users  in  building  their 
resilience to drought. 
Sec.  3.  Drought  Resilience  Goals.  (a)  The  heads  of  agencies  shall,  to  the 
extent  permitted  by  law  and  to  the  maximum  extent  possible,  carry  out 
the  policy  described  in  section  2  of  this  memorandum  by  implementing 
policies and taking actions to achieve the following drought resilience goals: 
(i) Data Collection and Integration. Agencies shall share data and informa-
tion  related  to  drought,  water  use,  and  water  availability,  including  data 
on  snowpack,  groundwater,  stream  flow,  and  soil  moisture  with  State,

regional, tribal, and local officials to strengthen decisionmaking to support 
more adaptive responses to drought and drought risk. 
(ii)  Communicating  Drought  Risk  to  Critical  Infrastructure.  Agencies  shall 
communicate  with  State,  regional,  tribal,  local,  and  critical  infrastructure 
officials,  targeted  information  about  drought  risks,  including  specific  risks 
to critical infrastructure. 
(iii)  Drought  Planning  and  Capacity  Building.  Agencies  shall  assist  State,

(iv)  Coordination  of  Federal  Drought  Activity.  Agencies  shall  improve 
the  coordination  and  integration  of  drought-related  activities  to  enhance 
the collective benefits of Federal programs and investments. 
(v)  Market-Based  Approaches  for  Infrastructure  and  Efficiency.  Agencies 
shall  support  the  advancement  of  innovative  investment  models  and  mar-
ket-based  approaches  to  increase  resilience,  flexibility,  and  efficiency  of 
water use and water supply systems. 
(vi) Innovative Water Use, Efficiency, and Technology. Agencies shall sup-
port  efforts  to  conserve  and  make  efficient  use  of  water  by  carrying  out 
relevant research, innovation, and international engagements. 
(b)  The  NDRP,  as  described  in  section  5  of  this  memorandum,  shall 
facilitate,  coordinate,  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  actions  con-
ducted to achieve these goals. 
Sec.  4.  Drought  Resilience  Actions.  In  furtherance  of  the  policies  and  goals 
described  in  this  memorandum,  I  hereby  direct  agencies  to  take,  subject 
to  the  availability  of  appropriations,  by  December  31,  2016,  the  following 
actions: 

(a) Data Collection and Integration. 
(i) The heads of agencies participating in the NDRP shall: 

(A)  improve  the  integration  of  all  relevant  drought-related  data  and 
information,  and  facilitate  the  use  of  such  data,  in  coordination  with 
the  National  Integrated  Drought  Information  System,  by  State,  regional, 
tribal,  and  local  officials  in  drought  planning  and  decisionmaking;  and 
(B)  identify  and  use  data  formats  that  will  allow  these  datasets  to  be 

incorporated into existing geospatial data platforms. 
(ii) The Secretaries of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, and the Director 
of the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall coordinate the imple-
mentation of the activities described in section 4(a)(i) of this memorandum.

(i) The heads of agencies participating in the NDRP shall: 

(A) provide technical and scientific information to State, regional, tribal, 
and  local  officials  concerning  the  integration  of  drought  planning,  hazard 
mitigation, and preparedness planning; and 

(B)  ensure  that  local  and  regional  officials  are  aware  of  drought-related 
planning  activities  and  similar  initiatives  occurring  in  their  region,  which 
will  avoid  duplication  of  effort  and  prompt  peer-to-peer  collaboration. 
(ii)  The  Secretaries  of  the  Interior,  Agriculture,  Commerce,  and  Homeland 
Security  shall  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  activities  described 
in section 4(b)(i) of this memorandum.

tribal, and local drought stakeholders. 

(b)  Regional  Engagement  Coordination.  In  regions  where  complementary 
drought  resilience  activities  are  implemented  by  multiple  Federal  agencies, 
those  agencies  shall  coordinate  regional  outreach  strategies.  Further,  these

incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating 
impact  on  security,  national  economic  security,  national  public  health  or 
safety, or any combination of those matters. 

(c)  ‘‘Drought’’  has  the  meaning  provided  in  section  2(1)  of  the  National 
Integrated  Drought  Information  System  Act  of  2006  (15  U.S.C.  313d  note), 
namely,  a  deficiency  in  precipitation  that  leads  to  a  deficiency  in  surface 
or  subsurface  water  supplies  (including  rivers,  streams,  wetlands,  ground-
water,  soil  moisture,  reservoir  supplies,  lake  levels,  and  snow  pack);  and

relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(c)  This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right 
or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by 
any  party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,

Notice  of  January  20,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Ter-
rorists  Who  Threaten  To  Disrupt  the  Middle  East  Peace  Proc-
ess 

On  January  23,  1995,  by  Executive  Order  12947,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United 
States  constituted  by  grave  acts  of  violence  committed  by  foreign  terrorists 
that disrupt the Middle East peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive 
Order  13099,  the  President  modified  the  Annex  to  Executive  Order  12947 
to  identify  four  additional  persons  who  threaten  to  disrupt  the  Middle 
East  peace  process.  On  February  16,  2005,  by  Executive  Order  13372,  the 
President clarified the steps taken in Executive Order 12947. 

These  terrorist  activities  continue  to  threaten  the  Middle  East  peace  process 
and  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures adopted 
to  deal  with  that  emergency  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  January  23, 
2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national 
emergency  with  respect  to  foreign  terrorists  who  threaten  to  disrupt  the 
Middle East peace process. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Presidential  Determination  No.  2016–10  of  September  12,  2016 

Presidential  Determination  on  Major  Drug  Transit  or  Major 
Illicit  Drug  Producing  Countries  for  Fiscal  Year  2017 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State 

Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Year  2003  (Public  Law  107–228)  (FRAA),  I  hereby  identify  the  following 
countries as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries: 
Afghanistan,  The  Bahamas,  Belize,  Bolivia,  Burma,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica, 
Dominican  Republic,  Ecuador,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  Haiti,  Honduras, 
India,  Jamaica,  Laos,  Mexico,  Nicaragua,  Pakistan,  Panama,  Peru,  and  Ven-
ezuela. 
A  country’s  presence  on  the  foregoing  Major  Drug  Transit  and  Major  Illicit 
Drug Producing Countries List is not a reflection of its government’s counter-
narcotics  efforts  or  level  of  cooperation  with  the  United  States.  Consistent 
with  the  statutory  definition  of  a  major  drug  transit  or  drug  producing 
country  set  forth  in  section  481(e)(2)  and  (5)  of  the  Foreign  Assistance 
Act  of  1961,  as  amended  (FAA),  the  reason  major  drug  transit  or  illicit 
drug  producing  countries  are  placed  on  the  list  is  the  combination  of  geo-
graphic,  commercial,  and  economic  factors  that  allow  drugs  to  transit  or 
be  produced,  even  if  a  government  has  carried  out  the  most  assiduous 
narcotics control law enforcement measures. 
Pursuant to section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia, Burma, 
and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 
12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics 
agreements  and  take  the  measures  set  forth  in  section  489(a)(1)  of  the  FAA. 
Included  in  this  report  are  justifications  for  the  determinations  on  Bolivia, 
Burma,  and  Venezuela,  as  required  by  section  706(2)(B).  Explanations  for 
these decisions are published with this determination. 
I  have  also  determined,  in  accordance  with  provisions  of  section  706(3)(A) 
of  the  FRAA,  that  support  for  programs  to  aid  Burma  and  Venezuela  is 
vital to the national interests of the United States. 
In  addition  to  emphasizing  the  importance  of  international  cooperation, 
this  determination  highlights  a  number  of  recent  developments  concerning 
various aspects associated with the worldwide drug problem. 
Growing Consensus on International Narcotics 
There  is  a  growing  international  consensus  that  counternarcotics  programs 
must  be  designed  and  implemented  with  the  aim  of  improving  the  health 
and  safety  of  individuals  while  preventing  and  reducing  violence  and  other 
harmful consequences to communities. 
In  concert  with  international  partners,  the  United  States  is  expanding  its 
domestic and international funding for drug treatment and recovery support 
programs  based  on  empirical  scientific  evidence  that  shows  that  substance 
use disorders are medical conditions and must be treated as such. To achieve 
greater  balance,  U.S.  drug  policy  also  includes  stepped-up  promotion  of 
effective alternative development programs for farmers and others who agree 
to  stop  illegal  drug  cultivation  and  associated  activities.  Such  efforts  also 
focus  on  advancing  the  rule  of  law  through  improving  and  strengthening 
civil and law enforcement institutions. United States polices support overall

human rights guaranteed by international law. 
This  consensus  was  demonstrated  at  the  United  Nations  General  Assembly 
Special  Session  on  the  World  Drug  Problem  (UNGASS)  held  on  April  19– 
21,  2016,  in  New  York.  The  meeting  served  as  the  first  high-level,  global 
gathering  on  counternarcotics  in  a  generation,  and  its  resulting  outcome 
document  forged  international  consensus  behind  a  balanced  and  pragmatic 
approach to drug control. A central theme of UNGASS was to further develop 
and  implement  strategies  based  on  the  UN  Commission  on  Narcotic  Drugs 
(CND)  2009  Political  Declaration  and  Action  Plan  aimed  at  reducing  drug 
production, trafficking, and use from the standpoint of effective public health 
practices. UNGASS participants, including the United States, also highlighted 
the  importance  of  substantive  advancement  of  the  UN’s  2030  Agenda  for 
Sustainable  Development,  which  for  the  first  time  in  history  incorporates 
rule of law objectives into global development policy. 
UNGASS  further  underscored  the  broad  consensus  among  United  Nations 
member  states  with  regard  to  many  major  drug  control  themes.  At  the 
special session, member states demonstrated their common cause to reinforce 
efforts to counter drug cultivation, production, distribution, and use through 
pragmatic  approaches  that  balance  both  law  enforcement  and  public  health 
perspectives.  As  stated  by  the  UN  International  Narcotics  Control  Board 
(INCB),  we  have  a  ‘‘common  obligation  to  employ  effective  drug  abuse 
prevention,  treatment,  and  rehabilitation  of  our  citizens.’’  Participants  also 
reaffirmed their ongoing commitment to the 1961, 1971, and 1988 UN conven-
tions  on  drugs  as  the  essential  backdrop  for  worldwide  drug  control  efforts. 
These  conventions  leave  sufficient  room  for  individual  states  to  pursue 
drug  policies  that  are  in  accord  with  their  own  laws  and  national  realities. 
The  foreign  policy  approaches  to  drug  control  of  the  United  States  are 
explained  in  detail  in  the  U.S.  National  Drug  Control  Strategy,  and  our 
policies  and  programs  are  designed  to  help  reach  the  goals  established 
at  UNGASS  and  work  effectively  with  partners  around  the  world.  They 
include,  for  example,  on  going  bilateral  cooperation  and  collaborative  work 
through  numerous  regional  and  sub-regional  multilateral  organizations  such 
as  the  Organization  of  American  States;  the  European  Union;  regional  affili-
ates  of  the  global  Financial  Action  Task  Force;  the  Economic  Community 
of  West  African  States;  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations;  and 
many  others.  The  United  States  also  joins  other  nations  in  supporting  the 
important,  positive  contributions  of  many  nongovernmental  organizations 
in the academic and private sectors that work on improving counternarcotics 
policies and programs. 
Growing Challenges of Heroin Use, Adulterants, and Opium Poppy Cultiva-
tion 
According  to  the  UN  Office  on  Drugs  and  Crime  (UNODC),  the  use  of 
heroin  and  other  opium  poppy  derivatives  is  the  greatest  worldwide  drug 
problem  today.  Heroin  is  also  the  greatest  drug  threat  in  the  United  States, 
according  to  the  2015  U.S.  National  Drug  Threat  Assessment  published 
by  the  U.S.  Drug  Enforcement  Administration.  Especially  dangerous  is  the 
increasing  adulteration  of  heroin  with  synthetic  opioids,  such  as  fentanyl, 
leading to an increase in the number of deaths as the result of drug overdoses. 
In  2014,  the  Centers  for  Disease  Control  reported  that  approximately  10,500 
Americans  died  from  heroin-related  overdoses;  the  true  number  likely  is 
higher given inconsistent testing across the States. 
Opium  poppy  cultivation  is  expanding  beyond  Afghanistan,  Burma,  and 
Laos the traditional primary producing countries in the world. While Afghani-
stan  is  still  the  major  supplier  of  opium  derivatives  to  Europe  and  Canada, 
nearly all opium derivatives found in the United States are primarily grown 
in or trafficked through Mexico or by Mexican-based drug trafficking organi-
zations.  In  Mexico,  for  example,  international  officials  estimate  that  the 
number of hectares of heroin poppy under cultivation increased from 11,000

hectares  in  2013  to  as  much  as  28,000  hectares  in  2015.  Limited  poppy 
cultivation also has been detected in Colombia and Guatemala. 
According  to  UNODC,  201,000  hectares  of  opium  poppy  were  cultivated 
in  Afghanistan  in  2015,  a  5  percent  decline  from  2014.  Comparative  data 
shows,  however,  that  while  cultivation  and  yields  declined  relative  to  pre-
vious years, cultivation is still at historically high levels. 
The  2016  U.S.  International  Narcotics  Control  Strategy  indicates  that  insur-
gent  groups  in  Afghanistan  generate  significant  revenue  by  taxing  drugs 
passing through regions they control. Afghan government drug control efforts 
are  hampered  by  broad  security  challenges  associated  with  intensive,  long- 
term  conflict  and  combat.  The  U.S.  Government  continues  to  support  a 
broad  range  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  drug  control  programs  in  Afghani-
stan. 
Although  many  treatment  and  recovery  facilities  established  in  Afghanistan 
show  great  promise,  the  2015  Afghanistan  National  Drug  Use  Survey  con-
ducted by the Department of State and the Afghan Ministry of Health Institu-
tional  Review  Board  found  an  11  percent  drug  positive  rate  in  Afghanistan. 
Use  of  heroin  and  other  opium  poppy  products,  according  to  international 
analysis, is also significant in Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan. 
The  INCB  is  also  concerned  about  the  increasing  use  of  Afghan  sourced 
heroin throughout the Middle East. 
Heroin  in  the  United  States  is  being  increasingly  adulterated  with  low- 
cost synthetic opioids, especially fentanyl. Research has shown that fentanyl 
and its analogues can be 25 to 50 times more potent than heroin. According 
to  U.S.  law  enforcement,  most  illicit  fentanyl,  precursors,  and  fentanyl  ana-
logues  that  have  been  identified  in  the  United  States  originate  in  China 
and enter the country via Mexico, Canada, or direct mail. The United States 
has  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  address  this  issue.  The  United  States  is 
working  with  Mexico  and  Canada  to  develop  bilateral  and  multilateral  ap-
proaches to combating opioid production and trafficking, particularly heroin 
and  fentanyl.  Law  enforcement  cooperation  with  Mexico  includes  programs 
to  strengthen  Mexico’s  capacity  to  identify,  investigate,  interdict  and  dis-
mantle  clandestine  drug  laboratories  and  disrupt  trafficking  networks.  The 
United  States  conducts  regular  and  positive  discussions  with  China  to  en-
hance controls on many chemicals used to make fentanyl and other synthetic 
drugs.  In  a  welcome  development  in  late  2015,  China  placed  controls  on 
116  substances  including  a  dangerous  analogue  to  fentanyl,  acetyl  fentanyl. 
Much  work  remains  to  be  done  in  this  area,  and  developing  compatible, 
consistent, enforceable international standards is crucial to successfully con-
trolling this growing drug threat. 
Cocaine and Coca Cultivation 
Although  international  and  U.S.  surveys  indicate  overall  production  of  coca 
leaf  for  cocaine  has  remained  stable  from  a  decade  ago,  Colombia  has  seen 
a  42  percent  increase  in  illegal  coca  crop  cultivation  from  2014  to  2015. 
Colombia  remains  the  major  provider  of  cocaine  available  in  the  United 
States, though data shows that cocaine use is declining in the United States 
and  in  Europe.  Nevertheless,  U.S.  rates  of  overdose  involving  cocaine  were 
up in 2014. 
Increased  Colombian  coca  cultivation  can  be  attributed  to  a  number  of 
factors,  including  Colombia’s  decision  to  end  the  aerial  coca  eradication 
program  in  October  2015  throughout  the  country.  Even  prior  to  the  end 
of spray eradication, coca growers began to implement ‘‘counter’’ eradication 
techniques,  such  as  by  migrating  their  plantings  to  areas  where  spray  was 
not permitted by law or policy. Illegal coca cultivators also began to cultivate 
smaller,  better  concealed  fields  to  avoid  detection  by  law  enforcement.  Co-
lombia  has  reformulated  its  counternarcotics  strategy  to  prioritize  robust 
law  enforcement  activity  against  criminal  drug  trafficking  organizations,  in-
cluding  enhanced  interdiction,  over  that  of  crop  eradication.  In  2015,  the 
country  seized  295  metric  tons  of  cocaine  along  with  other  illegal  drugs.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  182 / Tuesday,  September  20,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

To  reach  the  United  States,  cocaine  is  primarily  trafficked  by  land,  air, 
and  sea  via  Central  America,  Mexico,  and  the  Caribbean.  Over  the  past 
decade,  roughly  97  percent  of  U.S.  bound  cocaine  is  smuggled  out  of  South 
America  on  noncommercial  maritime  conveyances.  Smaller  amounts  are 
smuggled via commercial maritime vessels and noncommercial aircraft. Using 
similar  conveyances,  cocaine  destined  for  Europe  is  often  routed  through 
Brazil, Bolivia, and Venezuela, as well as via West Africa. 
Numerous large shipping containers have been interdicted on Atlantic routes, 
sometimes  with  a  first  stop  in  Portuguese  speaking  countries  in  Africa. 
Using  these  routes  reduces  language  barriers  before  the  drugs  are  smuggled 
to  their  final  destination.  A  variety  of  U.S.  assistance  programs,  especially 
those  designed  to  enhance  national  interdiction  capabilities  and  target  king-
pin traffickers, are carried out in Africa. 
United States assistance programs are designed to disrupt the flow of cocaine 
and  other  harmful  products  to  the  United  States  by  building  the  capacity 
of judicial, law enforcement, and treatment institutions in partner countries. 
For  example,  in  Central  America  these  programs  are  carried  out  through 
the Central America Regional Security Initiative, while those in the Caribbean 
are  conducted  through  the  Caribbean  Basin  Security  Initiative.  The  Merida 
Initiative  provides  the  framework  for  assistance  and  bilateral  cooperation 
with  Mexico.  Key  activities  of  these  programs  include  drug  interdiction 
cooperation,  especially  maritime-based  efforts  in  Central  America  and  the 
Caribbean; law enforcement capacity building; anticorruption initiatives and 
support; and enhanced prosecution and judicial reform strengthening efforts. 
Looking to the Future 
Future  action  by  the  international  community  to  address  drug  cultivation, 
production,  trafficking,  and  use  should  be  closely  tied  to  the  important 
priorities described in the 2016 UNGASS outcome document. These include, 
for  example,  utilization  of  sound  scientific  evidence  for  prevention  and 
treatment  programs,  effective  law  enforcement,  and  appropriately  balanced 
responses to drug-related crime. Areas of special concern include the connec-
tions  between  drug  use  and  human  rights,  especially  as  they  pertain  to 
vulnerable groups such as women and children. The exchange of information 
among  nations  and  between  professionals  engaged  in  reducing  drug  traf-
ficking  and  use,  and  efforts  to  stay  ahead  of  new  and  threatening  develop-
ments, such as synthetic substances, are central to progress by communities, 
countries, and regions around the world. 
The  U.S.  Government  will  continue  to  work  with  fellow  United  Nations 
member states to galvanize the international community toward implementa-
tion  of  the  principles  that  were  agreed  upon  at  the  2016  UNGASS.  General 
coordination among concerned United Nations entities is particularly impor-
tant.  This  includes  collaboration  among  bodies  within  the  UN  structure 
as  a  whole,  but  particularly  those  that  concern  themselves  to  some  extent 
with drug control and related social issues.

Blocking  Property  of  the  Government  of  North  Korea  and  the 
Workers’  Party  of  Korea,  and  Prohibiting  Certain  Trans-

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.)  (IEEPA),  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1601  et  seq.),  the  United  Nations  Participation  Act

gration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1952  (8  U.S.C.  1182(f)),  and  section  301 
of  title  3,  United  States  Code,  and  in  view  of  United  Nations  Security 
Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2270 of March 2, 2016, 
I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  find  that 
the  Government  of  North  Korea’s  continuing  pursuit  of  its  nuclear  and 
missile programs, as evidenced most recently by its February 7, 2016, launch 
using  ballistic  missile  technology  and  its  January  6,  2016,  nuclear  test  in 
violation of its obligations pursuant to numerous UNSCRs and in contraven-
tion  of  its  commitments  under  the  September  19,  2005,  Joint  Statement 
of the Six-Party Talks, increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. 
To  address  those  actions,  and  to  take  additional  steps  with  respect  to  the 
national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466  of  June  26,  2008, 
as  modified  in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps  in  subsequent 
Executive Orders, I hereby order: 
Section  1.  (a)  All  property  and  interests  in  property  that  are  in  the  United 
States,  that  hereafter  come  within  the  United  States,  or  that  are  or  hereafter 
come  within  the  possession  or  control  of  any  United  States  person  of  the 
Government  of  North  Korea  or  the  Workers’  Party  of  Korea  are  blocked 
and  may  not  be  transferred,  paid,  exported,  withdrawn,  or  otherwise  dealt 
in. 

(b)  The  prohibitions  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  apply  except  to 
the  extent  provided  by  statutes,  or  in  regulations,  orders,  directives,  or 
licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order or pursuant to the export 
control  authorities  implemented  by  the  Department  of  Commerce,  and  not-
withstanding  any  contract  entered  into  or  any  license  or  permit  granted 
prior to the effective date of this order. 
Sec.  2.  (a)  All  property  and  interests  in  property  that  are  in  the  United 
States,  that  hereafter  come  within  the  United  States,  or  that  are  or  hereafter 
come  within  the  possession  or  control  of  any  United  States  person  of  the 
following  persons  are  blocked  and  may  not  be  transferred,  paid,  exported, 
withdrawn,  or  otherwise  dealt  in:  any  person  determined  by  the  Secretary

my  ability  to  deal  with  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13466,  and  I  hereby  prohibit  such  donations  as  provided  by  sections  1 
and 2 of this order. 
Sec.  6.  The  prohibitions  in  sections  1  and  2  of  this  order  include  but 
are not limited to: 

(a) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 
by,  to,  or  for  the  benefit  of  any  person  whose  property  and  interests  in 
property are blocked pursuant to this order; and 

(b) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services 

from any such person. 
Sec. 7. (a) Any transaction that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading 
or  avoiding,  causes  a  violation  of,  or  attempts  to  violate  any  of  the  prohibi-
tions set forth in this order is prohibited. 

(b)  Any  conspiracy  formed  to  violate  any  of  the  prohibitions  set  forth 

in this order is prohibited. 
Sec.  8.  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  prohibit  transactions  for  the  conduct 
of  the  official  business  of  the  Federal  Government  or  the  United  Nations 
(including its specialized agencies, programmes, funds, and related organiza-
tions) by employees, grantees, or contractors thereof. 
Sec. 9. For the purposes of this order: 

(a) the term ‘‘person’’ means an individual or entity; 
(b) the term ‘‘entity’’ means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, 

corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; 

(c)  the  term  ‘‘United  States  person’’  means  any  United  States  citizen, 
permanent  resident  alien,  entity  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United 
States  or  any  jurisdiction  within  the  United  States  (including  foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; and 

(d)  the  term  ‘‘Government  of  North  Korea’’  means  the  Government  of 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and its agencies, instrumentalities,

Sec.  10.  For  those  persons  whose  property  and  interests  in  property  are 
blocked  pursuant  to  this  order  who  might  have  a  constitutional  presence

or  other  assets  instantaneously,  prior  notice  to  such  persons  of  measures 
to  be  taken  pursuant  to  this  order  would  render  those  measures  ineffectual. 
I  therefore  determine  that  for  these  measures  to  be  effective  in  addressing 
the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466,  there  need  be 
no  prior  notice  of  a  listing  or  determination  made  pursuant  to  section 
1 or 2 of this order. 
Sec.  11.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary

by  IEEPA  and  the  UNPA  as  may  be  necessary  to  carry  out  the  purposes 
of  this  order.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  may  redelegate  any  of  these 
functions  to  other  officers  and  agencies  of  the  United  States  Government 
consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government

The  President 

Presidential Documents

40775 

Notice  of  June  21,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
North  Korea 

On  June  26,  2008,  by  Executive  Order  13466,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  existence  and  risk  of  proliferation 
of  weapons-usable  fissile  material  on  the  Korean  Peninsula.  The  President 
also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect 
to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclama-
tion  8271  of  June  26,  2008,  which  terminated  the  exercise  of  authorities 
under  the  Trading  With  the  Enemy  Act  (50  U.S.C.  App.  1–44)  with  respect 
to North Korea. 
On  August  30,  2010,  I  signed  Executive  Order  13551,  which  expanded 
the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States  posed  by  the  continued 
actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  North  Korea,  manifested  by  its 
unprovoked  attack  that  resulted  in  the  sinking  of  the  Republic  of  Korea 
Navy ship Cheonan and the deaths of 46 sailors in March 2010; its announced 
test  of  a  nuclear  device  and  its  missile  launches  in  2009;  its  actions  in 
violation  of  United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolutions  1718  and  1874, 
including  the  procurement  of  luxury  goods;  and  its  illicit  and  deceptive 
activities  in  international  markets  through  which  it  obtains  financial  and 
other  support,  including  money  laundering,  the  counterfeiting  of  goods  and 
currency,  bulk  cash  smuggling,  and  narcotics  trafficking,  which  destabilize 
the  Korean  Peninsula  and  imperil  U.S.  Armed  Forces,  allies,  and  trading 
partners in the region. 
On  April  18,  2011,  I  signed  Executive  Order  13570  to  take  additional  steps 
to  address  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466  and 
expanded  in  Executive  Order  13551  that  will  ensure  the  implementation 
of  the  import  restrictions  contained  in  United  Nations  Security  Council 
Resolutions 1718 and 1874 and complement the import restrictions provided 
for in the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.). 
On  January  2,  2015,  I  signed  Executive  Order  13687  to  take  further  steps 
with  respect  to  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466, 
as  expanded  in  Executive  Order  13551,  and  addressed  further  in  Executive 
Order  13570,  to  address  the  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy, 
and  economy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  provocative,  desta-
bilizing,  and  repressive  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  North 
Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during Novem-
ber  and  December  2014,  actions  in  violation  of  United  Nations  Security 
Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious 
human rights abuses. 
On  March  15,  2016,  I  signed  Executive  Order  13722  to  take  additional 
steps  with  respect  to  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13466,  as  modified  in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps  in  subse-
quent  Executive  Orders,  to  address  the  Government  of  North  Korea’s  con-
tinuing  pursuit  of  its  nuclear  and  missile  programs,  as  evidenced  by  its 
February  7,  2016,  launch  using  ballistic  missile  technology  and  its  January

United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolutions  and  in  contravention  of  its 
commitments  under  the  September  19,  2005,  Joint  Statement  of  the  Six- 
Party Talks, that increasingly imperils the United States and its allies. Execu-
tive  Order  13722  also  implements  certain  multilateral  sanctions  imposed 
under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270. 
The  existence  and  risk  of  proliferation  of  weapons-usable  fissile  material 
on  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  the  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government 
of  North  Korea  continue  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to 
the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States. 
For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466, 
expanded in scope in Executive Order 13551, addressed further in Executive 
Order  13570,  further  expanded  in  scope  in  Executive  Order  13687,  and 
under which additional steps were taken in Executive Order 13722 of March 
15,  2016,  and  the  measures  taken  to  deal  with  that  national  emergency, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  June  26,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  North 
Korea declared in Executive Order 13466. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9496  of  September  15,  2016 

Northeast  Canyons  and  Seamounts  Marine  National  Monu-
ment 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  generations,  communities  and  families  have  relied  on  the  waters  of 
the  northwest  Atlantic  Ocean  and  have  told  of  their  wonders.  Throughout 
New  England,  the  maritime  trades,  and  especially  fishing,  have  supported 
a  vibrant  way  of  life,  with  deep  cultural  roots  and  a  strong  connection 
to  the  health  of  the  ocean  and  the  bounty  it  provides.  Over  the  past  several 
decades,  the  Nation  has  made  great  strides  in  its  stewardship  of  the  ocean, 
but  the  ocean  faces  new  threats  from  varied  uses,  climate  change,  and 
related  impacts.  Through  exploration,  we  continue  to  make  new  discoveries 
and  improve  our  understanding  of  ocean  ecosystems.  In  these  waters,  the 
Atlantic  Ocean  meets  the  continental  shelf  in  a  region  of  great  abundance 
and  diversity  as  well  as  stark  geological  relief.  The  waters  are  home  to 
many  species  of  deep-sea  corals,  fish,  whales  and  other  marine  mammals. 
Three  submarine  canyons  and,  beyond  them,  four  undersea  mountains  lie 
in  the  waters  approximately  130  miles  southeast  of  Cape  Cod.  This  area 
(the  canyon  and  seamount  area)  includes  unique  ecological  resources  that 
have long been the subject of scientific interest. 
The  canyon  and  seamount  area,  which  will  constitute  the  monument  as 
set  forth  in  this  proclamation,  is  composed  of  two  units,  which  showcase 
two  distinct  geological  features  that  support  vulnerable  ecological  commu-
nities.  The  Canyons  Unit  includes  three  underwater  canyons—Oceanog-
rapher,  Gilbert,  and  Lydonia—and  covers  approximately  941  square  miles. 
The  Seamounts  Unit  includes  four  seamounts—Bear,  Mytilus,  Physalia,  and 
Retriever—and  encompasses  3,972  square  miles.  The  canyon  and  seamount 
area  includes  the  waters  and  submerged  lands  within  the  coordinates  in-
cluded  in  the  accompanying  map.  The  canyon  and  seamount  area  contains 
objects of historic and scientific interest that are situated upon lands owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government.  These  objects  are  the  canyons 
and  seamounts  themselves,  and  the  natural  resources  and  ecosystems  in 
and around them. 
The  canyons  start  at  the  edge  of  the  geological  continental  shelf  and  drop 
from  200  meters  to  thousands  of  meters  deep.  The  seamounts  are  farther 
off shore, at the start of the New England Seamount chain, rising thousands 
of  meters  from  the  ocean  floor.  These  canyons  and  seamounts  are  home 
to  at  least  54  species  of  deep-sea  corals,  which  live  at  depths  of  at  least 
3,900 meters below the sea surface. The corals, together with other structure- 
forming fauna such as sponges and anemones, create a foundation for vibrant 
deep-sea  ecosystems,  providing  food,  spawning  habitat,  and  shelter  for  an 
array of fish and invertebrate species. These habitats are extremely sensitive 
to disturbance from extractive activities. 
Because  of  the  steep  slopes  of  the  canyons  and  seamounts,  oceanographic 
currents that encounter them create localized eddies and result in upwelling. 
Currents  lift  nutrients,  like  nitrates  and  phosphates,  critical  to  the  growth 
of  phytoplankton  from  the  deep  to  sunlit  surface  waters.  These  nutrients 
fuel  an  eruption  of  phytoplankton  and  zooplankton  that  form  the  base  of 
the  food  chain.  Aggregations  of  plankton  draw  large  schools  of  small  fish

and  then  larger  animals  that  prey  on  these  fish,  such  as  whales,  sharks, 
tunas,  and  seabirds.  Together  the  geology,  currents,  and  productivity  create 
diverse and vibrant ecosystems. 
The Canyons 
Canyons cut deep into the geological continental shelf and slope throughout 
the  mid-Atlantic  and  New  England  regions.  They  are  susceptible  to  active 
erosion  and  powerful  ocean  currents  that  transport  sediments  and  organic 
carbon  from  the  shelf  through  the  canyons  to  the  deep  ocean  floor.  In 
Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia canyons, the hard canyon walls provide 
habitats  for  sponges,  corals,  and  other  invertebrates  that  filter  food  from 
the water to flourish, and for larger species including squid, octopus, skates, 
flounders, and crabs. Major oceanographic features, such as currents, tempera-
ture  gradients,  eddies,  and  fronts,  occur  on  a  large  scale  and  influence 
the  distribution  patterns  of  such  highly  migratory  oceanic  species  as  tuna, 
billfish,  and  sharks.  They  provide  feeding  grounds  for  these  and  many 
other marine species. 
Toothed  whales,  such  as  the  endangered  sperm  whale,  and  many  species 
of  beaked  whales  are  strongly  attracted  to  the  environments  created  by 
submarine  canyons.  Surveys  of  the  area  show  significantly  higher  numbers 
of  beaked  whales  present  in  canyon  regions  than  in  non-canyon  shelf-edge 
regions.  Endangered  sperm  whales,  iconic  in  the  region  due  to  the  historic 
importance of the species to New England’s whaling communities, preferen-
tially  inhabit  the  U.S.  Atlantic  continental  margin.  Two  additional  species 
of  endangered  whales  (fin  whales  and  sei  whales)  have  also  been  observed 
in the canyon and seamount area. 
The Seamounts 
The  New  England  Seamount  Chain  was  formed  as  the  Earth’s  crust  passed 
over  a  stationary  hot  spot  that  pushed  magma  up  through  the  seafloor, 
and  is  now  composed  of  more  than  30  extinct  undersea  volcanoes,  running 
like  a  curved  spine  from  the  southern  side  of  Georges  Bank  to  midway 
across  the  western  Atlantic  Ocean.  Many  of  them  have  characteristic  flat 
tops  that  were  created  by  erosion  by  ocean  waves  and  subsidence  as  the 
magma  cooled.  Four  of  these  seamounts—Bear,  Physalia,  Retriever,  and 
Mytilus—are in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone. Bear Seamount 
is  approximately  100  million  years  old  and  the  largest  of  the  four;  it  rises 
approximately  2,500  meters  from  the  seafloor  to  within  1,000  meters  of 
the  sea  surface.  Its  summit  is  over  12  miles  in  diameter.  The  three  smaller 
seamounts  reach  to  within  2,000  meters  of  the  surface.  All  four  of  these 
seamounts  have  steep  and  complex  topography  that  interrupts  existing  cur-
rents,  providing  a  constant  supply  of  plankton  and  nutrients  to  the  animals 
that  inhabit  their  sides.  They  also  cause  upwelling  of  nutrient-rich  waters 
toward the ocean surface. 
Geographically isolated from the continental platform, these seamounts sup-
port  highly  diverse  ecological  communities  with  deep-sea  corals  that  are 
hundreds  or  thousands  of  years  old  and  a  wide  array  of  other  benthic 
marine organisms not found on the surrounding deep-sea floor. They provide 
shelter  from  predators,  increased  food,  nurseries,  and  spawning  areas.  The 
New  England  seamounts  have  many  rare  and  endemic  species,  several  of 
which  are  new  to  science  and  are  not  known  to  live  anywhere  else  on 
Earth. 
The Ecosystem 
The  submarine  canyons  and  seamounts  create  dynamic  currents  and  eddies 
that  enhance  biological  productivity  and  provide  feeding  grounds  for 
seabirds; pelagic species, including whales, dolphins, and turtles; and highly 
migratory  fish,  such  as  tunas,  billfish,  and  sharks.  More  than  ten  species 
of  shark,  including  great  white  sharks,  are  known  to  utilize  the  feeding 
grounds  of  the  canyon  and  seamount  area.  Additionally,  surveys  of 
leatherback and loggerhead turtles in the area have revealed increased num-
bers  above  and  immediately  adjacent  to  the  canyons  and  Bear  Seamount.

Marine birds concentrate in upwelling areas near the canyons and seamounts. 
Several  species  of  gulls,  shearwaters,  storm  petrels,  gannets,  skuas,  and 
terns,  among  others,  are  regularly  observed  in  the  region,  sometimes  in 
large  aggregations.  Recent  analysis  of  geolocation  data  found  that  Maine’s 
vulnerable  Atlantic  puffin  frequents  the  canyon  and  seamount  area  between 
September  and  March,  indicating  a  previously  unknown  wintering  habitat 
for those birds. 
These  canyons  and  seamounts,  and  the  ecosystem  they  compose,  have  long 
been  of  intense  scientific  interest.  Scientists  from  government  and  academic 
oceanographic  institutions  have  studied  the  canyons  and  seamounts  using 
research  vessels,  submarines,  and  remotely  operated  underwater  vehicles 
for important deep-sea expeditions that have yielded new information about 
living marine resources. Much remains to be discovered about these unique, 
isolated  environments  and  their  geological,  ecological,  and  biological  re-
sources. 
WHEREAS,  the  waters  and  submerged  lands  in  and  around  the  deep-sea 
canyons  Oceanographer,  Lydonia,  and  Gilbert,  and  the  seamounts  Bear, 
Physalia,  Retriever,  and  Mytilus,  contain  objects  of  scientific  and  historic 
interest  that  are  situated  upon  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal 
Government; 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (the  ‘‘Antiquities 
Act’’), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public procla-
mation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  structures,  and  other 
objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated  upon  the  lands 
owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  to  be  national  monuments, 
and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits  of  which  shall 
be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and manage-
ment of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  marine  environment, 
including  the  waters  and  submerged  lands,  in  the  area  to  be  known  as 
the  Northeast  Canyons  and  Seamounts  Marine  National  Monument,  for  the 
care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest therein; 
WHEREAS, the well-being of the United States, the prosperity of its citizens 
and  the  protection  of  the  ocean  environment  are  complementary  and  rein-
forcing  priorities;  and  the  United  States  continues  to  act  with  due  regard 
for the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea enjoyed by other nations 
under  the  law  of  the  sea  in  managing  the  canyon  and  seamount  area  and 
does  not  compromise  the  readiness,  training,  and  global  mobility  of  the 
U.S. Armed Forces when establishing marine protected areas; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Northeast  Canyons  and  Seamounts  Marine 
National  Monument  (monument)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those 
objects,  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on  the  accompanying  map  entitled  ‘‘Northeast  Canyons  and  Seamounts  Ma-
rine  National  Monument,’’  which  is  attached  hereto,  and  forms  a  part  of 
this  proclamation.  The  Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  reserved  consist 
of  approximately  4,913  square  miles,  which  is  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected. 
The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  All 
Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monument 
are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from  all  forms  of  entry,  location, 
selection,  sale,  leasing,  or  other  disposition  under  the  public  land  laws 
to the extent that those laws apply, including but not limited to, withdrawal 
from  location,  entry  and  patent  under  mining  laws,  and  from  disposition 
under  all  laws  relating  to  development  of  oil  and  gas,  minerals,  geothermal,

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Through  Proclamation  8031  of  June  15,  2006,  as  amended  by  Proclamation 
8112 of February 28, 2007, the President established the Papaha¯naumokua¯kea 
Marine National Monument (Monument), to protect and preserve the marine 
area  of  the  Northwestern  Hawaiian  Islands  and  the  historic  and  scientific 
objects  therein.  As  stated  in  Proclamation  8031,  the  area,  including  the 
Northwestern  Hawaiian  Islands  Coral  Reef  Ecosystem  Reserve,  the  Midway 
Atoll  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  the  Battle  of  Midway  National  Memorial, 
and  the  Hawaiian  Islands  National  Wildlife  Refuge,  supports  a  dynamic 
reef ecosystem with more than 7,000 marine species, of which approximately 
one  quarter  are  unique  to  the  Hawaiian  Islands.  This  diverse  ecosystem 
is  home  to  many  species  of  coral,  fish,  birds,  marine  mammals,  and  other 
flora  and  fauna,  including  the  endangered  Hawaiian  monk  seal,  the  threat-
ened  green  sea  turtle,  and  the  endangered  leatherback  and  hawksbill  sea 
turtles.  In  addition,  this  area  has  great  cultural  significance  to  the  Native 
Hawaiian  community  and  a  connection  to  early  Polynesian  culture  worthy 
of protection and understanding. 
An  area  adjacent  to  the  Monument,  and  that  will  constitute  the  Monument 
Expansion  as  set  forth  in  this  proclamation,  includes  the  waters  and  sub-
merged lands to the extent of the seaward limit of the United States Exclusive 
Economic  Zone  (U.S.  EEZ)  west  of  163°  West  Longitude,  and  extending 
from  the  boundaries  depicted  on  the  map  accompanying  Proclamation  8031 
as amended by Proclamation 8112 (adjacent area). 
As  required  by  the  Antiquities  Act,  the  adjacent  area  contains  objects  of 
historic  and  scientific  interest  that  are  situated  upon  lands  owned  or  con-
trolled  by  the  Federal  Government;  they  are  geological  and  biological  re-
sources that are part of a highly pristine deep sea and open ocean ecosystem 
with  unique  biodiversity  and  that  constitute  a  sacred  cultural,  physical, 
and spiritual place for the Native Hawaiian community. 
This  unique  ecosystem  has  many  significant  features.  Important  geological 
features  of  the  adjacent  area  include  more  than  75  seamounts,  as  well 
as  a  non-volcanic  ridge  that  extends  southwest  towards  the  Johnston  Atoll. 
Together,  these  features  form  biodiverse  hotspots  in  the  open  ocean  that 
provide  habitat  for  deep-sea  species,  including  sponges,  other  invertebrates, 
fish,  and  colonies  of  corals  many  thousands  of  years  old.  Recent  science 
demonstrates  that  seamounts  harbor  a  multitude  of  species  with  unique 
ecological traits, some newly discovered. Seamounts, ridges, and other under-
sea  topographic  features  are  important  stepping  stones  that  enable  marine 
organisms  to  spread  throughout  the  Hawaiian  Archipelago,  and  between 
Hawaii  and  other  archipelagoes.  Undisturbed  seamount  communities  in  the 
adjacent area are of significant scientific interest because they provide oppor-
tunities  to  examine  the  impacts  of  physical,  biological,  and  geological  proc-
esses on ecosystem diversity, including understanding the impacts of climate 
change  on  these  deep-sea  communities.  These  seamounts  and  ridges  also 
provide  the  opportunity  for  identification  and  discovery  of  many  species 
not yet known to humans, with possible implications for research, medicine, 
and other important uses.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  169 / Wednesday,  August  31,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

Recent  scientific  research,  utilizing  new  technology,  has  shown  that  many 
species  identified  as  objects  in  Proclamation  8031  inhabit  previously  un-
known  geographical  ranges  that  span  beyond  the  existing  Monument,  and 
in  some  cases  the  adjacent  area  also  provides  important  foraging  habitat 
for  these  species.  For  example,  the  endangered  Hawaiian  monk  seal  forages 
well  beyond  the  existing  Monument.  Scientific  research  on  Hawaiian  monk 
seal  foraging  behavior  has  shown  that  monk  seals  may  travel  80  miles 
and dive to depths of almost 2,000 feet while feeding. 
Important  bird  species  abound  in  the  Monument  and  the  adjacent  area. 
Birds  from  the  world’s  largest  colonies  of  Laysan  albatross,  Black-footed 
albatross, and Bonin petrels, as well as significant populations of shearwaters, 
petrels,  tropicbirds,  the  endangered  Short-tailed  albatross,  and  other  seabird 
species  forage  in  the  adjacent  area.  We  now  know  that  albatrosses  and 
Great  Frigatebirds  rely  on  the  adjacent  area  during  chick-brooding  periods, 
when  their  foraging  is  focused  within  200  miles  of  the  nesting  colonies 
on  the  Monument’s  islands  and  atolls.  At  other  times,  these  wide-ranging 
species use a much broader range (over 1,600 miles) for foraging. 
The adjacent area is a foraging and migration path for five species of protected 
sea  turtles.  While  green  and  hawksbill  turtles  use  the  near-shore  waters 
of  the  Monument  for  nesting,  these  species—along  with  the  endangered 
leatherback turtle and threatened loggerhead and olive ridley turtles—migrate 
through the adjacent area to reach high-productivity foraging areas. 
Twenty-four species of whales and dolphins have been sighted in the adjacent 
area.  Three  of  these  species  are  listed  under  the  Endangered  Species  Act 
as  threatened  or  endangered:  sperm  whales,  fin  whales,  and  sei  whales. 
Cetacean  use  of  the  Monument  Expansion  varies;  resident  species  such 
as  spinner  dolphins,  false  killer  whales,  and  rough-toothed  dolphins  utilize 
the  area  year-round,  whereas  other  species,  such  as  humpback  whales,  use 
it  as  a  wintering  area.  A  wide  variety  of  tropical  and  temperate  water 
dolphin  species  inhabit  the  Monument  Expansion,  including  pantropical 
spotted  dolphins,  spinner  dolphins,  striped  dolphins,  rough-toothed  dol-
phins,  and  bottlenose  dolphins.  Several  rarely  sighted  species  of  dolphin 
inhabit  the  area,  including  Risso’s  and  Fraser’s  dolphins.  Both  of  these 
species are primarily oceanic and found in waters deeper than 1,000 meters. 
Acoustic  evidence  also  shows  that  endangered  blue  whales—the  largest  ani-
mals  on  Earth—visit  the  area  and  may  migrate  past  the  Hawaiian  Islands 
twice a year. 
Sharks,  including  tiger  sharks  and  Galapagos  sharks,  are  key  species  in 
the  ecosystems  of  the  Monument  and  adjacent  area.  These  large  and  highly 
mobile  predators  have  expansive  home  ranges  and  regularly  move  across 
the boundaries of the current Monument into the adjacent waters. Addition-
ally,  blue  sharks,  three  species  of  thresher  sharks,  and  two  species  of  mako 
sharks inhabit the open ocean environment of the adjacent area. 
The  Monument  and  adjacent  area  are  part  of  the  most  remote  island  archi-
pelago  on  Earth.  This  biological  and  geographic  isolation,  coupled  with 
unique oceanographic and geological conditions, has resulted in an ecosystem 
critical  for  new  species  formation  and  endemism.  These  forces  result  in 
some  of  the  most  unique  and  diverse  ecological  communities  on  the  planet. 
Importance to Native Hawaiian Culture 
The  ocean  will  always  be  seen  as  an  integral  part  of  cultural  identity  for 
the  Native  Hawaiian  community.  The  deep  sea,  the  ocean  surface,  the  sky, 
and all the living things in the area adjacent to the Monument are important 
to  this  culture  and  are  deeply  rooted  in  creation  and  settlement  stories. 
Native  Hawaiian  culture  considers  the  Monument  and  the  adjacent  area 
a  sacred  place.  This  place  contains  the  boundary  between  Ao,  the  world 
of  light  and  the  living,  and  Po¯,  the  world  of  the  gods  and  spirits  from 
which  all  life  is  born  and  to  which  ancestors  return  after  death.  Long- 
distance  voyaging  and  wayfinding  is  one  of  the  most  unique  and  valuable 
traditional  practices  that  the  Native  Hawaiian  community  has  developed

and  continues  to  advance.  Once  on  the  verge  of  cultural  extinction,  new 
double-hulled  sailing  canoes,  beginning  with  the  Ho¯ku¯ le1a  in  the  1970s, 
are  bringing  voyaging  and  wayfinding  to  new  generations.  This  traditional 
practice  relies  on  celestial,  biological,  and  natural  signs,  such  as  winds, 
waves,  currents  and  the  presence  of  birds  and  marine  life.  The  open  ocean 
ecosystem  and  its  natural  resources  in  the  adjacent  area  play  an  important 
role within the cultural voyaging seascape within the Hawaiian Archipelago. 
Shipwrecks 
World  War  II  shipwrecks  and  aircraft  in  the  adjacent  area,  though  not 
identified  as  objects  under  the  Antiquities  Act  in  this  proclamation,  are 
of  great  historic  interest.  The  naval  portion  of  the  Battle  of  Midway,  one 
of the most important naval battles of World War II, occurred approximately 
200  miles  to  the  northeast  of  Midway  Atoll,  in  the  adjacent  area.  Deep- 
sea technologies have enabled the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier torpedoed 
during  the  battle,  to  be  found  at  more  than  16,000  feet  below  the  ocean’s 
surface.  Eyewitness  accounts  and  historical  records  tell  the  stories  of  the 
destroyer  USS  Hammann,  five  Japanese  vessels  (the  four  aircraft  carriers 
Hiryu, Soryu, Kaga, and Akagi, and the cruiser Mikuma), and several hundred 
aircraft  that  were  also  lost  during  the  battle  in  this  area.  The  locations 
of  these  vessels  have  yet  to  be  identified.  All  told,  the  adjacent  area  serves 
as  a  final  resting  place  for  the  more  than  3,000  people  lost  during  the 
battle. 
WHEREAS,  the  waters  and  submerged  lands  adjacent  to  the  Monument 
(west  of  163°  West  Longitude  and  seaward  from  the  boundaries  delineated 
in  Proclamation  8031  as  amended  by  Proclamation  8112  out  to  the  limit 
of  the  U.S.  EEZ)  contain  objects  of  historic  and  scientific  interest  that  are 
situated upon lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government; 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (the  ‘‘Antiquities 
Act’’), authorizes the President, in his discretion, to declare by public procla-
mation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  structures,  and  other 
objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated  upon  lands  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  to  be  national  monuments,  and 
to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits  of  which  in  all 
cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  marine  environment, 
including  the  waters  and  submerged  lands  in  the  U.S.  EEZ  west  of  163° 
West Longitude adjacent to Papaha¯naumokua¯kea Marine National Monument 
for  the  care  and  management  of  the  historic  and  scientific  objects  therein; 
WHEREAS, the well-being of the United States, the prosperity of its citizens 
and  the  protection  of  the  ocean  environment  are  complementary  and  rein-
forcing  priorities;  and  the  United  States  continues  to  act  with  due  regard 
for the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea enjoyed by other nations 
under  the  law  of  the  sea  in  managing  the  Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Marine 
National Monument and adjacent areas, and does not compromise the readi-
ness,  training,  and  global  mobility  of  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces  when  estab-
lishing marine protected areas; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  part  of  the  Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Marine  National 
Monument  Expansion  (Monument  Expansion)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  pro-
tecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  all  lands  and  interests  in 
lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government within the boundaries 
described  on  the  accompanying  map  entitled  ‘‘Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Marine 
National  Monument  Expansion’’  attached  hereto,  which  forms  a  part  of 
this proclamation. The Monument Expansion comprises the waters and sub-
merged  lands  in  the  U.S.  EEZ  west  of  163°  West  Longitude  adjacent  to

and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to  development  of  oil  and 
gas,  minerals,  geothermal,  or  renewable  energy.  Lands  and  interest  in  lands 
within  the  Monument  Expansion  not  owned  or  controlled  by  the  United 
States shall be reserved as part of the Monument Expansion upon acquisition 
of title or control by the United States. 
Management of the Marine National Monument 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  change  the  management  of  the 
Papaha¯naumokua¯kea  Marine  National  Monument  or  any  of  the  provisions 
specified  in  Proclamations  8031  and  8112.  Terms  used  in  this  proclamation 
shall  have  the  same  meaning  as  those  defined  in  Proclamation  8031.  The 
Secretaries  of  Commerce  and  the  Interior  (Secretaries)  shall  share  manage-
ment  responsibility  for  the  Monument  Expansion.  The  Secretary  of  Com-
merce,  through  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration 
(NOAA),  and  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  shall  have 
responsibility for management of activities and species within the Monument 
Expansion  under  the  Magnuson-Stevens  Fishery  Conservation  and  Manage-
ment  Act,  the  Endangered  Species  Act  (for  species  regulated  by  NOAA), 
the  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act,  and  any  other  applicable  Department 
of  Commerce  legal  authorities.  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior,  through  the 
United  States  Fish  and  Wildlife  Service  (FWS),  and  in  consultation  with 
the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  shall  have  responsibility  for  management  of 
activities  and  species  within  the  Monument  Expansion  under  its  applicable 
legal authorities, including the National Wildlife Refuge System Administra-

the  national  interest;  provided  that  this  number  shall  be  understood  as 
including persons admitted to the United States during FY 2017 with Federal

program, as provided below. 
The admissions numbers shall be allocated among refugees of special humani-

Additionally, upon notification to the Judiciary Committees of the Congress, 
you  are  further  authorized  to  transfer  unused  admissions  allocated  to  a 
particular  region  to  one  or  more  other  regions,  if  there  is  a  need  for  greater

Memorandum  of  April  29,  2016 

Promoting  Rehabilitation  and  Reintegration  of  Formerly  In-
carcerated  Individuals 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

America  is  a  Nation  of  second  chances.  Promoting  the  rehabilitation  and 
reintegration  of  individuals  who  have  paid  their  debt  to  society  makes 
communities  safer  by  reducing  recidivism  and  victimization;  assists  those 
who return from prison, jail, or juvenile justice facilities to become productive 
citizens;  and  saves  taxpayer  dollars  by  lowering  the  direct  and  collateral 
costs of incarceration. Policies that limit opportunities for people with crimi-
nal  records  create  barriers  to  employment,  education,  housing,  health  care, 
and  civic  participation.  This  lack  of  opportunity  decreases  public  safety, 
increases costs to society, and tears at the fabric of our Nation’s communities. 
Reducing  the  cycle  of  incarceration  and  recidivism  requires  coordinated 
action  by  government  at  all  levels.  Estimates  are  that  as  many  as  70  million 
or more Americans have a record of arrest, criminal adjudication, or convic-
tion.  Each  year,  more  than  600,000  individuals  are  released  from  Federal 
and  State  correctional  facilities.  Millions  more  are  released  each  year  from 
local  jails.  In  many  cases,  a  criminal  record  is  an  obstacle  to  obtaining 
employment  or  a  license  related  to  or  necessary  for  employment.  However, 
many  individuals  have  criminal  histories  that  should  not  automatically  dis-
qualify them from employment or licensing, but should instead be examined 
as part of a review of the person as a whole. Providing incarcerated individ-
uals  with  job  and  life  skills,  education  programming,  and  mental  health 
and  addiction  treatment  increases  the  likelihood  that  such  individuals  will 
be  successful  when  released.  And  removing  barriers  to  successful  reentry 
helps formerly incarcerated individuals compete for jobs, attain stable hous-
ing, and support their families. All of these are critical to reducing recidivism 
and strengthening communities. 
In 2011, the Attorney General formed the Federal Interagency Reentry Coun-
cil,  a  Cabinet-level  working  group  dedicated  to  the  rehabilitation  and  re-
integration  of  individuals  returning  to  their  communities  from  prisons  and 
jails.  I  am  issuing  this  memorandum  to  ensure  that  the  Federal  Government 
continues  the  important  work  of  this  council  and  builds  on  its  successes. 
By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following: 
Section  1.  Establishing  the  Federal  Interagency  Reentry  Council.  (a)  There 
is hereby established the Federal Interagency Reentry Council (Reentry Coun-
cil),  to  be  co-chaired  by  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Director  of  the  White 
House  Domestic  Policy  Council.  In  addition  to  the  Co-Chairs,  the  Reentry 
Council shall include the heads of: 

(i) the Department of the Treasury; 
(ii) the Department of the Interior; 
(iii) the Department of Agriculture; 
(iv) the Department of Commerce; 
(v) the Department of Labor; 
(vi) the Department of Health and Human Services;

Sec.  2.  Reducing  Barriers  to  Employment.  (a)  Agencies  making  suitability

agency, including: 

(i)  the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  conduct  resulting  in  the  criminal 
record,  including  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  conduct  and  contrib-

absence or presence of rehabilitation efforts; and 
(iii)  the  nature  of  the  occupation  requiring  a  license,  including  whether 
the  criminal  record  is  directly  related  to  the  occupation,  whether  the 
occupation  offers  the  opportunity  for  the  same  or  a  similar  offense  to 
occur,  and  whether  circumstances  leading  to  the  conviction  will  recur

Memorandum  of  March  1,  2016 

Limiting  the  Use  of  Restrictive  Housing  by  the  Federal  Gov-
ernment 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

A growing body of evidence suggests that the overuse of solitary confinement 
and  other  forms  of  restrictive  housing  in  U.S.  correctional  systems  under-
mines public safety and is contrary to our Nation’s values. 
In  July  2015,  as  part  of  my  Administration’s  ongoing  efforts  to  pursue 
reforms  that  make  the  criminal  justice  system  more  fair  and  effective,  I 
directed  the  Attorney  General  to  undertake  a  comprehensive  review  of  the 
overuse  of  solitary  confinement  across  American  prisons.  Since  that  time, 
senior  officials  at  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  have  met  regularly  to 
study  the  issue  and  develop  strategies  for  reducing  the  use  of  this  practice 
nationwide. 
Those  efforts  gave  rise  to  a  final  report  transmitted  to  me  on  January  25, 
2016  (DOJ  Report  and  Recommendations  Concerning  the  Use  of  Restrictive 
Housing) (the ‘‘DOJ Report’’), that sets forth specific policy recommendations 
for DOJ with respect to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and other DOJ entities 
as  well  as  more  general  guiding  principles  for  all  correctional  systems. 
As  the  DOJ  Report  makes  clear,  although  occasions  exist  when  correctional 
officials have no choice but to segregate inmates from the general population, 
this  action  has  the  potential  to  cause  serious,  long-lasting  harm.  The  DOJ 
Report  accordingly  emphasizes  the  responsibility  of  Government  to  ensure 
that  this  practice  is  limited,  applied  with  constraints,  and  used  only  as 
a measure of last resort. 
Given  the  urgency  and  importance  of  this  issue,  it  is  critical  that  DOJ 
accelerate  efforts  to  reduce  the  number  of  Federal  inmates  and  detainees 
held  in  restrictive  housing  and  that  Federal  correctional  and  detention  sys-
tems  be  models  for  facilities  across  the  United  States.  Therefore,  by  the 
authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of 
the United States of America, and to address the overuse of solitary confine-
ment  in  correctional  and  detention  systems  throughout  the  United  States, 
I hereby direct as follows: 
Section 1. Implementation of the DOJ Report. (a) DOJ shall promptly under-
take  to  revise  its  regulations  and  policies,  consistent  with  the  direction 
of  the  Attorney  General,  to  implement  the  policy  recommendations  in  the 
DOJ  Report  concerning  the  use  of  restrictive  housing.  DOJ  shall  provide 
me  with  an  update  on  the  status  of  these  efforts  not  later  than  180  days 
after the date of this memorandum. 

(b) Other executive departments and agencies (agencies) that impose restric-
tive housing shall review the DOJ Report to determine whether corresponding 
changes at their facilities should be made in light of the policy recommenda-
tions and guiding principles in the DOJ Report. 
These  other  agencies  shall  report  back  to  me  not  later  than  180  days  after 
the  date  of  this  memorandum  on  how  they  plan  to  address  their  use  of 
restrictive housing. 
Sec.  2.  General  Provisions.  (a)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented 
consistent  with  applicable  law  and  subject  to  the  availability  of  appropria-
tions.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Memorandum  of  January  4,  2016 

Promoting  Smart  Gun  Technology 

719 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Defense[,]  the  Attorney  General[,  and] 
the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security 

For  more  than  20  years,  the  Federal  Government  has  worked  to  keep  guns 
out  of  the  wrong  hands  through  background  checks.  This  critical  effort 
in  addressing  gun  violence  has  prevented  more  than  two  million  prohibited 
firearms  purchases  from  being  completed.  But  tens  of  thousands  of  people 
are  still  injured  or  killed  by  firearms  every  year—in  many  cases  by  guns 
that  were  sold  legally  but  then  stolen,  misused,  or  discharged  accidentally. 
Developing  and  promoting  technology  that  would  help  prevent  these  trage-
dies is an urgent priority. 
In  2013,  I  directed  the  Department  of  Justice  to  review  the  availability 
and  most  effective  use  of  new  gun  safety  technologies,  such  as  devices 
requiring  a  scan  of  the  owner’s  fingerprint  before  a  gun  can  fire.  In  its 
report,  the  Department  made  clear  that  technological  advancements  in  this 
area  could  help  reduce  accidental  deaths  and  the  use  of  stolen  guns  in 
criminal activities. 
Millions  of  dollars  have  already  been  invested  to  support  research  into 
a  broad  range  of  concepts  for  improving  gun  safety.  We  must  all  do  our 
part to continue to advance this research and encourage its practical applica-
tion,  and  it  is  possible  to  do  so  in  a  way  that  makes  the  public  safer 
and  is  consistent  with  the  Second  Amendment.  The  Federal  Government 
has  a  unique  opportunity  to  do  so,  as  it  is  the  single  largest  purchaser 
of  firearms  in  the  country.  Therefore,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as 
President  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America, 
I hereby direct the following: 
Section  1.  Research  and  Development.  The  Department  of  Defense,  the  De-
partment of Justice, and the Department of Homeland Security (departments) 
shall,  to  the  extent  practicable  and  permitted  by  law,  conduct  or  sponsor 
research  into  gun  safety  technology  that  would  reduce  the  frequency  of 
accidental discharge or unauthorized use of firearms, and improve the tracing 
of  lost  or  stolen  guns.  Not  later  than  90  days  after  the  date  of  this  memo-
randum,  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Attorney  General,  and  the  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  shall  prepare  jointly  a  report  outlining  a  research 
and  development  strategy  designed  to  expedite  the  real-world  deployment 
of such technology for use in practice. 
Sec. 2. Department Consideration of New Technology. The departments shall, 
to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  regularly  (a)  review  the  availability  of  the 
technology  described  in  section  1,  and  (b)  explore  potential  ways  to  further 
its use and development to more broadly improve gun safety. In connection 
with  these  efforts,  the  departments  shall  consult  with  other  agencies  that 
acquire  firearms  and  take  appropriate  steps  to  consider  whether  including 
such  technology  in  specifications  for  acquisition  of  firearms  would  be  con-
sistent with operational needs. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  a  department  or  agency,  or  the  head 
thereof; or

Notice  of  April  4,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Somalia 

On April 12, 2010, by Executive Order 13536, I declared a national emergency 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the deteriora-
tion  of  the  security  situation  and  the  persistence  of  violence  in  Somalia, 
acts  of  piracy  and  armed  robbery  at  sea  off  the  coast  of  Somalia,  which 
have repeatedly been the subject of United Nations Security Council resolu-
tions,  and  violations  of  the  arms  embargo  imposed  by  the  United  Nations 
Security Council. 
On  July  20,  2012,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13620  to  take  additional  steps 
to  deal  with  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13536, 
in  view  of  United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolution  2036  of  February 
22,  2012,  and  Resolution  2002  of  July  29,  2011,  and  to  address:  exports 
of charcoal from Somalia, which generate significant revenue for al-Shabaab; 
the  misappropriation  of  Somali  public  assets;  and  certain  acts  of  violence 
committed against civilians in Somalia, all of which contribute to the deterio-
ration  of  the  security  situation  and  the  persistence  of  violence  in  Somalia. 
Because  the  situation  with  respect  to  Somalia  continues  to  pose  an  unusual 
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the 
United  States,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  April  12,  2010,  and 
the  measures  adopted  on  that  date  and  on  July  20,  2012,  to  deal  with 
that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  April  12,  2016.  Therefore, 
in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50 
U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared 
in Executive Order 13536.

Proclamation  9475  of  August  22,  2016 

100th  Anniversary  of  the  National  Park  Service 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  1872,  the  Congress  established  Yellowstone  National  Park—the  first  park 
of  its  kind  anywhere  in  the  world.  Decades  later,  the  passage  of  the  Antiq-
uities  Act  in  1906  created  our  first  national  historic  preservation  policy. 
Under  this  new  authority,  and  heavily  inspired  by  his  time  in  nature  with 
conservationist  John  Muir,  President  Theodore  Roosevelt  set  aside  18  new 
monuments  and  landmarks,  adding  to  the  scattered  collection  of  existing 
parks  throughout  our  country.  One  decade  later,  in  order  to  provide  the 
leadership  necessary  for  maintaining  our  growing  system  of  parks,  the  Con-
gress  passed  monumental  legislation—which  President  Woodrow  Wilson 
signed  on  August  25,  1916—to  create  the  National  Park  Service  (NPS). 
All  existing  National  Parks  were  placed  under  the  management  of  the  NPS, 
ushering  in  a  new  era  of  conservation,  exploration,  and  discovery—and 
securing,  throughout  the  century  that  would  follow,  the  profound  legacy 
of an interconnected system of natural wonders. 
Over  the  course  of  the  past  100  years,  our  national  park  system  has  grown 
to  include  more  than  400  locations  across  our  country.  Ranging  from  sea-
shores to waterfalls, winding trails to rugged mountains, historic battlefields 
to monuments and memorials, every treasured site under the NPS is uniquely 
American.  Our  parks  play  a  critical  role  in  environmental  stewardship, 
ensuring  that  precious  wildlife  can  thrive  and  that  ecosystems  can  provide 
the  many  benefits  on  which  we  depend.  They  have  sustained  the  stories 
and  cultures  that  define  the  American  experience,  and  they  embody  the 
people and movements that distinguish our Nation’s journey. 
As  we  reflect  on  the  many  natural  and  cultural  gifts  that  our  National 
Parks  provide,  we  must  also  look  to  the  next  century  and  pledge  to  secure 
our  precious  resources.  That  is  why  my  Administration  has  protected  over 
265 million acres of public lands and waters—more than any Administration 
in  history—and  worked  to  save  endangered  and  vulnerable  species  and 
their  vital  habitats.  Climate  change  poses  the  biggest  threat  to  our  planet 
and  our  parks  and  is  already  dangerously  affecting  park  ecosystems  and 
visitor  experiences.  It  is  imperative  that  we  rise  to  meet  this  challenge 
and  continue  leading  the  global  fight  against  climate  change  to  ensure  that 
our parks remain healthy for all who will come after us. 
Often  called  ‘‘America’s  best  idea,’’  our  National  Parks  belong  to  Americans 
of  all  ages  and  backgrounds.  NPS  sites  and  their  recreational,  educational, 
and  public  health  benefits  are  our  American  birthright.  Last  year,  these 
sites  welcomed  more  than  300  million  visitors,  and  my  Administration 
is  committed  to  helping  all  our  people  access  and  enjoy  these  public  lands 
and  waters.  Through  our  ‘‘Every  Kid  in  a  Park’’  initiative,  we  have  made 
our  National  Parks  free  to  fourth  grade  students  and  their  families  so  that 
more  children,  from  any  community  or  walk  of  life,  can  spend  time  being 
active  in  our  outdoor  spaces  while  learning  about  these  natural  treasures— 
something  that  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  has  also  advocated  for  through 
her  Let’s  Move!  initiative.  And  through  the  Joining  Forces  initiative  that 
she  and  Dr.  Jill  Biden  have  championed,  more  of  our  troops  and  military 
families  can  enjoy  our  National  Parks.  We  must  expand  on  these  programs

and increase opportunities for people in underserved communities to experi-
ence  the  great  outdoors  as  well.  The  second  century  of  the  NPS  will  rely 
on  the  support  and  engagement  of  young  people  who  are  visiting  more 
parks  through  the  ‘‘Find  Your  Park’’  campaign,  and  we  must  encourage 
this  rising  generation  of  Americans  by  inviting  them  to  make  their  own 
personal connections to the places that have shaped our history. 
NPS  parks  and  programs  strive  to  tell  our  diverse  stories,  allowing  us  to 
learn  from  the  past  and  help  write  our  country’s  next  great  chapters.  In 
celebration  of  the  100th  anniversary  of  the  National  Park  Service,  let  us 
thank  all  those  who—through  their  dedication  to  the  mission  of  the  NPS— 
help  our  country  build  on  the  legacy  left  by  all  those  who  came  before 
us.  As  we  look  to  the  next  century  and  embrace  the  notion  that  preserving 
these  public  spaces  in  ways  that  engage,  reflect,  and  honor  all  Americans 
has  never  been  more  important,  let  us  summon  the  foresight  and  faith 
in the future to do what it takes to protect our National Parks for generations 
to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  August  25,  2016, 
as the 100th Anniversary of the National Park Service. I invite all Americans 
to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  programs,  ceremonies,  and  activities 
that  recognize  the  National  Park  Service  for  maintaining  and  protecting 
our  public  lands  for  the  continued  benefit  and  enjoyment  of  all  Americans. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-second

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9543  of  November  14,  2016 

America  Recycles  Day,  2016 

81639 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Having  only  one  planet  and  limited  natural  resources,  it  is  imperative  we 
reduce  our  environmental  impact—particularly  when  it  comes  to  waste. 
More  than  half  of  everything  we  throw  away  gets  permanently  discarded, 
packing  landfills  across  our  country  with  trash  that  can  take  centuries  to 
decompose  and  provides  no  utility.  Today,  we  resolve  to  raise  awareness 
of  the  important  role  that  reducing,  reusing,  and  recycling  can  play  in 
achieving a more sustainable future. 
Recycling is a process that allows materials that would otherwise be thrown 
out  to  be  manufactured  into  new  materials  that  can  be  used  again.  By 
decreasing  landfill  waste  and  conserving  important  natural  resources,  recy-
cling  can  mitigate  pollution,  save  energy,  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions.  Many  items  such  as  paper,  plastics,  and  batteries  are  commonly 
known  to  be  recyclable,  but  many  other  products—including  oil  and  tires— 
can  also  be  recycled.  In  addition  to  helping  reduce  our  environmental  foot-
print, recycling also strengthens our economy and creates hundreds of thou-
sands  of  green  jobs.  To  learn  more  about  what  can  be  recycled  and  ways 
to encourage recycling in your community, visit www.EPA.gov/Recycle. 
People  of  all  ages  can  do  their  part  by  reducing  waste  and  reusing  items. 
In  our  homes  we  can  compost  food  and  yard  waste  rather  than  sending 
it  to  a  landfill;  in  schools  we  can  utilize  reusable  containers  for  storing 
lunches  and  school  supplies;  and  in  workplaces  we  can  print  more  docu-
ments  double-sided  and  on  recycled  paper,  or  opt  for  digital  copies  rather 
than  printing  in  the  first  place.  The  Federal  Government  is  doing  our  part 
to  lead  by  example—from  helping  businesses  purchase  recycled  materials 
to  assisting  grocery  stores,  schools,  and  stadiums  with  reducing  their  food 
waste,  we  are  striving  to  give  businesses,  States,  and  local  governments 
the resources they need to encourage recycling across our Nation. 
One  of  the  most  important  things  we  can  do  with  our  time  on  Earth  is 
to  make  it  better  for  future  generations.  On  America  Recycles  Day,  we 
renew  our  commitment  to  making  environmentally  conscious  changes  in 
our lives so that our children and grandchildren can live that better, cleaner 
future.  Let  us  continue  striving  to  reduce  waste,  conserve  resources,  and 
meet our obligations to our planet and to future generations. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  15,  2016, 
as  America  Recycles  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to 
observe  this  day  with  appropriate  programs  and  activities,  and  I  encourage 
all  Americans  to  continue  their  reducing,  reusing,  and  recycling  efforts 
throughout the year.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9540  of  November  10,  2016 

American  Education  Week,  2016 

80983 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
With  great  potential  to  prepare  our  young  people  for  the  world  they  will 
inherit  and  lead,  education  provides  one  of  the  most  essential  foundations 
for  prosperity  and  opportunity,  strengthening  our  democracy  and  civic  life 
and  serving  as  a  pathway  to  economic  success.  It  helps  cultivate  passion 
and  inspire  young  people  to  build  and  create;  analyze  and  discover;  under-
stand  and  empathize  with  the  people  around  them,  and  through  education, 
students  can  form  a  deeper  understanding  of  history  and  society,  literature 
and  languages,  and  how  things  work  and  why  they  do.  During  American 
Education  Week,  we  recognize  the  importance  of  education  and  renew  our 
commitment  to  bringing  a  better  education  within  reach  for  all  our  people. 
America’s  high  school  graduation  rate  is  now  the  highest  ever  recorded, 
and  the  hard  work  people  across  our  country  have  put  in  is  paying  off. 
States have set higher, better standards to help us out-teach and out-compete 
other  nations.  Teachers  are  going  that  extra  mile  to  create  meaningful  and 
memorable  lessons,  rather  than  merely  teaching  to  a  test,  and  we  have 
given  them  more  flexibility  to  do  so  through  the  Every  Student  Succeeds 
Act—a  bipartisan  bill  I  signed  last  year  to  improve  schools,  give  State 
and  local  lawmakers  more  control,  and  target  resources  to  where  they  are 
needed  most.  But  across  our  country,  there  are  unfortunately  still  too  many 
places  where  we  can  do  far  better  for  our  students.  Too  many  schools 
are  underfunded  and  lack  the  resources  or  structures  they  need  to  prepare 
students  for  success,  and  for  far  too  many  students,  their  zip  codes  still 
determine how far they can go. 
From  strengthening  high-quality  early  education  and  preschool  to  bolstering 
access  to  higher  education,  my  Administration  has  made  improving  our 
education  system  a  priority  for  our  students  from  their  first  days  of  school 
to  the  days  they  start  their  careers.  Nobody  should  be  priced  out  of  a 
higher  education,  so  we  are  striving  to  make  college  more  affordable  and 
provide  2  years  of  free  community  college  for  any  student  willing  to  work 
for  it.  We  also  reformed  the  student  loan  system  and  expanded  Pell  grants 
to  more  students.  The  demands  of  our  global  economy  and  changing  tech-
nology  require  students  to  learn  real-world  skills  such  as  computer  science 
in  the  classroom,  so  we  are  bringing  new  technology  and  digital  tools, 
including high-speed internet, into classrooms to modernize education. And 
because  too  many  girls,  young  people  of  color,  and  low-income  students 
are not encouraged and underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, 
and  math  (STEM)  courses  and  careers,  we  are  investing  in  ways  to  broaden 
STEM participation as well as working to train more STEM teachers. 
Empowering  students  of  all  ages,  backgrounds,  and  beliefs  to  challenge 
themselves  to  reach  higher,  education  can  lift  up  a  generation,  allowing 
them  to  carry  the  torch  of  progress  forward  and  make  our  world  a  better 
place.  This  week,  let  us  recommit  to  the  important  work  that  remains  and 
ensure  every  student  in  America  can  access  the  support,  resources,  and 
opportunities they need to thrive. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9391  of  January  29,  2016 

American  Heart  Month,  2016 

5875 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Affecting  people  of  all  races  and  ethnicities,  cardiovascular  disease  is  the 
single  leading  cause  of  death  for  both  men  and  women  in  the  United 
States,  responsible  for  one  in  three  deaths  in  the  United  States  each  year. 
Though  usually  preventable,  heart  disease  can  manifest  itself  in  sudden 
and unforeseen ways, and it costs our Nation hundreds of billions of dollars 
annually.  During  American  Heart  Month,  we  remember  those  we  have  lost 
to  this  devastating  disease,  promote  healthy  lifestyles  that  mitigate  its  im-
pacts, and pledge to continue our fight against it. 
Heart  disease  must  be  addressed  with  urgency.  Every  person  can  take  steps 
to  reduce  the  risk  factors  associated  with  heart  disease  in  themselves  and 
in  those  they  care  about—whether  as  parents,  caretakers,  or  friends—by 
encouraging  healthy  eating,  physical  activity,  and  by  discouraging  the  use 
of tobacco. Almost half of all Americans face increased risk of heart disease 
for  reasons  that  include  being  a  smoker,  having  high  blood  pressure,  or 
having  high  cholesterol.  You  can  reduce  your  chances  of  developing  heart 
disease by reducing alcohol intake, exercising regularly, maintaining a nutri-
tious  diet,  living  tobacco-free,  and  staying  aware  of  early  warning  signs. 
For more resources and information, visit www.CDC.gov/HeartDisease. 
Testing  cholesterol  levels  for  individuals  particularly  vulnerable  to  heart 
disease  and  checking  blood  pressure  regularly  are  both  critical  preventive 
measures  for  detecting  heart  disease  early  on,  and  thanks  to  the  Affordable 
Care  Act,  tens  of  millions  of  Americans  now  have  access  to  recommended 
preventive  services  for  free.  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama’s  Let’s  Move!  initia-
tive  is  working  to  reduce  obesity—another  primary  contributing  factor  to 
cardiovascular  issues—among  children  to  offset  their  susceptibility  to  heart 
disease and other obesity-related health problems. Additionally, my Adminis-
tration  launched  Million  Hearts  5  years  ago,  a  national  initiative  aimed 
at  preventing  1  million  heart  attacks  and  strokes  by  2017.  Moving  forward, 
we  will  continue  to  invest  in  research  that  helps  target  medical  treatments 
and  gives  all  of  us  access  to  the  personalized  information  we  need  to 
keep ourselves and our families healthy. 
Michelle  and  I  encourage  everyone  to  participate  in  National  Wear  Red 
Day  on  Friday,  February  5,  by  wearing  red  in  honor  of  those  we  have 
lost  to  heart  disease  and  to  raise  awareness  of  this  devastating  disease 
and  the  steps  we  can  all  take  to  prevent  it.  Every  43  seconds,  someone 
in  the  United  States  suffers  a  heart  attack,  and  many  of  them  are  fatal. 
Combating heart disease is imperative for improving public health in Amer-
ica,  and  together,  we  can  work  to  ensure  everybody  knows  its  signs  and 
symptoms and can access needed care. This month, let us renew our efforts 
to raise awareness of this disease and its consequences, and let us recommit 
to building a healthier, heartier future for all. 
In  acknowledgment  of  the  importance  of  the  ongoing  fight  against  cardio-
vascular  disease,  the  Congress,  by  Joint  Resolution  approved  December  30, 
1963,  as  amended  (77  Stat.  843;  36  U.S.C.  101),  has  requested  that  the 
President  issue  an  annual  proclamation  designating  February  as  ‘‘American 
Heart Month.’’

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9399  of  February  29,  2016 

The  President 

American  Red  Cross  Month,  2016 

11091 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Over  a  century  and  a  half  ago,  as  gunfire  echoed  through  America’s  skies 
and  division  flared  between  North  and  South,  a  trailblazing  woman,  Clara 
Barton, braved bullets and cannon fire to deliver much-needed care, comfort, 
and  supplies  to  wounded  soldiers  of  the  Civil  War.  Undaunted  by  expecta-
tions  of  women  at  the  time,  Clara  Barton  persevered,  as  she  had  her  whole 
life,  and  strived  to  aid  those  who  sacrificed  to  save  our  Union.  Determined 
that humanitarianism could thrive in peace as well as in conflict, she carried 
her  resolve  overseas  upon  the  war’s  end  and  was  introduced  to  a  relief 
organization  in  Europe  that  inspired  her  to  come  home  to  the  United  States 
and establish the American Red Cross. 
Today,  supporters,  volunteers,  and  employees  of  the  American  Red  Cross 
reflect  the  best  of  our  Nation’s  spirit—responding  to  tens  of  thousands 
of  tragedies  here  at  home  each  year  and  bringing  relief  and  assistance  to 
suffering  individuals  across  the  globe.  In  the  last  year,  countless  people 
from  the  American  Red  Cross  and  many  other  service  organizations  have 
served  on  the  front  lines  of  disaster  and  done  the  hard  work  of  improving 
our country and our world, never asking for credit or glory, fame or fortune. 
From  floods  that  ravaged  the  plains  of  the  Midwest  and  the  coastlines 
of  South  Carolina,  to  wildfires  that  scorched  California,  and  an  earthquake 
that  devastated  Nepal,  the  American  Red  Cross  has  distributed  almost  one 
million  relief  items  and  provided  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  in  assistance 
to victims. And when an influx of migrants from Syria stretched the capacities 
of  countries  around  the  world,  the  American  Red  Cross  deployed  tens  of 
thousands  of  volunteers  across  the  Atlantic  to  provide  medical  care  and 
essential  resources.  These  selfless  heroes  inspire  hope  and  offer  help  to 
those  in  need,  and  as  stalwarts  in  our  communities,  they  build  individual 
resilience and safeguard our blood supply. 
The  spirit  of  resilience  and  service  that  drives  our  people  in  the  wake 
of  tragedy  is  what  makes  us  an  anchor  of  global  strength  and  stability. 
When  hardship  strikes,  countries  around  the  world  look  to  our  Nation  for 
help,  and  the  American  Red  Cross  and  similar  organizations  demonstrate 
what  is  possible  when  compassionate  people  come  together  to  uphold  the 
basic  values  that  define  America—that  we  are  each  other’s  keepers  and 
that  we  all  must  accept  our  obligations  to  one  another.  This  month,  let 
us  be  guided  by  the  truth  that  we  all  share  a  similar  destiny,  and  let 
us  support  organizations  that  work  to  lift  up  the  lives  of  our  planet’s  most 
vulnerable  people.  Together,  we  can  give  everyone  a  place  to  turn  in  times 
of crisis and uncertainty. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America  and  Honorary  Chairman  of  the  American  Red  Cross,  by  virtue 
of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the 
United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2016  as  American  Red  Cross 
Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month  with  appropriate 
programs,  ceremonies,  and  activities,  and  by  supporting  the  work  of  service 
and relief organizations.

Proclamation  9471  of  July  25,  2016 

Anniversary  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  July  26,  1990,  our  Nation  marked  a  pivotal  moment  in  history  for 
Americans  with  disabilities.  Fueled  by  a  chorus  of  voices  who  refused 
to  accept  a  second-class  status  and  driven  by  a  movement  that  recognized 
that  our  country  is  stronger  and  more  vibrant  when  we  draw  on  the  talents 
of  all  our  people,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  enshrined 
into law the notion that Americans living with disabilities deserve to partici-
pate  in  our  society  free  from  discrimination.  Twenty-six  years  later,  as 
we  mark  this  anniversary,  we  recognize  all  this  milestone  law  has  made 
possible for the disability community. 
The  ADA  sought  to  guarantee  that  the  places  we  share—from  schools  and 
workplaces  to  stadiums  and  parks—truly  belong  to  everyone.  It  reflects 
our  Nation’s  full  commitment  to  the  rights  and  independence  of  people 
with  disabilities,  and  it  has  paved  the  way  for  a  more  inclusive  and  equal 
society.  For  the  6.5  million  students  and  the  approximately  50  million 
adults  living  with  mental  or  physical  disabilities,  the  ADA  has  swung  open 
doors  and  empowered  each  of  them  to  make  of  their  lives  what  they  will. 
Building  on  this  progress  is  a  priority  for  my  Administration.  The  Federal 
Government has taken the lead in creating meaningful employment opportu-
nities  for  people  with  disabilities.  In  my  first  term,  I  issued  an  Executive 
Order  that  called  on  Federal  agencies  and  contractors  to  hire  more  people 
with  disabilities—and  today,  more  Americans  with  disabilities  are  working 
in Federal service than at any time in the last three decades. My Administra-
tion  has  vigorously  enforced  the  Supreme  Court’s  ruling  in  the  Olmstead 
decision—which  determined  that,  under  the  ADA,  people  with  disabilities 
cannot  be  unnecessarily  segregated—and  worked  to  deliver  on  the  promise 
that individuals with disabilities have access to integrated, community-based 
services.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  affirmed  that  Americans  with  pre-existing 
conditions  can  no  longer  be  denied  health  insurance,  and  this  year,  we 
made  it  clear  that  health  care  providers  must  offer  reasonable  accommoda-
tions  and  ensure  effective  communication  for  individuals  with  disabilities 
in order to advance health equity and reduce health care disparities. 
As we commemorate this progress, we know our work to expand opportunity 
and  confront  the  stigma  that  persists  surrounding  disabilities  is  not  yet 
finished:  We  have  to  address  the  injustices  that  linger  and  remove  the 
barriers that remain. Too many people with disabilities are still unemployed 
and  lack  access  to  skills  training  or  are  not  paid  fairly  for  their  work. 
We  must  continue  increasing  graduation  rates  for  students  with  disabilities 
to  give  them  every  chance  to  receive  the  education  and  training  they  need 
to  pursue  their  dreams.  We  must  make  the  information  and  communication 
technologies  we  rely  on  accessible  for  all  people,  and  ensure  their  needs 
are  considered  and  incorporated  as  we  advance  the  tools  of  modern  life. 
And  we  must  keep  fighting  for  more  consistent  and  effective  enforcement 
of the ADA in order to prevent discrimination in public services and accom-
modations. 
At  a  time  when  so  many  doubted  that  people  with  disabilities  could  con-
tribute  to  our  economy  or  support  their  families,  the  ADA  assumed  they

and  commitment  of  all  who  made  this  achievement  possible,  let  us  renew 
our  obligation  to  extend  the  promise  of  the  American  dream  to  all  our 
people, and let us recommit to building a world free of unnecessary barriers 
and full of deeper understanding of those living with disabilities. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  July  26,  2016,  the 
Anniversary  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act.  I  encourage  Americans 
across  our  Nation  to  celebrate  the  26th  anniversary  of  this  civil  rights  law 
and the many contributions of individuals with disabilities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-fifth 
day  of  July,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9452  of  May  20,  2016 

Armed  Forces  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen who comprise 
our  Armed  Forces  have  defended  our  Nation  and  the  values  for  which 
we  stand  for  generations,  answering  the  call  to  give  up  the  comforts  of 
civilian  life,  do  whatever  it  takes  to  keep  us  safe,  and  go  wherever  they 
are  needed.  On  Armed  Forces  Day,  we  offer  our  most  profound  gratitude 
to  the  patriots—at  home  and  abroad—who  have  risked  their  lives  so  our 
people can live knowing the fullest measure of freedom and security. 
With  courage  and  honor,  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  embody  the 
everlasting  responsibility  we  have  to  each  other  and  to  future  generations 
by  giving  of  themselves  to  ensure  the  preservation  of  our  Republic  and 
secure  peace  throughout  the  world.  It  is  because  of  them  and  the  values 
they  represent  that  people  across  the  globe  look  to  the  United  States  of 
America  in  moments  of  desperation  and  despair.  For  the  relief  they  offer, 
the  stability  they  provide,  and  the  hope  they  inspire,  we  owe  our  service 
members  an  extraordinary  debt—one  we  will  never  stop  working  to  repay. 
Our  country’s  strength  is  measured  by  how  we  support  and  take  care  of 
our  troops.  Humbled  by  the  sacrifices  they  make—and  by  the  strength  of 
their  families—we  stand  in  support  of  those  who  don  our  uniform  and 
strive  to  ensure  they  have  every  opportunity  to  pursue  the  American  dream 
they  defend.  They  give  their  best  for  America,  and  they  deserve  the  best 
from  us.  On  this  day,  let  us  salute  these  brave  Americans  and  all  those 
who  laid  down  their  lives  for  our  safety,  and  each  day,  let  us  remember 
that we live knowing liberty because of our Armed Forces. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  and  Commander  in  Chief  of  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United 
States,  continuing  the  precedent  of  my  predecessors  in  office,  do  hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day. 
I  direct  the  Secretary  of  Defense  on  behalf  of  the  Army,  Navy,  Air  Force, 
and  Marine  Corps,  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  on  behalf  of 
the  Coast  Guard,  to  plan  for  appropriate  observances  each  year,  with  the 
Secretary  of  Defense  responsible  for  encouraging  the  participation  and  co-
operation of civil authorities and private citizens. 
I invite the Governors of the United States and its Territories, and appropriate 
officials  of  all  units  of  government,  to  provide  for  the  observance  of  Armed 
Forces  Day  within  their  jurisdiction  each  year  in  an  appropriate  manner 
designed  to  increase  public  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the  Armed 
Forces of the United States. I also invite veterans, civic leaders, and organiza-
tions to join in the observance of Armed Forces Day. 
Finally,  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States 
at  their  homes  on  Armed  Forces  Day,  and  I  urge  citizens  to  learn  more 
about military service by attending and participating in the local observances 
of  the  day.  I  also  encourage  Americans  to  volunteer  at  organizations  that 
provide support to our troops and their families. 
Proclamation 9283 of May 15, 2015, is hereby superseded.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9554  of  December  14,  2016 

Bill  of  Rights  Day,  2016 

92497 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
After much debate and deliberation among the Framers, the first 10 Amend-
ments  to  our  Constitution  were  written  to  reflect  a  compromise  between 
preserving  the  rights  of  individual  citizens  and  supporting  a  strong  and 
secure  Federal  Government.  Since  its  ratification  on  December  15,  1791, 
the  Bill  of  Rights  has  enshrined  many  of  our  most  fundamental  liberties 
and  unalienable  rights—including  the  freedoms  of  speech,  worship,  and 
assembly;  the  rights  to  trial  by  jury  and  due  process,  and  the  protections 
from  unreasonable  search  and  seizure  and  cruel  and  unusual  punishment. 
For  225  years,  the  Bill  of  Rights  has  shaped  our  Nation  and  protected 
our  citizens,  and  today,  in  honor  of  all  those  who  have  worked  to  secure 
these  freedoms,  we  strive  to  continue  forming  a  more  perfect  Union  guided 
by an enduring belief in these highest ideals. 
As it was originally created, the Bill of Rights safeguarded personal liberties 
and  ensured  equal  justice  under  the  law  for  many—but  not  for  all.  In 
the  centuries  that  followed  its  ratification,  courageous  Americans  agitated 
and  sacrificed  to  extend  these  rights  to  more  people,  moving  us  closer 
to  ensuring  opportunity  and  equality  are  not  limited  by  one’s  race,  sex, 
or  circumstances.  The  desire  and  capacity  to  forge  our  own  destinies  have 
propelled  us  forward  at  every  turn  in  history.  The  same  principles  that 
drove  patriots  to  choose  revolution  over  tyranny,  a  country  to  cast  off  the 
stains  of  slavery,  women  to  reach  for  the  ballot,  and  workers  to  organize 
for  their  rights  still  remind  us  that  our  freedom  is  intertwined  with  the 
freedom  of  others.  If  we  are  to  ensure  the  sacred  ideals  embodied  in  the 
Bill  of  Rights  are  afforded  to  everyone,  each  generation  must  do  what  those 
who  came  before  them  have  done  and  recommit  to  holding  fast  to  our 
values and protecting these freedoms. 
Two  and  a  quarter  centuries  later,  these  10  Constitutional  Amendments 
remain  a  symbol  of  one  of  our  Nation’s  first  successful  steps  in  our  journey 
to  uphold  the  rights  of  all  citizens.  On  Bill  of  Rights  Day,  we  celebrate 
the  long  arc  of  progress  that  transformed  our  Nation  from  a  fledgling  and 
fragile  democracy  to  one  in  which  civil  rights  are  the  birthright  of  all 
Americans. This progress was never inevitable, and as long as people remain 
willing  to  fight  for  justice,  we  can  work  to  swing  open  more  doors  of 
opportunity and carry forward a vision of liberty and equality for generations 
to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  December  15,  2016, 
as  Bill  of  Rights  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  mark 
this observance with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9525  of  October  14,  2016 

Blind  Americans  Equality  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Each  day,  blind  and  visually  impaired  Americans  contribute  to  our  society, 
refusing  to  allow  anything  to  hold  them  back.  In  order  to  ensure  more 
Americans  with  disabilities  can  continue  participating  fully  in  our  country, 
we  must  each  do  our  part  to  promote  equal  opportunity  for  all.  On  Blind 
Americans  Equality  Day,  we  reaffirm  the  inherent  dignity  of  every  human 
being  and  recommit  to  forging  a  future  in  which  all  Americans,  including 
those  with  visual  impairments,  can  pursue  their  full  measure  of  happiness. 
More  than  two  decades  ago,  one  of  the  most  comprehensive  civil  rights 
bills  in  our  history,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  was  signed 
into law. Ever since, the ADA has helped reduce discrimination and promote 
equal access to classrooms, workplaces, and transportation—and it is impera-
tive  that  we  build  on  the  significant  progress  we  have  made  for  individuals 
living  with  disabilities.  Because  the  unemployment  rate  is  more  than  twice 
as  high  for  Americans  with  disabilities,  my  Administration  has  worked 
to improve employment opportunities, including within the Federal Govern-
ment  where  we  are  leading  as  a  model  employer.  Last  year,  we  hosted 
the  White  House  Summit  on  Disability  and  Employment,  which  provided 
resources  to  help  employers  hire  more  individuals  with  disabilities.  And 
through the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, we expanded access 
to  critical  services  for  many  individuals  with  disabilities,  including  those 
who  are  blind  or  visually  impaired,  so  that  they  can  pursue  high-quality 
employment  opportunities.  People  with  disabilities  deserve  to  live  their 
lives  in  their  communities  and  raise  their  families,  and  earlier  this  year 
we  hosted  a  Forum  on  the  Civil  Rights  of  Parents  with  Disabilities  because 
every  family,  including  those  headed  by  people  with  disabilities,  deserves 
the chance to reach for a future of ever greater possibility. 
Our  Nation  must  continue  to  promote  equal  opportunity  and  the  right  of 
all  Americans  to  live  full  and  independent  lives.  This  begins  early  on— 
we  must  ensure  that  any  child  with  a  print  disability  can  access  the  tools 
they  need  to  pursue  an  education.  That  is  why  we  have  worked  to  provide 
appropriate  materials  and  services,  including  Braille  and  Braille  literacy 
instruction, in schools. We are investing in technologies that provide visually 
impaired  students  equal  access  to  the  general  education  curriculum.  We 
are  also  working  to  make  the  websites  of  Government  agencies  and  private 
companies  more  accessible  to  anyone  with  a  disability—an  effort  which 
remains  an  important  priority.  And  I  have  encouraged  the  Senate  to  ratify 
the  Marrakesh  Treaty  to  Facilitate  Access  to  Published  Works  for  Persons 
Who  Are  Blind,  Visually  Impaired,  or  Otherwise  Print  Disabled,  which  will 
broaden access to a new world of knowledge for these individuals. 
Disability  touches  us  all,  and  together  we  can  strive  to  ensure  that  all 
blind  and  visually  impaired  individuals  face  no  unnecessary  barriers  to 
success. By providing equal access to resources and technologies and giving 
everyone  the  chance  to  make  of  their  lives  what  they  will,  we  can  continue

Proclamation  9469  of  July  18,  2016 

Captive  Nations  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  our  earliest  days,  the  United  States  has  worked  to  uphold  the  rights 
enshrined in our founding documents. The ideals that sparked our revolution 
find  their  truest  expression  in  democracy,  and  our  enduring  belief  in  the 
right  to  self-govern  is  not  limited  to  our  borders—we  believe  the  human 
impulse  toward  freedom  is  universal.  During  Captive  Nations  Week,  we 
recognize  the  inherent  dignity  of  all  people,  and  we  renew  our  support 
for  those  struggling  under  oppressive  regimes  and  striving  to  secure  the 
blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity. 
After World War II, America joined with other nations to remake the world— 
to  rebuild,  to  forge  a  new  international  order,  and  to  advance  a  more  just 
and  lasting  peace.  And  following  a  decades-long  Cold  War,  with  strength 
and  resolve  and  the  power  of  our  ideals,  we  rejoiced  as  an  Iron  Curtain 
was  brought  down  and  a  new  beginning  was  set  in  motion.  But  although 
more  people  live  in  democracies  today—and  despite  the  fact  that  we  are 
witness  to  the  most  peaceful  and  prosperous  era  in  human  history—such 
progress  is  not  inevitable,  and  dangerous  forces  threaten  to  pull  the  world 
backward. 
We  must  bolster  our  commitment  to  upholding  freedom  and  democracy 
wherever  they  are  jeopardized.  That  means  ensuring  the  people  of  Ukraine 
have  the  right  to  choose  their  own  destiny  and  ensure  their  independence; 
it  means  helping  the  millions  of  those  displaced  from  Syria  seek  a  better 
and  safer  future,  while  continuing  our  efforts  to  bring  an  end  to  this  brutal 
conflict  and  destroy  ISIL.  It  also  means  discussing  our  differences  with 
nations more directly. And we have opened a new chapter in our relationship 
with  Cuba,  which  includes  direct  engagement  with  their  government  on 
human  rights  and  steps  to  empower  and  create  opportunity  for  the  Cuban 
people. 
Around  the  world,  a  new  generation  of  young  people—connected  by  tech-
nology  and  driven  by  idealism  and  a  willingness  to  stand  up  for  their 
beliefs—is  calling  for  more  accountability  in  government.  As  heirs  to  a 
struggle  for  freedom  that  has  long  defined  our  character,  Americans  must 
lead  by  example  and  chart  new  paths  to  liberty  and  opportunity.  We  will 
continue to stand for equality and dignity beyond our borders and encourage 
economic and political reforms that foster democracy. And we remain dedi-
cated  to  leading  and  working  with  others  to  build  security,  prosperity, 
and  justice,  and  to  fighting  for  any  person  still  suffering  under  the  grasp 
of tyranny. 
This  week,  let  us  rededicate  ourselves  to  broadening  democracy’s  reach 
and  promoting  its  true  pillars—the  rule  of  law,  fair  elections,  a  free  press, 
and  a  vibrant  civil  society.  As  we  work  to  lift  up  the  lives  of  those  whose 
governments still rule by fear and intimidation, let us stay vigilant in defense 
of democratic values and the ideals that keep us free. 
The  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  approved  July  17,  1959  (73  Stat.  212), 
has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to  issue  a  proclamation  desig-
nating  the  third  week  of  July  of  each  year  as  ‘‘Captive  Nations  Week.’’

Proclamation  9520  of  October  7,  2016 

Columbus  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

In October of 1492, Christopher Columbus completed the first of his expedi-
tions  that  would  land  him  on  the  shores  of  North  America.  Sponsored 
by  Isabella  I  and  Ferdinand  II,  Columbus  embarked  on  a  10-week  voyage 
he  had  hoped  would  lead  to  Asia.  But  when  his  ships  instead  landed 
in  the  Bahamas,  a  new  story  began  to  unfold.  The  spirit  of  exploration 
that  Columbus  embodied  was  sustained  by  all  who  would  follow  him  west-
ward,  driving  a  desire  to  continue  expanding  our  understanding  of  the 
world. 

Though  Columbus  departed  from  the  coast  of  Spain,  his  roots  traced  back 
to  his  birthplace  of  Genoa,  Italy.  Blazing  a  trail  for  generations  of  Italian 
explorers  and  Italian  Americans  to  eventually  seek  the  promise  of  the  New 
World,  his  voyage  churned  the  gears  of  history.  The  bonds  between  Italy 
and  the  United  States  could  not  be  closer  than  they  are  today—a  reflection 
of the extraordinary contributions made by both our peoples in our common 
efforts to shape a better future. Across our Nation, Italian Americans continue 
to enrich our country’s traditions and culture. 

As  we  mark  this  rich  history,  we  must  also  acknowledge  the  pain  and 
suffering  reflected  in  the  stories  of  Native  Americans  who  had  long  resided 
on  this  land  prior  to  the  arrival  of  European  newcomers.  The  past  we 
share is marked by too many broken promises, as well as violence, depriva-
tion,  and  disease.  It  is  a  history  that  we  must  recognize  as  we  seek  to 
build  a  brighter  future—side  by  side  and  with  cooperation  and  mutual 
respect.  We  have  made  great  progress  together  in  recent  years,  and  we 
will keep striving to maintain strong nation-to-nation relationships, strength-
en tribal sovereignty, and help all our communities thrive. 

More  than  five  centuries  ago,  one  journey  changed  the  trajectory  of  our 
world—and today we recognize the spirit that Christopher Columbus’s legacy 
inspired.  As  we  reflect  on  the  adventurers  throughout  history  who  charted 
new  courses  and  sought  new  heights,  let  us  remember  the  communities 
who  suffered,  and  let  us  pay  tribute  to  our  heritage  and  embrace  the 
multiculturalism that defines the American experience. 

In  commemoration  of  Christopher  Columbus’s  historic  voyage  524  years 
ago,  the  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  of  April  30,  1934,  and  modified  in 
1968  (36  U.S.C.  107),  as  amended,  has  requested  the  President  proclaim 
the second Monday of October of each year as ‘‘Columbus Day.’’ 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  10,  2016,  as  Columbus  Day.  I 
call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate 
ceremonies  and  activities.  I  also  direct  that  the  flag  of  the  United  States 
be  displayed  on  all  public  buildings  on  the  appointed  day  in  honor  of 
our  diverse  history  and  all  who  have  contributed  to  shaping  this  Nation.

Proclamation  9410  of  March  30,  2016 

Ce´sar  Cha´vez  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

As  a  child  of  migrant  workers  who  struggled  just  to  get  by,  Ce´sar  Cha´vez 
knew  the  importance  of  having  an  economy  that  works  for  everyone  and 
devoted  his  life  to  ensuring  our  Nation  upheld  the  values  upon  which 
it  was  founded.  On  his  birthday,  we  celebrate  a  man  who  reminded  us— 
above  all  else—that  we  all  share  a  common  humanity,  each  of  us  having 
our  own  value  and  contributing  to  the  same  destiny,  and  we  carry  forward 
his  legacy  by  echoing  his  peaceful  and  eloquent  calls  for  a  more  just  and 
equal society. 

Ce´sar  Cha´vez  demonstrated  that  true  courage  is  revealed  when  the  outlook 
is  darkest,  the  resistance  is  strongest,  and  we  still  find  it  within  ourselves 
to  stand  up  for  what  we  believe  in.  In  the  face  of  extraordinary  adversity 
and  opposition,  he  stood  up  for  the  inherent  dignity  of  every  person,  no 
matter  their  race,  color,  creed,  or  sexual  orientation,  and  for  the  idea  that 
when  workers  are  treated  fairly,  we  give  meaning  to  our  founding  ideals. 
Guided  by  his  faith  in  his  convictions,  he  fasted,  marched,  and  rallied 
millions  to  ‘‘La  Causa’’  to  expand  opportunity  and  demand  a  voice  for 
workers  everywhere.  Together  with  Dolores  Huerta,  he  founded  the  United 
Farm  Workers,  and  through  boycotts  and  protests,  he  ushered  in  a  new 
era of respect for America’s laborers and farm workers. 

Today,  we  honor  Ce´sar  Cha´vez  by  continuing  to  fight  for  what  he  believed 
in,  including  a  living  wage  for  workers  and  their  right  to  unionize  and 
provide  for  their  family.  Workers  should  have  a  safe  workplace  and  the 
comfort  of  knowing  that  if  they  work  hard,  they  can  feed  their  family, 
earn  decent  benefits,  and  gain  the  skills  they  need  to  move  up  and  get 
ahead.  We  will  also  keep  up  our  efforts  to  reform  our  Nation’s  broken 
immigration system so more people can contribute to our country’s success. 
And  as  we  strive  for  well-deserved  policies  for  America’s  workers,  like 
a higher minimum wage and paid leave, we are reminded that the movement 
Ce´sar  Cha´vez  led  was  sustained  by  a  generation  of  organizers  who  spoke 
out  and  fought  for  a  better,  fairer  America—and  it  is  now  upon  us  to 
do the same in our time. 

Our Nation’s progress has always been driven by the belief that extraordinary 
things happen when we come together around a common cause, and through 
decades of organizing and serving others, Ce´sar Cha´vez embodied this ideal. 
On  Ce´sar  Cha´vez  Day,  let  us  unite  to  reach  for  the  America  he  knew 
was  possible—one  in  which  hard  work  is  rewarded,  prosperity  is  shared, 
and equal opportunity is the right of all our people. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  31,  2016, 
as  Ce´sar  Cha´vez  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  day  with 
appropriate  service,  community,  and  education  programs  to  honor  Ce´sar 
Cha´vez’s enduring legacy.

Proclamation  9426  of  April  21,  2016 

Earth  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  April  22,  1970,  millions  of  people  from  every  corner  of  our  country 
joined in common cause to demand basic protections to safeguard our planet 
for  future  generations.  The  first  Earth  Day  helped  transform  the  ways  we 
interact with the world around us, and it changed how we view our impact 
on the natural world—inspiring the creation of the Environmental Protection 
Agency  and  landmark  legislation  that  protects  the  air  we  breathe,  the  water 
we  drink,  and  the  animals  that  live  alongside  us.  Today,  we  resolve  to 
build on the progress made in the nearly half-century since, and we reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  leaving  a  clean,  healthy  Earth  for  our  children  and 
grandchildren. 
Just  as  the  people  who  came  together  on  Earth  Day  in  1970  embraced 
their  responsibility  to  preserve  our  planet,  today  we  face  a  threat  that  also 
requires  collective  action.  Human  activity  is  disrupting  the  climate,  and 
the challenge of combating climate change is one that will define the contours 
of  our  time.  The  effects  of  climate  change  are  already  evident  in  stronger 
storms,  deeper  droughts,  more  rapidly  eroding  soil,  and  longer  wildfire 
seasons—and  as  of  last  year,  14  of  the  15  warmest  years  on  record  have 
occurred  since  2000.  This  urgent  threat  will  worsen  with  each  passing 
year unless we act now. 
No  country  can  solve  this  challenge  alone.  This  Earth  Day,  nations  from 
across  the  globe  are  gathering  in  New  York  to  sign  an  agreement  reached 
by  nearly  200  countries  in  Paris  late  last  year  that  establishes  an  enduring 
framework  to  reduce  global  carbon  pollution  and  set  the  world  on  a  path 
to  a  low-carbon  future.  Under  the  Paris  Agreement,  countries  pledge  to 
limit  global  warming  to  2  degrees  Celsius  at  most,  and  to  pursue  efforts 
to  keep  it  below  1.5  degrees  Celsius.  Science  tells  us  these  levels  will 
help prevent some of the most devastating impacts of climate change, includ-
ing  more  frequent  and  extreme  droughts,  storms,  fires,  and  floods,  as  well 
as catastrophic increases in sea level. 
The  Paris  Agreement  demonstrates  what  is  possible  when  the  world  is 
united  by  a  common  concern  and  a  shared  purpose.  The  Agreement  sets 
ambitious  and  specific  targets  for  each  nation  that  are  necessary  to  solving 
the climate crisis. It applies to all countries, establishes meaningful account-
ability  and  reporting  requirements,  and  brings  countries  back  to  the  table 
every 5 years to grow their commitments as markets change and technologies 
improve.  It  also  provides  financing  mechanisms  so  developing  economies 
can  move  forward  using  clean  energy,  and  it  creates  a  collaborative  process 
through which countries can establish and achieve their targets. 
Key  to  reaching  the  Paris  Agreement  was  principled  American  leadership. 
Over  the  past  decade,  the  United  States  has  cut  our  total  carbon  pollution 
more  than  any  other  nation  on  Earth.  We  are  committed  to  upholding 
our  responsibility  in  the  global  effort  to  combat  climate  change  and  protect 
our  planet,  and  my  Administration  has  taken  action  to  reduce  our  carbon 
pollution  and  lead  the  world  in  transitioning  to  a  clean  energy  future. 
For  example,  we  have  made  significant  investments  in  clean  energy—since 
I  took  Office,  the  amount  of  electricity  generated  from  wind  energy  has

tripled,  and  the  amount  generated  from  solar  energy  has  increased  more 
than  thirtyfold.  Last  year,  I  announced  the  first  set  of  nationwide  standards 
to  end  the  limitless  dumping  of  carbon  pollution  from  our  country’s  power 
plants. To prepare for the impacts of climate change that we cannot prevent, 
we  are  working  with  States  and  cities  to  help  communities  build  climate- 
resilient  infrastructure.  And  I  have  protected  more  public  lands  and  waters 
than any other President in history—more than 265 million acres. 
We  each  have  a  role  to  play  in  ensuring  that  we  do  not  pass  a  world 
beyond  repair  on  to  our  children.  Everyone  must  do  their  part,  and  as 
long  as  we  unite  to  protect  the  one  planet  we  have,  we  can  leave  it  in 
better  shape  for  future  generations.  On  Earth  Day,  let  us  all  accept  our 
individual  responsibilities  to  care  for  the  world  we  live  in,  and  let  us 
marshal  our  best  efforts  toward  building  a  safer,  more  stable,  and  more 
sustainable world. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  22,  2016, 
as  Earth  Day.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  participate  in  programs  and 
activities  that  will  protect  our  environment  and  contribute  to  a  healthy, 
sustainable future. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-first 
day  of  April,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9460  of  June  10,  2016 

Flag  Day  and  National  Flag  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Two hundred and forty years ago, a small band of patriots declared independ-
ence,  proclaiming  in  one  voice  that  we  are  free  to  determine  our  own 
destiny and carry out the work of self-governance. Driven by their unyielding 
spirit  and  drawing  inspiration  from  the  Stars  and  Stripes,  a  string  of  13 
Colonies  later  expanded  to  become  a  united  50  States.  Throughout  our 
history,  the  American  flag  has  steadfastly  served  as  an  emblem  of  this 
great  experiment  in  democracy.  On  Flag  Day  and  during  National  Flag 
Week,  we  pledge  our  allegiance  to  the  banner  that  has  served  as  a  guiding 
symbol  on  our  Nation’s  journey,  and  we  celebrate  the  hope  it  inspires 
in the American people. 
With  hands  over  hearts,  Americans  of  all  backgrounds  and  beliefs  have 
long saluted Old Glory and honored its legacy. Our flag persists as a powerful 
representation of freedom and opportunity. Waving high above capitol build-
ings  and  courthouses,  military  bases  and  embassies  across  the  globe,  and 
on  the  distant  surface  of  the  moon,  it  calls  on  each  of  us  to  remember 
our  obligations  to  the  Republic  for  which  it  stands  and  to  carry  forward 
the  unwavering  optimism  that  defines  us.  America  endures  because  of  the 
courage  of  servicemen  and  women  who  serve  under  this  standard,  and 
our  veterans  are  forever  draped  in  the  red,  white,  and  blue  when  they 
are  laid  to  rest.  Wherever  the  flag  lies  or  flies,  its  message  is  clear:  We 
rise and fall together, as one Nation and one people. 
The  American  flag  invokes  pride  in  our  citizens  and  hope  in  those  who 
come  to  our  shores  in  search  of  a  brighter  tomorrow.  In  recognition  of 
the  ways  it  has  embodied  our  ideals  and  sustained  our  Nation,  let  us 
pay  tribute  to  the  Star  Spangled  Banner  and  continue  striving  to  create 
a more perfect and indivisible Union—with liberty and justice for all. 
To  commemorate  the  adoption  of  our  flag,  the  Congress,  by  joint  resolution 
approved  August  3,  1949,  as  amended  (63  Stat.  492),  designated  June  14 
of each year as ‘‘Flag Day’’ and requested that the President issue an annual 
proclamation  calling  for  its  observance  and  for  the  display  of  the  flag  of 
the  United  States  on  all  Federal  Government  buildings.  The  Congress  also 
requested,  by  joint  resolution  approved  June  9,  1966,  as  amended  (80  Stat. 
194),  that  the  President  annually  issue  a  proclamation  designating  the  week 
in  which  June  14  occurs  as  ‘‘National  Flag  Week’’  and  call  upon  citizens 
of the United States to display the flag during that week. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  14,  2016,  as  Flag  Day  and  the  week 
beginning  June  12,  2016,  as  National  Flag  Week.  I  direct  the  appropriate 
officials  to  display  the  flag  on  all  Federal  Government  buildings  during 
that  week,  and  I  urge  all  Americans  to  observe  Flag  Day  and  National 
Flag  Week  by  displaying  the  flag.  I  also  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  observe  with  pride  and  all  due  ceremony  those  days  from  Flag 
Day  through  Independence  Day,  also  set  aside  by  the  Congress  (89  Stat. 
211), as a time to honor America, to celebrate our heritage in public gatherings 
and  activities,  and  to  publicly  recite  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance  to  the  Flag 
of the United States of America.

Proclamation  9502  of  September  23,  2016 

Gold  Star  Mother’s  and  Family’s  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Since  our  Nation’s  founding,  in  peace  and  in  war,  the  values  that  define 
our  brave  men  and  women  in  uniform  have  remained  constant:  honor, 
courage, and selflessness. From the deafening sounds of combat to the silence 
of  the  sacred  hills  at  Arlington,  we  remember  the  countless  sacrifices  our 
service members make to preserve the freedoms we too often take for granted. 
No  one  understands  the  true  price  of  these  freedoms  like  our  Gold  Star 
families,  whose  humility,  even  in  times  of  grief,  represents  the  best  of 
our country. Today, we recognize their sacrifices by listening to their stories, 
sharing  in  their  pain  and  pride,  and  pledging  to  do  all  we  can  to  honor 
them and the loved ones they hold close in their hearts. 

Through  unspeakable  sorrow,  our  Gold  Star  families  suffer  from  loss  that 
can  never  be  restored—pain  that  can  never  truly  be  healed.  It  is  because 
of  their  selfless  character  and  unfailing  grace  that  Americans  can  come 
home  each  day,  gather  with  family  and  friends,  and  live  in  peace  and 
security.  And  though  the  debt  our  fallen  soldiers  and  their  families  pay 
is  one  we  can  never  fully  pay  back,  we  must  continue  to  support  our 
veterans  when  they  come  home  and  stand  by  our  military  families  who 
endure  unthinkable  loss.  We  must  maintain  the  sacred  covenant  we  share 
with  our  veterans  by  ensuring  they  have  the  care  and  benefits  they  deserve, 
and  as  citizens,  we  must  all  work  to  lift  each  other  up  in  a  manner  that 
is  worthy  of  those  who  laid  down  their  lives  to  protect  the  land  and 
freedoms we cherish. 

Less  than  one  percent  of  our  Nation  wear  the  uniform,  but  all  of  us  have 
an  obligation  to  acknowledge  the  losses  endured  by  Gold  Star  Mothers 
and  Families  and  to  fill  the  painful  absence  of  their  loved  ones  with  our 
profound  gratitude.  We  must  strive  to  support  these  families—not  just  with 
words,  but  with  actions—by  being  there  every  day  for  the  parents,  spouses, 
and children who feel the weight of their loss. On this day of remembrance, 
may  we  carry  forward  the  work  of  those  who  gave  their  last  full  measure 
of  devotion  and  vow  to  keep  their  memories  burning  bright  in  our  hearts. 
And  may  we  lift  up  their  families,  who  have  steadfastly  supported  their 
mission  through  immeasurable  heartbreak,  by  remaining  a  Nation  worthy 
of their sacrifice. 

The  Congress,  by  Senate  Joint  Resolution  115  of  June  23,  1936  (49  Stat. 
1985  as  amended),  has  designated  the  last  Sunday  in  September  as  ‘‘Gold 
Star Mother’s Day.’’ 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  25,  2016, 
as Gold Star Mother’s and Family’s Day. I call upon all Government officials 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  over  Government  buildings  on 
this  special  day.  I  also  encourage  the  American  people  to  display  the  flag 
and  hold  appropriate  ceremonies  as  a  public  expression  of  our  Nation’s 
gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families.

Proclamation  9409  of  March  24,  2016 

Greek  Independence  Day:  A  National  Day  of  Celebration  of 
Greek  and  American  Democracy,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Inspired  by  ancient  Greece’s  example,  America’s  Founding  Fathers  drew 
on  Hellenic  principles  to  guide  our  democracy  in  its  nascence.  Nearly  half 
a  century  after  the  Stars  and  Stripes  first  flew  over  our  country,  a  flag 
was  raised  on  a  mountaintop  in  Greece,  and  a  revolution  spawned  that 
would  bring  democracy  back  to  its  birthplace  and  lay  the  cornerstone  of 
the close relationship enjoyed by our two nations. On the 195th anniversary 
of Greece’s independence, we celebrate the friendship between our countries 
and honor the contributions that Greek Americans have made to our national 
character. 
Our  common  histories  are  reflected  in  our  shared  values.  Throughout  our 
storied  pasts,  our  peoples  have  upheld  the  fundamental  ideals  we  cherish 
by  working  together  to  safeguard  the  foundation  of  democracy  upon  which 
both our nations are built. Greeks and Americans have long stood shoulder- 
to-shoulder in defense of freedom, and today, the Greek American community 
carries  forward  the  legacy  of  past  Greeks  who  enlightened  our  world  by 
continuing  to  enrich  our  society  in  unique  ways.  Driving  generations,  the 
hope  that  incited  both  our  revolutions  still  burns  in  the  hearts  of  Greek 
Americans and in all those across our country who seek even greater oppor-
tunity for our children and grandchildren. 
The  Greek  people  have  faced  extraordinary  challenges  in  recent  years,  yet 
they  remain  steadfast  in  their  resilience  and  perseverance.  In  response  to 
an  ongoing  refugee  and  migration  crisis,  Greece  is  providing  humanitarian 
assistance  to  countless  men,  women,  and  children  seeking  freedom  from 
persecution  and  violence.  As  Americans,  we  stand  with  Greece  as  partners, 
friends,  and  NATO  allies,  and  the  Greek  American  community  serves  as 
an  important  bridge  that  helps  bring  us  together.  At  our  core,  we  share 
deep  ties  of  culture  and  family,  and  respect  for  the  fundamental  rights 
of  democratic  States.  Through  good  times  and  bad,  we  share  a  common 
commitment  to  security  and  liberty  for  people  around  the  world.  On  this 
day,  let  us  reflect  on  nearly  two  centuries  of  strong  bonds  between  our 
nations, and let us recommit to working together to strengthen our respective 
democracies. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  25,  2016, 
as  Greek  Independence  Day:  A  National  Day  of  Celebration  of  Greek  and 
American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9527  of  October  26,  2016 

National  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities  Week, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
America’s  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities  (HBCUs)  are  living 
monuments  to  the  cause  that  has  driven  each  generation  of  our  citizens 
in  the  task  of  perfecting  our  Union—helping  ensure  that  all  people  can 
experience the fullest measure of equality, justice, and possibility. Embodying 
the notion that the ability to pursue a higher education should be an oppor-
tunity  available  to  all,  rather  than  a  privilege  for  a  few,  these  campuses 
were built from a determination to widely and profoundly expand the reach 
of  our  country’s  promise.  During  National  Historically  Black  Colleges  and 
Universities  Week,  we  celebrate  this  aspiration  and  reaffirm  our  support 
for HBCUs. 
Rendered possible by the extraordinary sacrifices and commitment of women 
and  men  who  resolved  to  make  real  and  enduring  the  new  birth  of  freedom 
that  echoed  across  our  country  following  the  end  of  the  Civil  War,  the 
rise  of  these  proud  institutions  marked  the  beginning  of  a  new  chapter 
in our national narrative. With each generation, HBCUs have shaped America 
for  the  better  in  indelible  ways.  From  a  pastor  who  would  give  voice  to 
equality’s cause to the great-grandson of a slave who would reach the bench 
of  our  highest  court;  from  pioneers  of  medical  and  scientific  breakthroughs 
to creators of innovative and prosperous businesses; from artists who expand 
the  boundaries  of  expression  to  historians  who  illuminate  our  past  and 
help  us  write  our  future,  so  much  of  the  progress  that  has  come  to  define 
America  has  been  carried  forward  by  graduates,  academics,  and  leaders 
of these colleges and universities. 
Since I took office, my Administration has focused on expanding opportunity 
and  opening  doors  of  higher  education  for  more  people.  We  have  increased 
Pell  Grants,  expanded  student  loan  assistance  going  directly  to  students, 
cut  taxes  for  those  paying  tuition,  allowed  students  to  cap  their  Federal 
loan payments at 10 percent of their income, and created the College Score-
card to assist prospective students in understanding their options for pursuing 
a  higher  education.  Today,  more  Americans  are  earning  a  degree  in  post- 
secondary  education  than  ever  before,  and  HBCUs  are  playing  an  important 
role.  In  the  6  years  since  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  bolstering  the  White 
House  Initiative  on  HBCUs,  we  have  helped  ensure  that  more  students 
have  greater  opportunities  and  that  these  institutions  can  benefit  from  a 
fuller  range  of  Federal  programs  and  assistance.  HBCUs  and  community 
colleges  help  build  our  Nation’s  economy  and  strengthen  the  middle  class, 
which  is  why  I  am  working  to  make  2  years  of  community  college  free 
for hardworking students across our country through America’s College Prom-
ise—a  proposal  that  also  helps  4-year  HBCUs  provide  more  low-income 
students with up to 2 years of college for free or at reduced tuition. 
This  week,  we  recognize  the  ways  in  which  HBCUs  are  central  to  our 
experience  as  a  Nation  and  recommit  ourselves  to  the  work  that  lies  ahead. 
Let  us  honor  the  spirit  in  which  these  institutions  were  constructed  by 
reaffirming the enduring truths at their core, and let us continue endeavoring

Proclamation  9431  of  April  28,  2016 

Jewish  American  Heritage  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
At  America’s  birth,  our  Founders  fought  off  tyranny  and  declared  a  set 
of  ideals—including  life,  liberty,  and  the  pursuit  of  happiness—that  would 
forever guide our country’s course. For generations since, Jewish Americans, 
having shared in the struggle for freedom, have been instrumental in ensuring 
our Nation stays true to the principles enshrined in our founding documents. 
They  have  helped  bring  about  enduring  progress  in  every  aspect  of  our 
society,  shaping  our  country’s  character  and  embodying  the  values  we  hold 
dear.  This  month,  as  we  pay  tribute  to  their  indelible  contributions,  we 
recommit  to  ridding  our  world  of  bigotry  and  injustice  and  reflect  on  the 
extraordinary  ways  in  which  Jewish  Americans  have  made  our  Union  more 
perfect. 
Many  of  the  Jewish  people  who  reached  our  Nation’s  shores  throughout 
our  history  did  so  fleeing  the  oppression  they  encountered  in  areas  around 
the  world.  Driven  by  the  possibility  of  charting  a  freer  future,  they  endeav-
ored,  on  their  own  and  as  a  community,  to  make  real  the  promise  of 
America—in their individual lives and in the life of our country. Determined 
to  confront  the  racism  that  kept  this  promise  from  being  fully  realized, 
many  Jewish  Americans  found  a  cause  in  the  Civil  Rights  Movement  that— 
in  its  call  for  freedom  and  justice—echoed  the  timeless  message  of  Exodus 
and  the  Jewish  people’s  journey  through  the  ages.  Reflecting  on  the  march 
in  Selma,  Rabbi  Abraham  Joshua  Heschel  once  noted,  ‘‘I  felt  my  legs  were 
praying.’’  From  the  fight  for  women’s  rights  to  LGBT  rights  to  workers’ 
rights,  many  in  the  Jewish  American  community,  drawing  on  lessons  from 
their own past, have trumpeted a clarion call for equality and justice. 
We  cannot  pay  proper  respect  to  the  legacy  of  Jewish  Americans  without 
also  reflecting  on  the  rise  of  anti-Semitism  in  many  parts  of  the  world, 
and in remembering the lessons of the Holocaust, we recognize the imperative 
need to root out prejudice. Subjecting men, women, and children to persecu-
tion  on  the  basis  of  their  ancestry  and  faith,  the  scourge  of  anti-Semitism 
demands  that  we  declare  through  action  and  solidarity  that  an  attack  on 
one  faith  is  an  attack  on  all  faiths.  That  is  why  the  United  States  is  leading 
the  international  effort  to  combat  anti-Semitism—we  helped  organize  the 
first  United  Nations  General  Assembly  meeting  on  anti-Semitism  last  year, 
and  we  are  asking  countries  around  the  world  to  join  us  in  giving  this 
challenge  the  focus  it  demands.  In  celebrating  Jewish  Americans’  contribu-
tions to our country, we also reaffirm our unshakeable commitment to Israel’s 
security  and  the  close  bonds  between  our  two  nations  and  our  peoples. 
Throughout  my  Administration,  the  multifaceted  relationship  between  our 
countries  has  grown  and  strengthened  to  an  unprecedented  degree,  particu-
larly with regard to U.S.-Israeli security assistance and cooperation. 
The  Jewish  American  experience  and  our  Nation  as  a  whole  have  always 
been  held  together  by  the  forces  of  hope  and  resilience.  During  Jewish 
American  Heritage  Month,  as  we  reflect  on  our  past  and  look  toward  the 
future,  let  us  carry  forward  our  mutual  legacy,  grounded  in  our  inter-
connected  roots,  and  affirm  that  it  is  from  the  extraordinary  richness  of 
our  bond  that  we  draw  strength.  And  let  us  renew  our  dedication  to  the

Proclamation  9486  of  September  2,  2016 

Labor  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The strongest middle class the world has ever known was not built overnight. 
It  was  achieved  by  men  and  women  who  believed  that  living  up  to  the 
promise  of  this  Nation  meant  more  than  hoping  for  the  best—it  meant 
toiling  in  the  day,  working  through  the  night,  and  proving  that  theirs  was 
a future worth fighting for. On Labor Day, we celebrate the grit and resilience 
of  America’s  workers  and  their  families,  and  we  recommit  to  reaching  for 
a world in which they are afforded the rights and opportunities they deserve. 
America  celebrated  its  first  Labor  Day  in  the  late  19th  century,  when  a 
group  of  industrial  workers  in  New  York  joined  in  common  purpose  to 
celebrate  their  contributions  to  our  country.  Growing  in  numbers  by  the 
thousands,  they  went  without  their  daily  pay  to  march  for  their  cause— 
setting  in  motion  a  labor  movement  that  has  inspired  generations  of  Ameri-
cans  since.  Clear-eyed  and  persistent,  these  hardworking  union  members, 
and  those  that  followed  in  the  path  they  forged,  helped  secure  privileges 
we  now  take  for  granted—not  only  for  themselves,  but  also  for  their  friends 
and  loved  ones  and  neighbors.  Their  efforts  brought  about  weekends  and 
40-hour  workweeks,  overtime  pay  and  a  minimum  wage,  and  the  collective 
bargaining  rights  that  have  empowered  so  many.  Because  of  the  battles 
they waged, our Nation benefits from health insurance and Medicare, Social 
Security,  and  other  retirement  programs.  Their  legacy  is  one  we  will  never 
stop striving to uphold. 
When  I  took  office,  our  country  faced  the  worst  recession  many  of  us 
had  ever  seen.  But  through  the  determination  of  our  resilient  workforce— 
the best workers on the planet—we have been able to lay a stronger founda-
tion  for  our  economy.  Our  auto  industry  has  emerged  stronger  than  ever, 
and  the  manufacturing  sector,  on  the  decline  during  the  Great  Recession 
and in its aftermath, has added over 800,000 new jobs. American businesses 
have  added  15.1  million  jobs  since  2010.  We  are  now  in  the  middle  of 
the  longest  streak  of  overall  job  growth  on  record,  and  wage  growth  has 
accelerated. 
My  priority  since  taking  office  has  always  been  the  well-being  of  the  Amer-
ican  people,  and  over  the  course  of  my  Administration,  I  have  taken  steps 
to  make  sure  everyone  in  our  workforce  is  treated  and  compensated  in 
ways  that  reflect  the  effort  they  put  in.  Whether  by  pursuing  measures 
that  can  help  ensure  a  fair  day’s  pay  for  a  hard  day’s  work,  updating 
occupational  health  and  safety  rules  so  that  no  one  has  to  risk  their  life 
or  health  for  their  job,  or  working  with  State  leaders  to  increase  access 
to  paid  sick  and  family  leave,  we  have  made  great  strides  on  our  journey 
to  protecting  and  growing  the  middle  class.  We  are  working  to  increase 
and  diversify  apprenticeships  as  part  of  a  job-driven  skills  agenda,  and 
protect middle class savings by expanding retirement security. And by striv-
ing  to  close  the  gender  pay  gap,  include  more  veterans  and  Americans 
with  disabilities  in  our  workforce,  protect  people  who  choose  to  organize 
a union in their workplaces, and prevent people from being denied opportuni-
ties  because  of  who  they  are  or  who  they  love,  we  have  moved  closer 
to  giving  all  our  people  an  equal  shot  at  making  it  in  our  global  economy.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  175 / Friday,  September  9,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

On  Labor  Day,  we  are  reminded  that  jobs  are  about  more  than  a  paycheck. 
They  afford  us  the  ability  to  take  care  of  our  family,  friends,  and  neighbors; 
to  save  for  that  well-deserved  retirement;  to  give  back  to  our  communities 
and  the  country  we  would  do  anything  for.  Jobs  allow  us  to  dream,  to 
look  toward  the  future,  and  to  encourage  our  children  to  do  the  same. 
Though  there  is  much  more  to  do  until  all  our  men  and  women  have 
the  rights  and  respect  they  need  to  thrive  in  their  workplaces,  on  this 
occasion, let us recommit to standing together and resolving to create change. 
If  we  do,  I  am  confident  we  can  reach  new  heights  for  ourselves,  for 
our children, and for generations to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  5,  2016, 
as  Labor  Day.  I  call  upon  all  public  officials  and  people  of  the  United 
States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties that honor the contributions and resilience of working Americans. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  second  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9428  of  April  27,  2016 

Law  Day,  U.S.A.,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

.

A  Proclamation 
Underpinning  American  democracy  and  upholding  the  founding  principles 
of  our  Nation,  the  law  enshrines  our  bedrock  belief  in  equality  and  justice 
for  all.  Central  to  securing  these  ideals  is  ensuring  that  every  American’s 
fundamental, constitutionally-guaranteed individual rights are protected, and 
by respecting these rights, our Nation demonstrates its unwavering dedication 
to  the  law.  Our  fidelity  to  the  rule  of  law  has  guided  our  country  in 
times  of  trial  and  triumph,  and  it  helps  us  keep  faith  with  our  Founders 
and with generations to come. 
On  this  year’s  Law  Day,  we  celebrate  50  years  since  the  Supreme  Court’s 
ruling  in  Miranda  v.  Arizona.  This  landmark  decision  made  clear  that  the 
Fifth  Amendment  ‘‘.
.  serves  to  protect  persons  in  all  settings  in  which 
their  freedom  of  action  is  curtailed  in  any  significant  way  from  being  com-
pelled  to  incriminate  themselves.’’  Miranda  v.  Arizona  institutionalized  the 
important  practice  of  explaining  constitutional  rights  prior  to  interrogation. 
And  it  established  the  important  general  rule  that  individuals  interrogated 
in  police  custody  cannot  have  their  answers  admitted  into  evidence  against 
them  unless  they  had  first  been  informed  of  their  rights—including  the 
right to remain silent and the right to have an attorney present. 
The  Court’s  decision  in  Miranda  v.  Arizona  affirmed  that  ‘‘Equal  Justice 
Under  Law’’  is  more  than  just  words,  but  a  cornerstone  of  our  Nation’s 
legal  system—the  idea  that  no  matter  who  you  are  or  where  you  come 
from,  you  will  be  treated  equally  and  afforded  due  process.  Today,  our 
society  faces  new  challenges  to  this  age-old  tenet.  Our  criminal  justice 
system  is  in  serious  need  of  reform;  disparities  in  stops,  arrests,  and  sen-
tencing  persist;  and  in  too  many  places  distrust  exists  between  community 
members  and  law  enforcement  officers.  I  am  committed  to  ensuring  our 
Nation’s  criminal  justice  system  is  fair,  smart,  and  effective.  By  engaging 
people across America, my Task Force on 21st Century Policing has provided 
a  roadmap  for  strengthening  relationships  between  local  police  and  the 
communities  they  serve,  helping  to  uphold  the  integrity  of  our  criminal 
justice  system.  My  Administration  has  also  taken  action  to  address  unfair 
sentencing  disparities  that  undermine  the  equitable  application  of  the  law, 
and  we  will  continue  working  to  bring  greater  fairness  to  our  criminal 
justice  system  and  to  ensure  that  the  rule  of  law  remains  the  foundation 
of our country. 
Miranda v. Arizona imparts an important lesson: Knowledge of our constitu-
tional rights is an essential component to fully exercising those rights. Safe-
guarding  the  promise  of  equal  justice  requires  the  participation  of  all  our 
citizens,  and  across  America,  community  and  court  programs  that  offer 
civic  education  and  prepare  members  of  the  public  to  fulfill  their  civic 
responsibilities are vital to this task. 
Chief  Justice  Earl  Warren,  the  author  of  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  in 
Miranda  v.  Arizona,  once  observed  that,  ‘‘In  civilized  life,  law  floats  in 
a  sea  of  ethics.’’  The  law  informs  right  from  wrong—it  affects  the  daily 
reality  of  our  lives  and  safeguards  the  birthrights  of  all  Americans.  On 
Law  Day,  let  us  recommit  to  building  a  future  rooted  in  the  rule  of  law,

The  President 

Proclamation  9529  of  October  27,  2016 

Military  Family  Month,  2016 

76267 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  generations,  brave  Americans  have  stepped  forward  and  answered  our 
country’s  call  to  serve  in  our  Armed  Forces.  With  honor  and  distinction, 
our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen fight to defend 
the  principles  upon  which  our  Republic  was  founded  so  that  we  might 
live  in  a  freer  and  more  prosperous  world.  Behind  these  courageous  Ameri-
cans  stand  spouses,  children,  and  parents  who  give  up  precious  time  with 
their  loved  ones,  bearing  the  burden  of  long  deployments  and  difficult 
moves, and oftentimes putting their careers on hold. During Military Family 
Month,  we  salute  the  families  of  those  who  proudly  are  a  part  of  our 
Nation’s  unbroken  chain  of  patriots  for  their  unwavering  devotion,  and 
we renew our sacred vow to uphold our promise to our troops, our veterans, 
and their families. 
Our  military  would  not  be  the  greatest  in  the  world  without  the  strength 
and  support  of  the  loved  ones  who  stand  alongside  our  men  and  women 
in  uniform.  While  our  service  members  are  fighting  to  secure  the  values 
we  cherish  and  defend  our  homeland,  their  spouses  keep  their  households 
running,  sometimes  through  multiple  deployments.  Spouses  of  those  in  the 
military  are  often  forced  to  relocate  across  our  country  or  around  the  globe, 
leaving behind jobs they love and sometimes struggling to find new employ-
ment.  They  are  our  fellow  citizens  and  neighbors;  in  their  service  to  their 
families  and  their  country,  they  represent  the  true  strength  of  America. 
Our  Nation  has  a  solemn  obligation  to  support  and  care  for  the  members 
of  our  military  and  their  families—from  their  first  day  of  training  until 
they  conclude  their  service—and  my  Administration  has  worked  to  ensure 
we  uphold  this  promise.  Through  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  Dr.  Jill 
Biden’s  Joining  Forces  initiative,  we  have  worked  with  both  the  public 
and  private  sectors  to  ensure  service  members,  veterans,  and  their  families 
have  the  tools  they  need  to  succeed  throughout  their  lives.  Over  the  past 
5  years,  we  have  rallied  businesses  to  hire  more  than  1.2  million  veterans 
and military spouses. Today, every single State has taken action to streamline 
professional  licensing  and  credentialing  processes  so  that  military  spouses 
can  continue  their  work  when  they  move  across  State  lines  without  having 
to  re-certify  for  a  job  they  are  already  qualified  for.  We  are  also  working 
to provide the resources military families need to start businesses and pursue 
an  education,  and  we  are  helping  teachers  and  schools  support  military 
children  from  kindergarten  through  college.  By  partnering  with  the  private 
sector,  we  have  also  helped  expand  access  to  essential  science,  technology, 
engineering,  and  math  courses  so  that  60,000  more  military  children  can 
be college-ready and prepared for 21st-century careers. 
We  must  always  be  there  for  our  service  members  and  their  families— 
just  as  they  are  there  for  us.  Through  the  thickest  of  fights  and  the  darkest 
of nights, our extraordinary military families—our heroes on the home front— 
stand  alongside  our  patriots  in  uniform,  and  in  their  example  we  see  the 
very  best  of  our  country’s  spirit.  This  month,  let  us  thank  them  for  their 
tremendous devotion to duty and for their unyielding sacrifice. Let us honor

the  priorities  of  our  Nation  reflect  the  priorities  of  our  military  families. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States

day  of  October,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and 
forty-first.

Proclamation  9442  of  May  5,  2016 

Military  Spouse  Appreciation  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Serving alongside our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guards-
men,  our  Nation’s  military  families  give  of  themselves  and  give  up  their 
time with their loved ones so we may live safely and freely. Few Americans 
fully  understand  the  sacrifices  made  by  those  who  serve  in  uniform,  but 
for  spouses  of  service  members  across  our  country,  the  costs  of  the  freedom 
we  too  often  take  for  granted  are  known  intimately.  On  Military  Spouse 
Appreciation  Day,  we  honor  the  spouses  of  those  who  have  left  behind 
everything  they  know  and  love  to  join  our  Nation’s  unbroken  chain  of 
patriots,  and  we  recommit  to  giving  military  spouses  the  respect,  dignity, 
and support they deserve. 
Enduring  separation  and  relocation,  heartache  and  anticipation,  military 
spouses  demonstrate  a  strength  reflective  of  the  spirit  of  our  Nation.  The 
spouses  of  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  bear  the  burden  of  sustaining 
their  families,  caring  for  children  and  offering  comfort  and  support  while 
their  loved  ones  are  away.  As  a  country,  we  must  keep  faith  with  military 
spouses  and  uphold  our  commitment  to  the  members  of  our  Armed  Forces 
to look after their families. 
Five  years  ago,  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  Dr.  Jill  Biden  launched 
the  Joining  Forces  initiative.  Through  Joining  Forces,  my  Administration 
is  working  to  ensure  the  spouses  of  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  have 
good,  secure  jobs  so  they  can  better  provide  for  their  families.  We  launched 
the  Military  Spouse  Employment  Partnership—uniting  hundreds  of  busi-
nesses  across  America  in  a  collaborative  effort  to  employ  more  military 
spouses.  Additionally,  I  proposed  an  increase  in  funding  to  help  address 
the  barriers  that  too  often  hold  back  transitioning  service  members  and 
their  spouses  from  greater  economic  possibility.  And  I  have  taken  action 
to  improve  access  to  mental  health  care  for  our  veterans  and  their  families, 
and  to  ensure  they  are  able  to  find  adequate  housing—because  anyone 
who  defended  America  should  have  a  home  in  America.  I  encourage  all 
people  to  visit  www.JoiningForces.gov  to  learn  how  to  get  involved  or  for 
more information. 
Military  spouses  exhibit  tremendous  courage  and  unyielding  faith,  and  in 
their  spirit  of  resolve,  we  see  the  best  of  America.  Let  us  celebrate  these 
selfless  individuals  by  supporting  them  and  upholding  our  everlasting  com-
mitment to stand beside them and their families. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  6,  2016,  as 
Military  Spouse  Appreciation  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  honor  military  spouses  with  appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities.

Proclamation  9479  of  August  31,  2016 

National  Alcohol  and  Drug  Addiction  Recovery  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

to  use 

for  assistance 

A  Proclamation 
Every  day,  millions  of  Americans  prove  that  recovery  from  alcohol  and 
substance  use  disorders  is  possible—yet  at  the  same  time,  millions  more 
are struggling with the disease of addiction. These individuals are our family 
members,  friends,  and  neighbors,  and  when  they  are  not  able  to  get  the 
help  they  need,  our  communities  and  our  country  are  not  as  strong  as 
they  can  be.  It  is  up  to  all  of  us  to  help  our  loved  ones  seek  life-saving 
services  when  needed  and  steer  them  toward  recovery.  Throughout  this 
month, we celebrate the successes of all those who know the transformative 
power of recovery, and we renew our commitment to providing the support, 
care, and treatment that people need to forge a healthier life. 
Substance  use  disorder,  commonly  known  as  addiction,  is  a  disease  of 
the  brain,  and  many  misconceptions  surrounding  it  have  contributed  to 
harmful  stigmas  that  can  prevent  individuals  from  seeking  the  treatment 
they need. By treating substance use disorders as seriously as other medical 
conditions,  with  an  emphasis  on  prevention  and  treatment,  people  can  re-
cover.  This  month’s  theme  is,  ‘‘Join  the  Voices  for  Recovery:  Our  Families, 
Our  Stories,  Our  Recovery!’’.  Focusing  on  the  importance  of  family  support 
throughout  recovery,  it  invites  families,  loved  ones,  and  other  individuals 
to  share  their  stories  and  triumphs  in  fighting  substance  use  disorders  to 
inspire  others  that  may  follow  in  their  footsteps.  I  encourage  all  Americans 
looking 
tool  at 
www.SAMHSA.gov or call 1–800–662–HELP. 
This disease can touch any American in any community, and my Administra-
tion  has  made  combatting  substance  use  disorders  a  priority.  Under  the 
Affordable  Care  Act,  insurance  companies  must  now  cover  substance  use 
disorder  services  as  essential  health  benefits.  The  Mental  Health  Parity  and 
Addiction  Equity  Act  requires  health  plans  that  cover  mental  health  and 
substance  use  disorder  treatment  to  provide  coverage  that  is  comparable 
to  that  of  medical  and  surgical  care.  Through  our  National  Drug  Control 
Strategy—a  21st  century  approach  to  reducing  drug  use  and  its  con-
sequences—we  have  promoted  evidence-based  health  and  safety  initiatives 
that  aim  to  prevent  drug  use,  increase  opportunities  for  early  intervention 
and  integrated  treatment  in  health  care,  and  support  recovery.  In  response 
to  our  Nation’s  opioid  overdose  epidemic,  we  are  highlighting  tools  that 
can  help  reduce  drug  use  and  overdose,  such  as  evidence-based  prevention 
programs,  prescription  drug  take-back  events,  medication-assisted  treatment 
for  people  with  opioid  use  disorders,  and  the  overdose  reversal  drug 
naloxone.  That  is  why,  in  my  most  recent  budget  proposal,  I  proposed 
investing  $1  billion  to  expand  access  to  treatment  for  prescription  opioid 
misuse and heroin use. I will continue urging the Congress to fund treatment 
like  I  have  proposed—because  if  they  fund  these  efforts,  we  can  help  more 
individuals  across  our  country  seek  help,  complete  treatment,  and  sustain 
recovery. 
During  National  Alcohol  and  Drug  Addiction  Recovery  Month,  let  us  thank 
health care professionals, support groups, and all those dedicated to helping 
individuals  in  need  find  assistance  and  reclaim  their  lives.  Let  us  continue

Proclamation  9507  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  year,  too  many  Americans  are  touched  by  the  pain  and  hardship 
caused  by  breast  cancer—a  disease  that,  among  women,  is  not  only  one 
of  the  most  common  cancers,  but  also  one  of  the  leading  causes  of  cancer- 
related  death.  During  National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  we  honor 
all  those  who  lost  their  lives  to  breast  cancer,  and  we  recognize  the  coura-
geous  survivors  who  are  still  fighting  it.  For  these  individuals,  and  for 
their  loved  ones  who  give  their  unwavering  support  during  the  most  trying 
times, we recommit ourselves to the essential and necessary work of forging 
a future free from cancer in all its forms. 
Hundreds  of  thousands  of  Americans  will  be  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer 
this  year,  and  tens  of  thousands  will  lose  their  battle  with  this  disease. 
Although  both  women  and  men  can  have  breast  cancer,  women  are  at 
higher  risk.  Women  with  a  family  history  of  breast  cancer,  or  those  who 
are  older  or  obese,  are  also  more  likely  to  be  diagnosed  with  breast  cancer. 
I  encourage  all  women  to  find  out  if  they  are  at  increased  risk  and  to 
learn  more  about  recommended  screenings  by  speaking  with  their  health 
care providers and by visiting www.Cancer.gov/Breast. 
Early  detection  and  treatment  can  save  lives.  Since  I  took  office,  I  have 
worked to make quality, affordable health care a reality for more Americans. 
The  Affordable  Care  Act  has  given  millions  of  women  expanded  access 
to preventive services, including screening tests such as mammograms, with 
no  out-of-pocket  costs.  Women  can  no  longer  be  denied  coverage  because 
of  a  pre-existing  condition,  including  a  family  history  of  breast  cancer, 
and  lifetime  and  annual  limits  on  essential  health  benefits  have  been  elimi-
nated. 
Critical  research  efforts  over  time  have  yielded  great  progress  in  how  we 
diagnose  and  treat  breast  cancer,  which  has  produced  a  steady  increase 
in  survival  rates  for  those  suffering  from  this  disease—and  it  is  crucial 
that  we  keep  building  on  these  successes.  This  year,  the  National  Cancer 
Institute  launched  the  largest  study  of  its  kind  to  investigate  the  role  of 
genetic  and  biological  factors  in  breast  cancer  risk  among  African  American 
women,  who  have  a  higher  risk  of  dying  from  breast  cancer.  The  White 
House  Cancer  Moonshot  Task  Force,  also  launched  this  year,  is  a  new 
national  effort  striving  to  make  a  decade’s  worth  of  progress  in  preventing, 
diagnosing,  and  treating  cancer  in  just  5  years.  And  through  the  Precision 
Medicine Initiative—a bold research effort aimed at delivering disease preven-
tion and treatment based on an individual’s unique traits and genetic informa-
tion—we are pursuing new oncology-focused efforts to advance personalized 
care through targeted cancer therapies. 
This  month,  with  bold  pink  ribbons  displayed  proudly  across  America, 
we stand in solidarity with breast cancer survivors and reaffirm our commit-
ment  to  raising  awareness  of  this  disease  and  to  advancing  research  efforts. 
Let  us  thank  the  countless  advocates,  medical  professionals,  researchers, 
and  caregivers  who  dedicate  their  lives  to  fighting  for  a  world  without 
breast  cancer,  and  together,  let  us  carry  out  our  mission  to  cure  cancer 
once and for all.

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9411  of  March  31,  2016 

The  President 

National  Cancer  Control  Month,  2016 

19849 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Undaunted  by  challenge  and  unceasing  in  pursuit  of  progress,  our  Nation 
has  pushed  the  boundaries  of  possibility  throughout  our  history.  Today, 
while  cancer  remains  among  the  leading  causes  of  death  around  the  world 
and  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  here  at  home,  cancer  research  is 
on  the  cusp  of  major  breakthroughs,  offering  incredible  promise  to  those 
suffering  from  this  disease.  This  month,  we  remember  the  loved  ones  we 
have  lost,  pledge  support  for  the  families  we  can  still  save,  and  reaffirm 
our commitment to curing cancer once and for all. 
Cancer  can  affect  people  of  all  ages,  races,  and  backgrounds,  but  certain 
risk  factors  exist  that  can  often  be  mitigated.  Limiting  alcohol  consumption, 
controlling sun exposure, exercising, getting recommended cancer screenings, 
and  maintaining  a  healthy  diet  are  all  ways  to  reduce  your  risk  of  getting 
cancer.  Additionally,  smoking  remains  one  of  the  top  causes  of  cancer, 
responsible  for  1  in  3  cancer  deaths  in  the  United  States.  By  promoting 
resources to help people quit smoking and limiting exposure to secondhand 
smoke,  we  can  reduce  individuals’  cancer  risks.  Help  for  quitting  smoking 
can  be  found  at  www.SmokeFree.gov  or  by  calling  1–800–QUIT–NOW.  I 
urge  all  Americans  to  visit  www.Cancer.gov  or  www.CDC.gov/Cancer  to 
learn more. 
My  Administration  is  committed  to  reaching  a  future  free  from  cancer  in 
all  its  forms.  Earlier  this  year,  I  created  the  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot 
Task Force. Chaired by Vice President Joe Biden, this effort aims to accelerate 
our  progress  toward  prevention,  treatment,  and  cures  by  putting  ourselves 
on  a  path  to  achieving  at  least  a  decade’s  worth  of  advances  in  5  years. 
Together  with  patients,  philanthropies,  private  industry,  and  the  medical 
and scientific communities, the United States can be the country that finally 
finds  a  cure  for  this  disease,  and  we  have  already  proposed  a  $1  billion 
initiative  to  jumpstart  this  critical  work.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  continues 
to  help  people  with  cancer  and  at  risk  for  cancer  by  prohibiting  insurers 
from  denying  coverage  to  anyone  based  on  a  preexisting  condition  and 
requiring  insurers  to  cover  recommended  preventive  benefits  without  cost- 
sharing.  And  the  Precision  Medicine  Initiative  that  I  launched  last  year 
continues to work toward a new era of medicine that offers targeted treatment 
at the right time to individual patients by accounting for their unique genes, 
health histories, and other personal factors. 
Our  Nation  has  made  extraordinary  strides  in  the  fight  against  cancer,  but 
much  work  remains  to  be  done.  With  more  than  one  and  a  half  million 
new  cases  of  cancer  expected  in  the  United  States  this  year,  we  owe  it 
to  everyone  currently  living  with  it  and  to  anyone  at  risk  to  support  all 
those  working  to  defeat  it.  During  National  Cancer  Control  Month,  let  us 
remember  those  who  lost  their  battle  with  cancer,  and  let  us  renew  our 
efforts  to  save  lives  and  spare  heartbreak  by  reaching  a  future  without 
this devastating disease. 
The  Congress  of  the  United  States,  by  joint  resolution  approved  March 
28,  1938  (52  Stat.  148;  36  U.S.C.  103),  as  amended,  has  requested  the

Proclamation  9545  of  November  18,  2016 

National  Child’s  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
No  matter  what  zip  code  they  are  born  into,  every  young  child  in  America 
deserves  the  opportunity  to  learn,  grow,  and  realize  their  dreams  in  a  safe 
and  healthy  environment.  From  ensuring  they  are  cared  for  and  nourished 
to  helping  them  become  educated  participants  in  our  democracy,  we  must 
all  do  our  part  to  support  the  next  generation  of  leaders.  Today,  let  us 
lift  up  every  child  in  need  and  strive  to  leave  behind  a  world  that  we 
are proud of for children across our country. 
My  Administration  has  worked  to  put  children  in  every  community  on 
a  path  to  a  healthier  future.  Through  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama’s  Let’s 
Move! initiative, we have fostered environments that support healthy choices, 
promote physical activity, and reduce childhood obesity. We have also fought 
to  improve  Head  Start  and  expand  quality,  affordable  child  care,  which 
promotes  healthy  development  and  school  readiness  in  young  children  and 
helps  families  be  more  financially  secure  at  home.  Because  of  the  broader 
coverage  expansions  made  possible  by  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA),  and 
improvements made to the Children’s Health Insurance Plan through legisla-
tion  I  signed  during  my  first  month  in  office,  more  than  3  million  children 
have  gotten  health  insurance  and  the  uninsured  rate  among  children  has 
fallen  by  almost  half  since  2008.  And  because  of  the  ACA,  children  can 
no  longer  be  denied  coverage  because  of  a  pre-existing  condition.  They 
can  also  remain  on  a  parent’s  health  insurance  plan  until  age  26,  and 
all  plans  on  the  Health  Insurance  Marketplace  are  now  required  to  cover 
basic  pediatric  services.  Anyone  who  is  in  need  of  health  insurance  can 
visit www.HealthCare.gov to find coverage for themselves and their children. 
You can also visit www.Medicaid.gov to find out if you qualify for coverage 
through Medicaid. 
It is one of our greatest obligations to create cleaner and safer environments 
for  our  children  to  live  in.  Not  only  must  we  protect  our  planet  against 
climate  change  and  secure  it  for  future  generations,  but  we  must  continue 
taking  concrete  action  to  reduce  the  effects  that  dirty  air  and  water  can 
impose on our children—such as the potential for higher incidence of asthma 
attacks.  We  must  also  work  to  keep  our  children  safe  from  violence  and 
abuse,  prevent  youth  substance  use  and  its  consequences,  and  modernize 
our juvenile justice system to hold youth accountable for their actions without 
consigning them to a never-ending cycle of incarceration. 
We  know  that  when  we  invest  in  young  children,  the  outcomes  are  signifi-
cant—and  by  investing  in  early  education  and  preschool  for  all,  we  can 
set  children  up  for  success  later  in  life.  Education  has  the  potential  to 
unlock  ladders  of  opportunity  and  empower  children  to  pursue  their  pas-
sions,  and  we  must  continue  working  to  strengthen  our  Nation’s  education 
system  for  children  at  every  grade  level.  That  is  why  my  Administration 
has pursued efforts to bring higher education within reach for more students 
and make college more affordable. 
Our  journey  is  not  complete  until  all  our  children  are  cared  for,  cherished, 
and  safe  from  harm.  On  National  Child’s  Day,  let  us  forge  a  future  of 
greater  opportunity  and  prosperity  for  every  young  person,  and  let  us  seek

Proclamation  9404  of  March  4,  2016 

National  Consumer  Protection  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
After  a  long  road  to  recovery,  our  Nation  has  risen  from  the  depths  of 
recession  thanks  to  the  grit  and  determination  of  the  American  people. 
Ensuring  hardworking  families  feel  secure  and  confident  that  they  can  get 
ahead  without  being  ripped  off  or  getting  sucked  into  vicious  cycles  of 
debt  was  essential  to  our  rebound  and  is  critical  to  our  continuing  efforts 
to  build  an  economy  that  works  better  for  everyone.  When  we  uphold 
our  country’s  promise  of  fairness  and  opportunity,  we  all  do  better,  and 
during  National  Consumer  Protection  Week,  we  reaffirm  our  fidelity  to  this 
ideal  by  striving  to  build  an  economy  based  on  the  principles  of  fair  play, 
equal access, and shared responsibility. 
When  I  took  office,  big  banks  that  made  reckless  bets  were  relying  on 
the American people to clean up after them. That is why my Administration 
pursued  historic  Wall  Street  reform,  enacting  strong  consumer  protections 
and  stabilizing  the  foundation  of  our  country’s  economic  prosperity.  We 
proposed  new  rules  that  protect  people  from  unscrupulous  lenders—includ-
ing  those  engaged  in  abusive  practices  involving  payday  loans  and  title 
loans,  which  too  often  trap  families  in  unfair  and  expensive  cycles  of  fees. 
Additionally,  because  no  one  should  be  saddled  with  debt  before  they  get 
started in life, we capped student loan payments at 10 percent of a borrower’s 
monthly  income  through  the  Pay  As  You  Earn  plan.  We  also  established 
a  Student  Aid  Bill  of  Rights  that  calls  for  all  students  to  have  access 
to  a  quality,  affordable  education  and  the  resources  to  pay  for  it,  as  well 
as  the  right  to  affordable  loan  payments,  quality  customer  service,  reliable 
information,  and  equal  treatment.  And  to  ensure  the  American  dream  can 
be  enjoyed  by  those  who  selflessly  defend  it,  we  announced  updated  rules 
to close loopholes that allowed predatory lenders to demand unfair payments 
and exorbitant fees from our men and women in uniform and their families. 
While  Government  plays  an  important  role  in  protecting  our  people  and 
our  financial  system,  individuals  can  take  steps  on  their  own  to  detect 
abuse  and  safeguard  their  assets  and  personal  data.  As  we  continue  to 
educate  the  public  on  matters  of  personal  finance  and  inform  young  people 
of  the  dangers  of  too  much  debt,  consumers  should  thoroughly  read  and 
understand  their  loan  agreements,  assess  their  own  financial  capacity,  and 
take care to guard against identity theft. To assist in this effort, my Adminis-
tration  will  keep  working  to  make  online  transactions  more  secure,  conven-
ient,  and  private.  For  additional  information  on  your  rights  as  a  consumer, 
visit  www.NCPW.gov,  and  to  report  and  recover  from  identity  theft,  visit 
www.IdentityTheft.gov. 
Throughout  this  week,  let  us  celebrate  the  core  values  of  honesty  and  fair 
play  by  upholding  the  basic  American  bargain—that  hard  work  should  pay 
off  and  responsibility  should  be  rewarded.  Together,  we  can  ensure  nobody 
is  financially  taken  advantage  of  and  everybody  has  an  equal  opportunity 
to go as far as their dreams and talents will take them. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  6  through

27983 

Proclamation  9441  of  May  4,  2016 

National  Day  of  Prayer,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  times  of  steady  calm  and  extraordinary  change  alike,  Americans  of  all 
walks of life have long turned to prayer to seek refuge, demonstrate gratitude, 
and  discover  peace.  Sustaining  us  through  great  uncertainty  and  moments 
of  sorrow,  prayer  allows  us  an  outlet  for  introspection,  and  for  expressing 
our  hopes,  desires,  and  fears.  It  offers  strength  in  the  face  of  hardship, 
and  redemption  when  we  falter.  Our  country  was  founded  on  the  idea 
of  religious  freedom,  and  we  have  long  upheld  the  belief  that  how  we 
pray  and  whether  we  pray  are  matters  reserved  for  an  individual’s  own 
conscience. On National Day of Prayer, we rededicate ourselves to extending 
this freedom to all people. 
Every  day,  women  and  men  use  the  wisdom  gained  from  humble  prayer 
to spread kindness and to make our world a better place. Faith communities 
at home and abroad have helped feed the hungry, heal the sick, and protect 
innocents  from  violence.  Nurturing  communities  with  love  and  under-
standing, their prayer inspires their work, which embodies a timeless notion 
that has kept humanity going through the ages—that one of our most sacred 
responsibilities is to give of ourselves in service to others. 
The  threats  of  poverty,  violence,  and  war  around  the  world  are  all  too 
real.  Our  faith  and  our  earnest  prayers  can  be  cures  for  the  fear  we  feel 
as  we  confront  these  realities.  Helping  us  resist  despair,  paralysis,  or  cyni-
cism,  prayer  offers  a  powerful  alternative  to  pessimism.  Through  prayer, 
we  often  gain  the  insight  to  learn  from  our  mistakes,  the  motivation  to 
always  be  better,  and  the  courage  to  stand  up  for  what  is  right,  even  when 
it is not popular. 
Each of us is an author in our collective American story, and in participating 
in our national discourse to address some of our Nation’s greatest challenges, 
we  are  reminded  of  the  blessing  we  have  to  live  in  a  land  where  we 
are  able  to  freely  express  the  beliefs  we  hold  in  our  hearts.  The  United 
States will continue to stand up for those around the world who are subject 
to  fear  or  violence  because  of  their  religion  or  beliefs.  As  a  Nation  free 
to  practice  our  faith  as  we  choose,  we  must  remember  those  around  the 
world who are not afforded this freedom, and we must recommit to building 
a  society  where  all  can  enjoy  this  liberty  and  live  their  lives  in  peace 
and dignity. 
On  this  day,  may  our  faiths  enable  us  to  sow  the  seeds  of  progress  in 
our  ever-changing  world.  Let  us  resolve  to  guide  our  children  and  grand-
children to embrace freedom for all, to see God in everyone, and to remember 
that  no  matter  what  differences  they  may  have,  they,  just  like  we,  will 
always be united by their common humanity. 
The Congress, by Public Law 100–307, as amended, has called on the Presi-
dent  to  issue  each  year  a  proclamation  designating  the  first  Thursday  in 
May as a ‘‘National Day of Prayer.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  5,  2016,  as

Proclamation  9488  of  September  9,  2016 

National  Days  of  Prayer  and  Remembrance,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

On  September  11,  2001,  a  group  of  small  and  hateful  minds  conspired 
to  threaten  the  very  fiber  of  our  country,  seeking  to  break  the  American 
spirit and destroy our way of life. From the Atlantic to the Pacific, Americans 
were  struck  with  grief  as  devastation  and  senseless  loss  of  innocent  human 
life  unfolded.  In  the  empty  shadow  of  the  World  Trade  Center,  the  remains 
of  the  Pentagon,  and  a  charred  Pennsylvania  field  where  courageous  pas-
sengers  saved  countless  lives,  what  emerged  from  the  ashes  of  that  day 
was not defeat—it was the heroism, compassion, and unity of the American 
people,  which  no  act  of  terror  or  hate  could  ever  take  away.  On  September 
11,  we  recall  the  true  spirit  of  our  Nation  following  these  heinous  attacks, 
and we resolve to enshrine the enduring compassion and love of our people 
forever in the heart of America. 

Fifteen  years  later,  we  pay  tribute  to  the  loss  of  nearly  3,000  lives,  reflect 
on  treasured  memories  of  those  we  lost,  and  resolve  to  never  forget  that 
day,  even  as  we  look  toward  a  brighter  and  more  hopeful  future.  We  draw 
inspiration  from  the  survivors  who  still  bear  the  scars—both  seen  and  un-
seen—of that tragic day. We honor the valiance of our Nation’s first respond-
ers,  whose  instinct  was  not  to  turn  back  to  find  safety  for  themselves, 
but  to  run  toward  untold  danger.  We  show  our  gratitude  to  those  young 
Americans  of  the  9/11  Generation,  who  until  that  day  lived  knowing  only 
peace,  but  who  have  answered  our  country’s  call  to  serve  under  our  flag 
to meet the threats of our time with bravery and distinction. 

In  the  years  that  have  followed,  with  prayer  and  reflection,  grace  and  faith, 
Americans  have  grieved  together,  held  each  other  close,  and  looked  out 
for  one  another.  Though  the  void  felt  by  those  who  lost  a  loved  one  on 
that  day  can  never  be  filled,  we  can  continue  to  heal  the  wounds  inflicted 
by  hatred  by  honoring  the  notion  that,  no  matter  our  differences,  we  are 
forever united as one American family. 

As  we  mourn  on  this  most  solemn  anniversary,  let  us  also  reflect  on  the 
freedom  and  tolerance  that  define  this  great  Nation,  and  let  us  reaffirm 
our commitment to preserving those fundamental values for each generation 
of Americans to come. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  Friday,  September 
9  through  Sunday,  September  11,  2016,  as  National  Days  of  Prayer  and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States honor and remember 
the  victims  of  September  11,  2001,  and  their  loved  ones  through  prayer, 
contemplation,  memorial  services,  the  visiting  of  memorials,  the  ringing 
of bells, evening candlelight remembrance vigils, and other appropriate cere-
monies  and  activities.  I  invite  people  around  the  world  to  participate  in 
this commemoration.

57743 

Proclamation  9474  of  August  19,  2016 

National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve  Week, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  more  than  two  centuries,  brave  patriots  have  given  of  themselves  to 
secure our fundamental rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness— 
and  in  times  of  both  war  and  peace,  members  of  the  National  Guard  and 
Reserve  have  stood  ready  to  don  our  uniform,  answer  our  Nation’s  call, 
and  protect  our  way  of  life.  This  week,  we  recognize  the  important  role 
played by the families, employers, and communities of these men and women 
in  ensuring  they  can  step  forward  and  serve  our  country  when  they  are 
needed most. 
There are more than one million members of our National Guard and Reserve. 
Throughout  the  year,  they  dutifully  train  and  prepare  so  that  when  they 
are  called  at  a  moment’s  notice  to  serve  their  Nation,  they  are  able  to 
serve  with  the  honor  and  dedication  that  have  long  been  hallmarks  of 
our Armed Forces. Balancing their lives as civilians with their responsibilities 
in  uniform,  they  defend  and  protect  our  people  at  home  and  abroad.  In 
the  face  of  natural  disasters  and  humanitarian  crises,  they  are  quick  to 
respond  and  offer  assistance;  during  periods  of  conflict  and  strife,  they 
help keep us safe and protect our national interests. 
These  citizen-Soldiers,  Sailors,  Airmen,  Marines,  and  Coast  Guardsmen  de-
serve  the  full  backing  of  their  civilian  employers  and  the  promise  of  a 
secure and stable life here at home. From the businesses that seek to recruit 
and  retain  these  patriots  in  the  workplace  to  the  supporters  who  provide 
leadership  and  resources,  this  unconditional  care  for  our  Guardsmen  and 
Reservists  and  their  families  is  part  of  what  makes  our  military  the  greatest 
fighting force the world has ever known. 
Americans  who  volunteer  to  serve  their  country  should  always  be  able 
to  partake  in  its  opportunities.  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  Dr.  Jill 
Biden’s  Joining  Forces  initiative  has  worked  to  make  it  easier  for  military 
spouses  and  veterans  to  find  employment  and  ensure  they  are  supported 
in  the  workforce.  And  my  Administration  has  worked  across  all  sectors 
to encourage communities to hire veterans and match members of the Guard 
and  Reserve  to  the  jobs  they  deserve.  We  must  never  waver  in  our  commit-
ment  to  fight  for  those  who  have  fought  for  us,  and  we  must  continue 
striving  to  connect  each  of  them  with  opportunities  to  keep  their  families 
strong and our country competitive. 
During  National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve  Week,  let 
us honor the members of our Guard and Reserve for their steadfast dedication 
to  us  all—both  in  and  out  of  uniform.  And  let  us  acknowledge  the  families, 
employers, and businesses whose encouragement and flexibility have enabled 
our  military  to  thrive,  and  whose  support  has  been  vital  to  the  success, 
stability, and security of our Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  August  21  through 
August  27,  2016,  as  National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve

Proclamation  9422  of  April  11,  2016 

National  Equal  Pay  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our  Nation  is  built  on  the  basic  promise  of  a  fair  shot  for  all  our  people. 
Women  in  the  United  States  still  do  not  always  receive  equal  pay  for 
equal  work.  When  women  are  paid  less  for  doing  the  same  jobs  as  men, 
it  undermines  our  most  fundamental  beliefs  as  Americans.  Every  year,  we 
mark  how  far  into  the  new  year  women  would  have  to  work  in  order 
to  earn  the  same  as  men  did  in  the  previous  year,  and  on  this  day,  we 
reaffirm our commitment to ensuring equal pay for all. 
Although  small  gains  have  been  made  in  recent  years,  the  typical  woman 
working  full-time,  year-round  earns  only  79  cents  for  every  dollar  earned 
by  the  typical  man,  and  women  of  color  earn  even  less  relative  to  the 
typical  white,  non-Hispanic  man—60  cents  on  the  dollar  for  the  typical 
black  woman  and  55  cents  on  the  dollar  for  the  typical  Hispanic  woman. 
Women  are  increasingly  the  breadwinners  of  American  households,  and 
when  they  are  not  paid  equally,  or  are  underrepresented  in  certain  higher- 
paying  occupations,  their  ability  to  save  for  retirement  is  hindered  and 
hardworking  families  face  greater  difficulty  meeting  their  basic  financial 
needs.  Pay  discrimination  puts  greater  strain  on  families  to  cover  costs 
like child care or health care, and it holds our economy back from achieving 
its  full  potential.  We  must  continue  taking  action  to  address  issues  of  equal 
pay,  pay  secrecy,  pregnancy  discrimination,  and  unconscious  bias.  The  gen-
der pay gap in the United States is among the largest of many industrialized 
nations,  and  because  women  make  up  nearly  half  our  workforce,  this  dis-
parity  impacts  us  all.  The  pay  gap  between  men  and  women  offends  our 
values  as  Americans,  and  as  long  as  it  exists,  our  businesses,  our  commu-
nities, and our Nation will suffer the consequences. 
My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  reaching  a  day  in  which  all  women 
are  paid  equally  for  their  work.  Earlier  this  year,  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity  Commission,  in  partnership  with  the  Department  of  Labor,  an-
nounced  a  new  proposal  to  gather  pay  data  by  race,  ethnicity,  and  gender 
from  businesses  with  at  least  100  employees.  This  will  help  businesses 
make  sure  their  employees  are  being  treated  equally,  and  it  will  help  us 
enforce  existing  equal  pay  laws.  This  proposal  originated  in  part  with  my 
National  Equal  Pay  Task  Force,  which  has  helped  coordinate  a  Federal 
effort  to  crack  down  on  violations  of  equal  pay  laws.  Our  Nation  has  taken 
significant  steps  toward  achieving  pay  equity  over  the  last  7  years—from 
the  first  piece  of  legislation  I  signed  as  President,  the  Lilly  Ledbetter  Fair 
Pay  Act,  which  makes  it  easier  for  women  to  challenge  unequal  pay,  to 
my  Executive  Order  prohibiting  Federal  contractors  from  discriminating 
against employees who discuss their compensation. But much work remains 
to  be  done,  which  is  why  I  continue  to  call  on  the  Congress  to  pass  the 
Paycheck  Fairness  Act—a  commonsense  measure  that  would  bolster  the 
ability of women to fight pay discrimination. 
When  all  people  know  their  country  is  invested  in  their  success,  we  are 
all  better  off.  Together,  we  must  rid  our  society  of  the  injustice  that  is 
pay  discrimination  and  restore  the  promise  that  is  the  right  of  every  Amer-
ican:  the  idea  that  with  hard  work,  anyone  can  reach  for  their  dreams

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9493  of  September  14,  2016 

National  Hispanic  Heritage  Month,  2016 

64049 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  our  founding,  our  Nation  has  drawn  strength  from  the  diversity  of 
our  people.  With  faith  and  passion,  a  sturdy  work  ethic  and  profound 
devotion  to  family,  Hispanics  have  helped  carry  forward  our  legacy  as  a 
vibrant  beacon  of  opportunity  for  all.  Whether  their  ancestors  have  been 
here for generations or they are among the newest members of our American 
family,  they  represent  many  countries  and  cultures,  each  adding  their  own 
distinct  and  dynamic  perspective  to  our  country’s  story.  In  celebration  of 
National  Hispanic  Heritage  Month,  we  honor  the  contributions  Hispanics 
have  made  throughout  our  history,  and  we  highlight  an  important  part 
of the rich diversity that keeps our communities strong. 
Hispanic  Americans  have  had  a  lasting  impact  on  our  history  and  have 
helped  drive  hard-won  progress  for  all  our  people.  They  are  the  writers, 
singers,  and  musicians  that  enrich  our  arts  and  humanities;  the  innovative 
entrepreneurs  steering  our  economy.  They  are  the  scientists  and  engineers 
revolutionizing  our  ways  of  life  and  making  sweeping  new  discoveries; 
the  advocates  leading  the  way  for  social  and  political  change.  They  are 
the brave men and women in uniform who commit themselves to defending 
our  most  cherished  ideals  at  home  and  abroad.  And  their  lasting  achieve-
ments  and  devotion  to  our  Nation  exemplify  the  tenacity  and  perseverance 
embedded in our national character. 
My Administration stands firmly committed to opening doors of opportunity 
for  all  Americans  and  addressing  issues  of  vital  importance  to  the  Hispanic 
community.  The  unemployment  rate  for  the  Hispanic  community  has 
dropped  steadily  since  I  took  office,  and  we  have  worked  to  support  the 
growth  and  development  of  Hispanic-owned  businesses.  Last  year,  Hispanic 
Americans  saw  the  largest  gains  of  any  racial  or  ethnic  group  in  median 
income  and  experienced  among  the  greatest  reductions  in  poverty.  We  have 
fought  to  make  home  ownership  more  affordable  and  to  raise  the  Federal 
minimum wage—which would benefit more than 8 million Hispanic workers. 
Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  4  million  Hispanic  non-elderly  adults 
have gained access to quality, affordable health care, reducing the uninsured 
rate  among  Hispanics  by  more  than  a  quarter.  The  high  school  graduation 
rate  among  Hispanic  students  is  rising,  and  we  have  taken  action  to  help 
more  Hispanic  students  enroll  in  college.  And  by  charting  a  new  course 
in  our  relationship  with  Cuba,  we  are  strengthening  communication  and 
bolstering relations between friends and family in both countries—reinforcing 
many ties to Latin America. 
Our  Nation’s  remarkable  story  began  with  immigration.  Today,  we  must 
continue  seeking  to  make  the  promise  of  our  Nation  real  in  the  lives  of 
all  people,  including  for  those  who  are  Americans  by  every  measure  except 
for  a  piece  of  paper.  Through  the  Deferred  Action  for  Childhood  Arrivals 
policy, hardworking young Dreamers—including many Hispanics—have been 
given  more  opportunities  to  reach  for  their  highest  aspirations.  I  remain 
deeply  committed  to  passing  comprehensive  immigration  reform,  and  my 
Administration  will  continue  doing  all  that  we  can  to  carry  forward  our 
Nation’s  legacy  as  a  melting  pot  of  the  world.  Through  the  work  of  the

White  House  Task  Force  on  New  Americans,  we  are  striving  to  support 
the  integration  of  immigrants  and  refugees  into  our  communities.  We  will 
continue  to  welcome  those  fleeing  persecution,  including  those  from  the 
Western  Hemisphere,  and  we  will  keep  working  to  make  our  immigration 
system fairer and smarter. 
This  month,  let  us  reflect  on  the  countless  ways  in  which  Hispanics  have 
contributed  to  our  Nation’s  success,  and  let  us  reaffirm  our  commitment 
to  expanding  opportunity  and  building  an  ever  brighter  future  for  all.  Let 
us embrace the diversity that strengthens us and continue striving to ensure 
the  American  dream  is  within  reach  for  generations  of  Hispanics  to  come. 
To honor the achievements of Hispanics in America, the Congress by Public 
Law  100–402,  as  amended,  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to 
issue  annually  a  proclamation  designating  September  15  through  October 
15 as ‘‘National Hispanic Heritage Month.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  15  through  October  15,  2016, 
as National Hispanic Heritage Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
librarians,  and  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month  with  appropriate  cere-
monies, activities, and programs. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  fourteenth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9385  of  December  31,  2015 

National  Mentoring  Month,  2016 

713 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
At  the  heart  of  America’s  promise  is  the  belief  that  we  all  do  better  when 
everyone has a fair shot at reaching for their dreams. Throughout our Nation’s 
history,  Americans  of  every  background  have  worked  to  uphold  this  ideal, 
joining  together  in  common  purpose  to  serve  as  mentors  and  lift  up  our 
country’s  youth.  During  National  Mentoring  Month,  we  honor  all  those 
who  continuously  strive  to  provide  young  people  with  the  resources  and 
support  they  need  and  deserve,  and  we  recommit  to  building  a  society 
in which all mentors and mentees can thrive in mutual learning relationships. 
By  sharing  their  own  stories  and  offering  guidance  and  advice,  mentors 
can  instill  a  sense  of  infinite  possibility  in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  their 
mentees, demonstrating that with hard work and passion, nothing is beyond 
their  potential.  Whether  simply  offering  a  compassionate  ear  or  actively 
teaching  and  inspiring  curiosity,  mentors  can  play  pivotal  roles  in  young 
peoples’  lives.  When  given  a  chance  to  use  their  talents  and  abilities  to 
engage  in  their  communities  and  contribute  to  our  world,  our  Nation’s 
youth  rise  to  the  challenge.  They  make  significant  impacts  in  their  commu-
nities and shape a brighter future for coming generations. 
My Administration is committed to fostering opportunities for mentorship— 
because  when  our  children  have  strong,  positive  role  models  to  look  up 
to,  they  grow  up  to  be  good  neighbors  and  good  fellow  citizens.  Through 
the  My  Brother’s  Keeper  initiative,  we  are  working  with  local  governments, 
businesses,  and  charitable  organizations  across  our  country  to  connect  more 
of  our  youth  to  effective  mentoring  programs  and  support  networks  to  rein-
force  the  fact  that  all  young  people  are  valued  and  to  empower  them  with 
the  skills  they  need  to  reach  their  full  potential.  We  have  achieved  the 
highest  high  school  graduation  rate  on  record—82  percent—and  we  remain 
focused on setting high standards that will help our students graduate ready 
for  college  and  careers.  In  addition,  we  are  supporting  job-driven  training 
initiatives  like  apprenticeships  so  our  doers  and  dreamers  can  earn  and 
learn  at  the  same  time.  And  through  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama’s  Reach 
Higher initiative, we are working to ensure every student has the opportunity 
to pursue their education and life goals. 
Every  young  person  can  benefit  from  having  a  mentor,  and  all  people  carry 
unique  ideas  and  experiences  they  can  employ  as  a  mentor.  I  encourage 
all Americans to visit www.Serve.gov/Mentor to learn more about opportuni-
ties  to  make  a  lasting  difference  in  the  lives  of  our  youth.  This  month, 
let  us  pledge  our  support  for  our  Nation’s  young  people,  and  let  us  honor 
those who give of themselves to uplift our next generation. Working together, 
we  can  provide  every  child  with  the  tools,  guidance,  and  confidence  they 
need to flourish and succeed.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9424  of  April  15,  2016 

National  Park  Week,  2016 

23415 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Our  National  Parks  have  allowed  generations  to  discover  history,  nature, 
and  wildlife  in  irreplaceable  ways.  From  the  highest  peaks  of  Denali  to 
the  lowest  dips  of  the  Grand  Canyon,  families  around  our  country  enjoy 
the splendor of the outdoors. Throughout National Park Week, as we celebrate 
the  ways  in  which  our  treasured  outdoor  spaces  enrich  our  lives  and  uplift 
our  spirits,  the  National  Park  Service  will  again  offer  free  admission  to 
America’s  National  Parks  so  more  people  can  explore  our  country’s  vast 
natural beauty. 

National  Parks  provide  unique  opportunities  to  connect  with  one  another 
and  the  world  around  us,  and  my  Administration  has  encouraged  more 
Americans  to  take  advantage  of  these  wonders.  Through  the  ‘‘Find  Your 
Park’’  campaign,  we  are  helping  more  people  visit  public  lands  and  land-
marks—from  State  and  local  parks  that  capture  our  Nation’s  natural  beauty 
to historical sites that offer unparalleled perspectives into our past. Whether 
breathtaking  sceneries  or  rushing  bodies  of  water,  our  National  Parks  have 
something  for  everyone—young  and  old—and  I  am  committed  to  helping 
all Americans discover the outdoors and interact with our unique and magical 
landscapes. 

Exposure  to  the  outdoors  can  stimulate  thought  and  inspiration,  and  my 
Administration  has  been  working  to  provide  more  of  our  young  people 
with  the  opportunity  to  grow  to  learn  and  love  our  National  Parks.  We 
launched the ‘‘Every Kid in a Park’’ initiative, giving all fourth grade students 
and  their  families  free  admission  to  our  parks  and  other  Federal  lands 
and  waters.  Our  parks  are  beloved  parts  of  America,  and  ensuring  their 
survival  for  generations  to  come  is  imperative,  which  is  why  I  have  acted 
to  protect  more  public  land  and  water  than  any  President  in  history— 
more  than  265  million  acres—and  I  have  called  on  the  Congress  to  boost 
maintenance  and  modernization  of  our  National  Parks  so  our  children  and 
grandchildren  will  be  able  to  enjoy  their  magnificence.  And  because  we 
must  protect  the  one  and  only  planet  we  have,  my  Administration  will 
continue working to combat climate change. 

This week, in honor of the upcoming National Park Service (NPS) centennial 
and the rich heritage the NPS has helped protect, let us embrace the oppor-
tunity  to  participate  in  a  variety  of  scientific,  artistic,  and  athletic  activities 
in  our  National  Parks.  And  together,  let  us  recommit  to  promoting  environ-
mental  stewardship  and  conserving  our  public  lands  so  all  our  daughters 
and  sons  can  experience  the  grandeur  of  our  outdoor  spaces  for  years  to 
come. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  16  through 
April  24,  2016,  as  National  Park  Week.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  visit 
their  National  Parks  and  be  reminded  of  these  unique  blessings  we  share 
as a Nation.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9503  of  September  26,  2016 

National  Voter  Registration  Day,  2016 

67089 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
One  of  the  most  fundamental  and  sacred  rights  of  any  democracy  is  the 
right to vote; in order for our government to function effectively and respond 
to  the  needs  of  our  people,  all  citizens  can  and  must  play  a  role  in  shaping 
it.  Each  year  on  National  Voter  Registration  Day,  we  reaffirm  the  strong 
sense  of  civic  pride  among  our  people  and  encourage  friends,  family  mem-
bers,  and  neighbors  to  get  involved  in  civic  life  by  registering  to  vote. 
Democracy  is  not  a  spectator  sport.  If  we  are  serious  about  improving  our 
country  and  ensuring  our  government  reflects  our  values,  we  cannot  afford 
to  sit  out  on  Election  Day.  Unfortunately,  among  those  who  are  eligible 
to  vote,  too  many  choose  not  to—far  too  many  people  disenfranchise  them-
selves  by  not  getting  involved.  When  we  do  not  take  full  advantage  of 
the  right  to  vote,  we  not  only  give  away  our  voice;  our  power;  our  ability 
to  shape  the  future  of  the  country  we  love—we  also  do  a  disservice  to 
the  generations  of  Americans  before  us  who  risked  everything,  including 
their lives, to protect this fundamental aspect of our Republic. 
Our  brand  of  democracy  is  hard,  and  it  requires  our  citizens  to  be  able 
to  fully  participate  in  a  smooth  and  effective  way.  Through  a  bipartisan, 
independent  commission  dedicated  to  improving  the  voting  process,  we 
are  working  to  ensure  our  democracy  and  our  elections  function  the  way 
they are supposed to. Whether through strengthening mechanisms that allow 
more  people  to  vote—such  as  online  registration—or  going  door-to-door 
to  register  voters  in  our  communities,  we  must  make  registering  to  vote 
easier.  By  protecting  and  expanding  this  right,  we  can  ensure  this  grand 
experiment in self-government works for more Americans. For more informa-
tion on how to register to vote, visit www.VOTE.USA.gov. 
It  is  easy  to  feel  frustrated  when  the  pace  of  change  is  slow—and  to  lose 
hope  in  the  political  process  as  a  result.  But  we  cannot  give  in  to  that 
cynicism.  Heroic  things  happen  when  people  get  involved.  Our  government 
is  only  as  strong  as  what  we  put  into  it,  and  it  is  only  reflective  of  the 
will  of  our  citizenry  when  we  exercise  our  right  to  vote.  Today,  as  we 
once  again  celebrate  National  Voter  Registration  Day,  let  us  carry  forward 
the tradition of promoting voter registration and civic engagement, recommit 
to exercising one of the most precious of our democratic rights, and remember 
that the task of perfecting our Union belongs to us all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  27,  2016, 
as  National  Voter  Registration  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe 
this day by ensuring they are registered to vote.

Proclamation  9463  of  June  16,  2016 

National  Week  of  Making,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The same American spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship that has steered 
our Nation through the industrial and digital revolutions—and led our people 
to  explore  the  depths  of  the  oceans  and  the  distant  planets  in  our  solar 
system—has  enabled  us  to  reimagine  our  world  through  new  ideas  and 
discoveries.  Since  our  earliest  days,  makers,  artists,  and  inventors  have 
driven  our  economy  and  transformed  how  we  live  by  taking  risks,  collabo-
rating,  and  drawing  on  their  talents  and  imaginations  to  make  our  Nation 
more  dynamic  and  interconnected.  During  National  Week  of  Making,  we 
recommit to sparking the creative confidence of all Americans and to giving 
them  the  skills,  mentors,  and  resources  they  need  to  harness  their  passion 
and tackle some of our planet’s greatest challenges. 
Today,  Americans  of  all  ages  have  the  ability  to  connect  and  showcase 
their  creativity  through  a  growing  maker  movement.  Technologies  like  3D 
printing and desktop machine tools are rapidly lowering the costs of produc-
tion; additional sources of capital such as crowdfunding are reducing barriers 
to  getting  started;  and  the  democratization  of  technology  is  empowering 
more  makers,  helping  to  boost  entrepreneurship  and  stimulate  American 
manufacturing. Over the last 6 years, we have added over 800,000 manufac-
turing  jobs  and  introduced  next-generation  manufacturing  hubs.  Just  as  the 
personal  computer  and  the  Internet  transformed  our  Nation  over  the  last 
several  decades,  these  new  opportunities  can  inspire  the  next  generation 
of  students,  innovators,  and  entrepreneurs  to  carry  forward  our  legacy  of 
ingenuity. 
In 2014, I launched the Nation of Makers initiative to ensure more Americans 
of  all  ages  and  backgrounds  have  greater  opportunities  to  design,  build, 
and  manufacture.  My  Administration  is  taking  steps  to  foster  ‘‘maker 
mindsets’’  by  promoting  skills  like  creative  problem-solving,  and  to  support 
the development of collaborative maker spaces so aspiring makers and manu-
facturers  can  turn  their  bold  ideas  into  realities.  I  am  proud  that  so  many 
people  across  our  country  have  already  joined  in  this  effort.  Mayors  have 
hosted  maker  roundtables  and  town  halls;  Federal  agencies  have  worked 
with  schools,  libraries,  recreation  centers,  and  museums  to  create  maker 
spaces,  curricula,  and  tools  to  help  students  learn  the  design  process;  and 
private businesses and other local collaborators have empowered individuals 
with the entrepreneurial resources and skills they need to launch companies 
and sell their products. 
Together  we  must  continue  to  expand  opportunity  for  generations  to  come 
by  working  to  eliminate  the  digital  divide  and  reduce  existing  skill  and 
confidence  gaps.  We  must  prepare  young  people  for  the  jobs  of  the  future 
by  equipping  them  with  the  analytical  skills  needed  to  solve  problems 
and  the  computer  science  and  hardware  development  skills  required  to 
power  our  innovation  economy.  It  is  critical  that  we  support  the  types 
of  hands-on  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  (STEM)  learning 
experiences—in  both  formal  and  informal  environments—that  students  en-
counter  through  making,  which  can  help  unlock  their  full  potential  and 
ignite  their  enthusiasm  for  the  careers  of  tomorrow.  That  is  why  we  are

prioritizing  investment  in  STEM  teaching  and  active  learning,  expanding 
access  to  rigorous  STEM  courses  like  computer  science,  encouraging  more 
opportunities in communities of greatest need, and working to get underrep-
resented  students,  including  women  and  minorities,  involved  to  increase 
diversity in STEM fields. 
Across  our  country,  Americans  are  attending  all  types  of  maker  events 
and  workshops—from  studios  in  small  towns  to  the  streets  of  our  Nation’s 
capital—to  share  their  incredible  inventions  and  ideas  with  others  and  to 
inspire  all  of  us  to  join  in  the  creative  process.  As  we  celebrate  the  power 
of  American  ingenuity,  I  invite  communities  to  build  on  this  progress  by 
encouraging  citizens  to  be  creators  and  by  working  together  to  ensure  that 
spaces  for  making  are  available  anywhere  Americans  live,  work,  play,  and 
learn.  This  week,  let  us  turn  today’s  sketches  and  dreams  into  tomorrow’s 
‘‘Made in America’’ labels, and let us embrace the audacious spirit of human 
curiosity that is embedded in our DNA. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  17  through 
June  23,  2016,  as  National  Week  of  Making.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  week  with  programs,  ceremonies,  celebrations,  and  activities 
that  encourage  a  new  generation  of  makers  and  manufacturers  to  share 
their talents, solutions, and skills. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  sixteenth  day 
of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

The  President

34859 

Proclamation  9454  of  May  26,  2016 

Prayer  for  Peace,  Memorial  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
With  courage  and  a  love  of  country  that  knows  no  limits,  America’s  men 
and women in uniform exemplify patriotism at its core—stepping into harm’s 
way to protect our people and to safeguard the ideals that have long sustained 
our  democracy.  Those  who  serve  under  the  stars  and  stripes  embody  the 
highest  form  of  citizenship,  and  on  Memorial  Day,  we  pay  solemn  tribute 
to  those  brave  Americans  who  laid  down  their  lives  to  defend  our  freedom. 
Since  America’s  earliest  days,  proud  patriots  have  forged  a  safer,  more 
secure  Nation,  and  though  battlefields  have  changed  and  technology  has 
evolved,  the  selflessness  of  our  service  members  has  remained  steadfast. 
They  have  stepped  forward  when  our  country  was  locked  in  revolution 
and  civil  war;  fought  threats  of  fascism  and  terrorism;  and  led  the  way 
in  securing  peace  and  stability  around  the  globe.  They  have  sacrificed  more 
than  most  of  us  could  ever  imagine—not  for  glory  or  gratitude,  but  for 
causes  greater  than  themselves.  In  the  children  who  replicate  their  courage 
and  strength,  in  the  spouses  and  partners  who  forever  seek  to  mend  their 
broken  hearts,  and  in  the  parents  who  mourn  the  absence  of  the  sons 
and  daughters  they  raised,  we  are  reminded  of  our  enduring  commitment 
to do right by our fallen warriors and their families. 
Those  who  gave  their  last  full  measure  of  devotion  for  the  values  that 
bind  us  as  one  people  deserve  our  utmost  respect  and  gratitude.  In  recog-
nizing  those  who  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice,  we  pledge  to  never  stop 
working  to  fulfill  our  obligations  to  all  members  of  our  Armed  Forces  so 
they  know  we  stand  beside  them  every  step  of  the  way—not  just  when 
we need them, but also when they need us. 
Today,  and  every  day,  let  us  remember  the  servicemen  and  women  we 
have  lost,  and  let  us  honor  them  by  rededicating  ourselves  to  strengthening 
our  Nation’s  promise.  With  love,  grace,  and  reflection,  let  us  honor  our 
fallen fellow Americans, known and unknown, who sacrificed their freedom 
to ensure our own. 
In  honor  of  all  of  our  fallen  service  members,  the  Congress,  by  a  joint 
resolution approved May 11, 1950, as amended (36 U.S.C. 116), has requested 
the  President  issue  a  proclamation  calling  on  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  observe  each  Memorial  Day  as  a  day  of  prayer  for  permanent 
peace  and  designating  a  period  on  that  day  when  the  people  of  the  United 
States  might  unite  in  prayer.  The  Congress,  by  Public  Law  106–579,  has 
also designated 3:00 p.m. local time on that day as a time for all Americans 
to observe, in their own way, the National Moment of Remembrance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  Memorial  Day,  May  30,  2016,  as  a  day 
of  prayer  for  permanent  peace,  and  I  designate  the  hour  beginning  in  each 
locality  at  11:00  a.m.  of  that  day  as  a  time  during  which  people  may 
unite in prayer. 
I  also  ask  all  Americans  to  observe  the  National  Moment  of  Remembrance 
beginning  at  3:00  p.m.  local  time  on  Memorial  Day.  I  request  the  Governors 
of  the  United  States  and  its  Territories,  and  the  appropriate  officials  of

Proclamation  9403  of  March  1,  2016 

Read  Across  America  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

From  a  child’s  first  foray  into  the  depths  of  a  story  to  an  adult’s  escape 
into  a  world  of  words,  reading  plays  an  integral  role  in  our  lives.  Works 
of  fiction  and  non-fiction  alike  pique  interest  and  inspiration  and  shape 
our  understanding  of  each  other  and  ourselves,  teaching  us  lessons  in  kind-
ness  and  humility,  responsibility  and  respect.  The  moment  we  persuade 
a  child  to  pick  up  a  book  for  the  first  time  we  change  their  lives  forever 
for  the  better,  and  on  Read  Across  America  Day,  we  recommit  to  getting 
literary works into our young peoples’ hands early and often. 

March 2 is also the birthday of one of America’s revered wordsmiths. Theodor 
Seuss  Geisel—or  Dr.  Seuss—used  his  incredible  talent  to  instill  in  his  most 
impressionable readers universal values we all hold dear. Through a prolific 
collection  of  stories,  he  made  children  see  that  reading  is  fun,  and  in 
the  process,  he  emphasized  respect  for  all;  pushed  us  to  accept  ourselves 
for  who  we  are;  challenged  preconceived  notions  and  encouraged  trying 
new  things;  and  by  example,  taught  us  that  we  are  limited  by  nothing 
but  the  range  of  our  aspirations  and  the  vibrancy  of  our  imaginations. 
And  for  older  lovers  of  literature,  he  reminded  us  not  to  take  ourselves 
too  seriously,  creating  wacky  and  wild  characters  and  envisioning  creative 
and colorful places. 

Books  reveal  unexplored  universes  and  stimulate  curiosity,  and  in  under-
served  communities,  they  play  a  particularly  important  role  in  prompting 
inquisition and encouraging ambition. Last month, the First Lady announced 
the  launch  of  Open  eBooks,  a  new  project  that  will  unlock  a  world  of 
learning  and  possibility  for  millions  of  American  children  and  provide  over 
$250  million  worth  of  reading  material  to  students  who  need  it  most.  As 
we  work  to  get  every  child  engrossed  in  literature,  we  honor  the  many 
people who devote their lives and careers to carrying forward this important 
cause—including  our  librarians,  educators,  and  parents.  We  can  all  get  lost 
in  a  good  read,  and  we  owe  it  to  rising  learners  to  give  them  the  chance 
to experience that same enjoyment and fulfillment. 

Today,  and  every  day,  let  us  celebrate  the  power  of  reading  by  promoting 
literacy  and  supporting  new  opportunities  for  students  to  plunge  into  the 
pages  of  a  book.  As  Dr.  Seuss  noted,  ‘‘The  more  that  you  read,  the  more 
things  you  will  know.  The  more  that  you  learn,  the  more  places  you’ll 
go.’’  Together,  we  can  help  all  children  go  plenty  of  places  along  their 
unending  journey  for  knowledge  and  ensure  everyone  can  find  joy  and 
satisfaction in the wonders of the written word. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2,  2016, 
as  Read  Across  America  Day.  I  call  upon  children,  families,  educators, 
librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to observe 
this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

The  President 

Thanksgiving  Day,  2016 

86553 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Nearly 400 years ago, a small band of Pilgrims fled persecution and violence 
and  came  to  this  land  as  refugees  in  search  of  opportunity  and  the  freedom 
to  practice  their  faith.  Though  the  journey  was  rough  and  their  first  winter 
harsh,  the  friendly  embrace  of  an  indigenous  people,  the  Wampanoag— 
who  offered  gracious  lessons  in  agriculture  and  crop  production—led  to 
their  successful  first  harvest.  The  Pilgrims  were  grateful  they  could  rely 
on  the  generosity  of  the  Wampanoag  people,  without  whom  they  would 
not have survived their first year in the new land, and together they celebrated 
this  bounty  with  a  festival  that  lasted  for  days  and  prompted  the  tradition 
of an annual day of giving thanks. 
This  history  teaches  us  that  the  American  instinct  has  never  been  to  seek 
isolation  in  opposite  corners;  it  is  to  find  strength  in  our  common  creed 
and  forge  unity  from  our  great  diversity.  On  that  very  first  thanksgiving 
celebration,  these  same  ideals  brought  together  people  of  different  back-
grounds  and  beliefs,  and  every  year  since,  with  enduring  confidence  in 
the  power  of  faith,  love,  gratitude,  and  optimism,  this  force  of  unity  has 
sustained  us  as  a  people.  It  has  guided  us  through  times  of  great  challenge 
and  change  and  allowed  us  to  see  ourselves  in  those  who  come  to  our 
shores  in  search  of  a  safer,  better  future  for  themselves  and  their  families. 
On  this  holiday,  we  count  our  blessings  and  renew  our  commitment  to 
giving  back.  We  give  thanks  for  our  troops  and  our  veterans—and  their 
families—who  give  of  themselves  to  protect  the  values  we  cherish;  for  the 
first  responders,  teachers,  and  engaged  Americans  who  serve  their  commu-
nities;  and  for  the  chance  to  live  in  a  country  founded  on  the  belief  that 
all of us are created equal. But on this day of gratitude, we are also reminded 
that  securing  these  freedoms  and  opportunities  for  all  our  people  is  an 
unfinished  task.  We  must  reflect  on  all  we  have  been  afforded  while  con-
tinuing  the  work  of  ensuring  no  one  is  left  out  or  left  behind  because 
of who they are or where they come from. 
For  generations,  our  Nation’s  progress  has  been  carried  forward  by  those 
who  act  on  the  obligations  we  have  to  one  another.  Each  year  on  Thanks-
giving,  the  selflessness  and  decency  of  the  American  people  surface  in 
food  banks  and  shelters  across  our  country,  in  time  spent  caring  for  the 
sick  and  the  stranger,  and  in  efforts  to  empathize  with  those  with  whom 
we  disagree  and  to  recognize  that  every  individual  is  worthy  of  compassion 
and care. As we gather in the company of our friends, families, and commu-
nities—just  as  the  Pilgrims  and  the  Wampanoag  did  centuries  ago—let  us 
strive to lift up others, promote tolerance and inclusiveness, and give thanks 
for the joy and love that surround all of us. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  24,  2016, 
as  a  National  Day  of  Thanksgiving.  I  encourage  the  people  of  the  United 
States to join together—whether in our homes, places of worship, community 
centers,  or  any  place  of  fellowship  for  friends  and  neighbors—and  give

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

59421 

Proclamation  9477  of  August  25,  2016 

Women’s  Equality  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Nearly one century ago, with boundless courage and relentless commitment, 
dedicated  women  who  had  marched,  advocated,  and  organized  for  the  right 
to  cast  a  vote  finally  saw  their  efforts  rewarded  on  August  26,  1920,  when 
the  19th  Amendment  was  certified  and  the  right  to  vote  was  secured.  In 
the  decades  that  followed,  that  precious  right  has  bolstered  generations 
of  women  and  empowered  them  to  stand  up,  speak  out,  and  steer  the 
country  they  love  in  a  more  equal  direction.  Today,  as  we  celebrate  the 
anniversary of this hard-won achievement and pay tribute to the trailblazers 
and  suffragists  who  moved  us  closer  to  a  more  just  and  prosperous  future, 
we resolve to protect this constitutional right and pledge to continue fighting 
for equality for women and girls. 
At  every  level  of  society,  women  are  leaders  at  the  forefront  of  progress. 
Serving as judges and Members of Congress, setting world records in sports, 
founding groundbreaking companies, and fighting on the front lines of com-
bat,  women  continue  to  tear  down  barriers  and  shatter  glass  ceilings— 
just  as  they  have  done  since  the  founding  of  our  Nation.  Yet  such  progress 
is  not  inevitable,  and  we  must  keep  moving  forward  on  our  journey  toward 
equality.  In  one  of  my  first  acts  as  President,  I  established  the  White  House 
Council on Women and Girls to provide a coordinated response to challenges 
confronted  by  women  and  girls,  ensuring  their  concerns  and  insights  are 
taken into account in our policies and programs. And this year, my Adminis-
tration  hosted  the  first-ever  United  State  of  Women  Summit  to  continue 
our  efforts  to  underscore  the  passion,  success,  and  ongoing  commitment 
of advocates dedicated to advancing gender equality and realizing a brighter 
future for women of all ages. 
No  woman  should  earn  less  than  a  man  for  doing  the  same  job—equal 
pay  for  equal  work  should  be  a  fundamental  principle  of  our  economy 
and  our  democracy.  That  is  why  the  first  bill  I  signed  into  law  as  President 
was  the  Lilly  Ledbetter  Fair  Pay  Act,  and  why  I  continue  to  call  on  the 
Congress  to  pass  the  Paycheck  Fairness  Act.  Women  make  up  roughly  half 
of  our  workforce,  and  we  need  to  invest  more  in  affordable,  high-quality 
childcare.  We  must  strengthen  paid  sick,  maternity,  and  family  leave— 
too  many  families  are  forced  to  make  difficult  choices  between  caring  for 
a  newborn  and  receiving  a  paycheck,  or  staying  home  to  help  a  sick  child 
or  parent  and  keeping  their  job.  And  we  must  continue  striving  for  fairness 
and  opportunity  when  it  comes  to  improving  workplace  policies,  because 
we know that when women succeed, our economy and our country succeed. 
Ensuring  all  young  women  can  live  full  and  healthy  lives  is  vital  to  their 
pursuit  of  personal  and  professional  goals.  Because  of  the  Affordable  Care 
Act,  individuals  can  no  longer  be  charged  higher  premiums  simply  for 
being  a  woman.  But  there  is  still  more  we  can  do  to  reduce  discrimination 
when  it  comes  to  women’s  health—such  as  protecting  a  woman’s  right 
to choose and safeguarding access to sexual and reproductive health services, 
including  abortion.  Every  person  should  be  able  to  live  and  reach  for  their 
dreams  free  from  fear  of  violence:  In  America,  nearly  one  in  four  women 
has suffered physical domestic violence, a cruelty which deprives its victims

of  their  autonomy,  liberty,  and  security,  and  inhibits  them  from  reaching 
their  full  potential.  Approximately  one  in  five  women  is  sexually  assaulted 
while  in  college.  Through  the  It’s  On  Us  campaign  and  the  White  House 
Task  Force  to  Protect  Students  From  Sexual  Assault,  we  have  called  on 
individuals,  communities,  and  institutions  of  higher  education  to  recognize 
what  they  can  do  to  stop  sexual  assault  and  change  our  culture  for  the 
better.  We  have  striven  to  support  survivors  and  focused  on  making  sure 
our  schools  are  safe  places  where  all  students  can  learn,  grow,  and  thrive. 
Transgender  women  often  face  escalated  levels  of  discrimination  and  vio-
lence,  and  we  have  taken  a  number  of  steps  to  secure  their  civil  rights, 
including providing guidance to educators that can help rid school environ-
ments  of  discrimination.  The  Department  of  Justice  has  also  urged  law 
enforcement  agencies  to  address  any  form  of  gender  bias  that  exists  in 
responding  to  domestic  violence  and  sexual  assault  and  ensure  that  such 
bias does not undermine efforts to keep victims safe. 
Underrepresented  in  management  positions,  underfunded  as  entrepreneurs, 
under-encouraged  in  STEM  fields,  and  confronted  with  higher  levels  of 
unemployment,  women  and  girls  of  color  still  face  very  real  challenges, 
significant  opportunity  gaps,  and  structural  barriers.  That  is  why  we  have 
hosted forums to discuss ways to increase programming and promote oppor-
tunities  for  women  and  girls  of  color  so  they  can  achieve  success  at  school, 
at  work,  and  in  their  communities.  To  continue  building  these  ladders 
of  opportunity  for  women—not  just  in  communities  across  our  country, 
but also around the world—I have made advancing gender equality a foreign 
policy  priority.  My  Administration  has  sought  to  end  gender-based  violence 
across the globe, promote the role of women in ending conflict and building 
lasting  peace  and  security,  and  empower  the  next  generation  by  investing 
in  adolescent  girls  and  breaking  down  barriers  to  get  62  million  girls  into 
schools through the Let Girls Learn initiative. 
In  the  many  decades  since  suffragists  organized  and  mobilized,  countless 
advocates  and  leaders  have  picked  up  the  mantle  and  moved  our  Nation 
and  our  world  forward.  Today,  young  women  in  America  grow  up  knowing 
an  historic  truth—that  not  only  can  they  cast  a  vote,  but  they  can  also 
run  for  office  and  help  shape  the  very  democracy  that  once  left  them 
out.  For  these  women,  and  for  generations  of  women  to  come,  we  must 
keep  building  a  more  equal  America—whether  through  the  stories  we  tell 
about our Nation’s history or the faces we display on our country’s currency. 
On  Women’s  Equality  Day,  as  we  recognize  the  accomplishments  that  so 
many women fought so hard to achieve, we rededicate ourselves to tackling 
the  challenges  that  remain  and  expanding  opportunity  for  women  and  girls 
everywhere. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  August  26,  2016, 
as  Women’s  Equality  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States 
to celebrate the achievements of women and promote gender equality.

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9462  of  June  15,  2016 

The  President 

World  Elder  Abuse  Awareness  Day,  2016 

39867 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Too  often,  elder  abuse,  neglect,  and  exploitation  threaten  the  livelihoods 
of  older  individuals  and  erode  their  extraordinary  potential.  One  in  ten 
seniors  in  America  experiences  mistreatment  or  abuse—including  domestic 
and  sexual  violence—and  because  these  incidents  are  vastly  underreported, 
only  a  limited  number  of  victims  are  able  to  get  the  help  they  need.  Today, 
we  join  our  international  partners  in  renewing  our  commitment  to  combat 
and  raise  awareness  of  elder  abuse,  and  in  striving  to  ensure  security  and 
dignity for all seniors. 
Worldwide, millions of people—predominantly women—experience different 
forms of elder abuse, including physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Theft, 
fraud,  and  other  types  of  financial  exploitation  also  affect  seniors  across 
socioeconomic  lines,  and  neglect  and  abandonment  can  cause  great  harm 
to vulnerable older individuals. My Administration is dedicated to addressing 
this  serious  problem  by  providing  care  to  survivors  of  abuse,  transforming 
our  Nation’s  criminal  justice  systems  to  better  understand  elder  abuse  as 
a  criminal  issue,  and  increasing  public  awareness  of  warning  signs  and 
prevention  strategies.  Additionally,  because  the  majority  of  elder  abuse  vic-
tims are women, we are working to support women domestically and abroad 
and to combat gender-based violence around the world. 
One  of  the  best  measures  of  a  country  is  how  it  treats  its  older  citizens. 
My  Administration  is  devoted  to  strengthening  Medicare,  Medicaid,  the 
Older  Americans  Act,  and  Social  Security.  Together,  these  programs  have 
significantly  reduced  the  rate  of  seniors  living  in  poverty,  helped  older 
Americans  access  health  care  and  quality  care  services,  and  allowed  older 
Americans to remain independent as they age. The Elder Justice Act, enacted 
as  part  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  took  new  steps  to  address  elder  abuse, 
neglect, and exploitation and established an Elder Justice Coordinating Coun-
cil  through  which  Federal  agencies  are  working  together  to  address  elder 
abuse  and  neglect.  And  our  commitment  to  supporting  survivors  of  all 
ages is reflected in the Violence Against Women Act, which dedicates Federal 
funds to victim service providers, law enforcement, and prosecutors working 
to  respond  to  domestic  and  sexual  violence  experienced  by  older  adults. 
Last  year,  I  was  proud  to  host  the  White  House  Conference  on  Aging  to 
identify  ways  we  can  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  older  Americans  and 
enable  them  to  live  in  retirement  with  dignity.  Held  once  a  decade,  this 
conference  brought  together  older  Americans,  their  families,  caregivers,  and 
advocates  to  focus  on  key  issue  areas,  including  the  importance  of  elder 
justice. In addition to taking new steps to expand protections against financial 
exploitation, assist victims of crimes, and review the science of understanding 
and preventing abuse through better screening tools, we have built on many 
of  the  Federal  efforts  already  underway  and  are  working  to  support  aging 
Americans for decades to come. 
On  World  Elder  Abuse  Awareness  Day,  let  us  resolve  to  give  all  people 
the  tools  and  support  they  need  to  live  out  their  golden  years  in  peace 
and  security.  Let  us  fight  cruelty  against  seniors  wherever  it  exists,  and

together,  let  us  stamp  out  all  forms  of  elder  abuse—here  at  home  and 
across the globe. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  15,  2016, 
as  World  Elder  Abuse  Awareness  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe 
this  day  by  learning  the  signs  of  elder  abuse,  neglect,  and  exploitation, 
and by raising awareness about this important public health issue. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  fifteenth  day 
of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Notice  of  May  3,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Ac-
tions  of  the  Government  of  Syria 

On  May  11,  2004,  pursuant  to  his  authority  under  the  International  Emer-
gency  Economic  Powers  Act,  50  U.S.C.  1701–1706,  and  the  Syria  Account-
ability  and  Lebanese  Sovereignty  Restoration  Act  of  2003,  Public  Law  108– 
175, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 13338, in which he declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  actions  of  the  Government  of 
Syria.  To  deal  with  this  national  emergency,  E.O.  13338  authorized  the 
blocking  of  property  of  certain  persons  and  prohibited  the  exportation  or 
re-exportation of certain goods to Syria. The national emergency was modified 
in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps  taken  in  E.O.  13399  of  April 
25,  2006,  E.O.  13460  of  February  13,  2008,  E.O.  13572  of  April  29,  2011, 
E.O.  13573  of  May  18,  2011,  E.O.  13582  of  August  17,  2011,  E.O.  13606 
of April 22, 2012, and E.O. 13608 of May 1, 2012. 

The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United 
States  constituted  by  the  actions  of  the  Government  of  Syria  in  supporting 
terrorism,  maintaining  its  then-existing  occupation  of  Lebanon,  pursuing 
weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  missile  programs,  and  undermining  U.S. 
and  international  efforts  with  respect  to  the  stabilization  and  reconstruction 
of Iraq. 

The  regime’s  brutality  and  repression  of  the  Syrian  people,  who  have  been 
calling  for  freedom  and  a  representative  government,  not  only  endangers 
the  Syrian  people  themselves,  but  also  is  generating  instability  throughout 
the  region.  The  Syrian  regime’s  actions  and  policies,  including  with  respect 
to  chemical  and  biological  weapons,  supporting  terrorist  organizations,  and 
obstructing  the  Lebanese  government’s  ability  to  function  effectively,  con-
tinue  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  As  a  result,  the  national 
emergency  declared  on  May  11,  2004,  and  the  measures  to  deal  with  that 
emergency  adopted  on  that  date  in  E.O.  13338;  on  April  25,  2006,  in  E.O. 
13399;  on  February  13,  2008,  in  E.O.  13460;  on  April  29,  2011,  in  E.O. 
13572;  on  May  18,  2011,  in  E.O.  13573;  on  August  17,  2011,  in  E.O.  13582; 
on  April  22,  2012,  in  E.O.  13606;  and  on  May  1,  2012,  in  E.O.  13608; 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  May  11,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act,  50  U.S.C.  1622(d), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  with  respect 
to the actions of the Government of Syria. 

In  addition,  the  United  States  condemns  the  Asad  regime’s  use  of  brutal 
violence  and  human  rights  abuses  and  calls  on  the  Asad  regime  to  stop 
its  violence  against  the  Syrian  people,  uphold  the  Cessation  of  Hostilities, 
enable  the  delivery  of  humanitarian  assistance,  and  allow  a  political  transi-
tion  in  Syria  that  will  forge  a  credible  path  to  a  future  of  greater  freedom, 
democracy, opportunity, and justice. 

The  United  States  will  consider  changes  in  the  composition,  policies,  and 
actions  of  the  Government  of  Syria  in  determining  whether  to  continue 
or terminate this national emergency in the future.

Notice  of  August  30,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Cer-
tain  Terrorist  Attacks 

Consistent  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act,  50  U.S.C. 
1622(d),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  previously  de-
clared  on  September  14,  2001,  in  Proclamation  7463,  with  respect  to  the 
terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  and  the  continuing  and  immediate 
threat of further attacks on the United States. 
Because  the  terrorist  threat  continues,  the  national  emergency  declared  on 
September  14,  2001,  and  the  powers  and  authorities  adopted  to  deal  with 
that  emergency  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  September  14,  2016.  There-
fore, I am continuing in effect for an additional year the national emergency 
that  was  declared  on  September  14,  2001,  with  respect  to  the  terrorist 
threat. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to

Delegation  of  Certain  Authorities  and  Assignment  of  Certain 
Functions  Under  the  Trade  Facilitation  and  Trade  Enforce-
ment  Act  of  2015 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  the  Trade  Facilitation  and 
Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (the ‘‘Act’’) (Public Law 114–125) and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby order as follows: 
Section  1.  Authorities  and  Functions  under  the  Act.  (a)  The  functions  of 
the  President  under  section  2313A(b)  of  the  Export  Enhancement  Act  of 
1988,  as  added  by  section  504  of  the  Act,  are  assigned  to  the  Secretary 
of  Commerce.  In  carrying  out  its  functions,  the  State  and  Federal  Export 
Promotion Coordination Working Group established by the Secretary of Com-
merce  under  this  section  shall  also  coordinate  with  local  and  municipal 
governments representing regionally diverse areas. 

(b)  The  functions  of  the  President  under  section  909(d)  of  the  Act  are 
assigned to the Secretary of State, in consultation with other relevant Federal 
agencies. 

(c)  The  functions  of  the  President  under  section  915(d)  of  the  Act  are 
assigned  to  the  Administrator  of  the  United  States  Agency  for  International 
Development,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  United 
States Trade Representative (U.S. Trade Representative). 

(d)  The  functions  of  the  President  under  section  915(e)  of  the  Act  are 
assigned to the U.S. Trade Representative, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State. 
Sec.  2.  Engagement  on  Currency  Exchange  Rate  and  Economic  Policies. 
(a)  Prior  to  undertaking  an  enhanced  analysis  of  a  country  pursuant  to 
section  701(a)(2)(A)(ii)  of  the  Act,  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  shall  seek 
the  views  of  the  U.S.  Trade  Representative  on  changes  in  trade  restrictions 
in that country. 

(b)  In  exercising  the  functions  under  section  701(b)(2)(A)  of  the  Act,  the 
Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with the Secretary of State in making 
any  determination  that  commencing  enhanced  bilateral  engagement  with 
a  country  would  cause  serious  harm  to  the  national  security  of  the  United 
States. 

(c) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines, pursuant to section 701(c)(1) 
of  the  Act,  that  a  country  has  failed  to  adopt  appropriate  policies  to  correct 
the  undervaluation  and  surpluses  described  in  section  701(b)(1)(A)  of  the 
Act with respect to that country, the Assistant to the President for Economic 
Policy,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  the  U.S.  Trade 
Representative,  the  Secretary  of  State,  and  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  shall 
make  a  recommendation  to  the  President  regarding  which  of  the  actions 
set forth in sections 701(c)(1)(A) through (D) of the Act the President should 
take,  or  whether  the  President  should  waive,  pursuant  to  section  701(c)(2) 
of the Act, the requirement to take remedial action. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  In  exercising  authority  delegated  by  or  per-
forming functions assigned in this order, the Secretaries of State, the Treasury, 
and Commerce and the U.S. Trade Representative and their delegees:

Proclamation  9388  of  January  11,  2016 

To  Take  Certain  Actions  Under  the  African  Growth  and  Op-
portunity  Act 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  In  Proclamation  7350  of  October  2,  2000,  the  President  designated  the 
Republic of South Africa (South Africa) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country  for  purposes  of  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974  (the 
‘‘1974 Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106–200) (AGOA). 
2. Sections 506A(d)(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(d)(4)(C)) and 506A(c)(1) (19 U.S.C. 
2466a(c)(1))  of  the  1974  Act  authorize  the  President  to  suspend  the  applica-
tion  of  duty-free  treatment  provided  for  any  article  described  in  section 
506A(b)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2466a(b)(1))  or  19  U.S.C.  3721  with 
respect  to  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country  if  he  determines  that 
the beneficiary country is not meeting the requirements described in section 
506A(a)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  and  that  suspending  such  duty-free  treatment 
would  be  more  effective  in  promoting  compliance  by  the  country  with 
those  requirements  than  terminating  the  designation  of  the  country  as  a 
beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country  for  purposes  of  section  506A  of 
the 1974 Act. 
3.  Pursuant  to  section  506A(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined  that 
South Africa is not meeting the requirements described in section 506A(a)(1) 
of  the  1974  Act  and  that  suspending  the  application  of  duty-free  treatment 
to certain goods would be more effective in promoting compliance by South 
Africa  with  such  requirements  than  terminating  the  designation  of  South 
Africa  as  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country.  Accordingly,  I  have 
decided  to  suspend  the  application  of  duty-free  treatment  for  all  AGOA- 
eligible  goods  in  the  agricultural  sector  from  South  Africa  for  purposes 
of section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016. 
4.  Section  604  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2483)  authorizes  the  President 
to  embody  in  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  of  the  United  States  (HTS) 
the  substance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  and  of  other  Acts 
affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including removal, modi-
fication,  continuance,  or  imposition  of  any  rate  of  duty  or  other  import 
restriction. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  but  not  limited 
to  sections  506A(d)(4)(C),  506A(c)(1),  and  604  of  the  1974  Act,  do  proclaim 
that: 

(1)  The  application  of  duty-free  treatment  for  all  AGOA-eligible  goods 
in  the  agricultural  sector  from  South  Africa  is  suspended  for  purposes  of 
section 506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016. 

(2)  In  order  to  reflect  in  the  HTS  that  beginning  on  March  15,  2016, 
the  application  of  duty-free  treatment  for  all  AGOA-eligible  goods  in  the 
agricultural sector from South Africa shall be suspended, the HTS is modified 
as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation.

Presidential Documents

92499 

Proclamation  9555  of  December  15,  2016 

To  Implement  the  Nepal  Preference  Program  and  for  Other 
Purposes 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  Section  915(b)  of  the  Trade  Facilitation  and  Trade  Enforcement  Act  of 
2015  (the  ‘‘TFTEA’’)  (19  U.S.C.  4454)  confers  authority  upon  the  President 
to  provide  preferential  treatment  for  eligible  articles  imported  directly  from 
Nepal  into  the  customs  territory  of  the  United  States  if  the  President  deter-
mines  that  Nepal  meets  the  eligibility  requirements  specified  in  section 
915(b)(1)(A) of the TFTEA, taking into account the factors specified in section 
915(b)(1)(B) of the TFTEA. 
2.  Pursuant  to  section  915(b)  of  the  TFTEA,  I  have  determined  that  Nepal 
meets the eligibility requirements of section 915(b)(1)(A), taking into account 
the factors specified in section 915(b)(1)(B). 
3.  Section  915(c)  of  the  TFTEA  describes  the  requirements  for  articles  from 
Nepal  to  be  considered  eligible  for  duty-free  treatment.  Pursuant  to  section 
915(c)(2)(A)(iv)  of  the  TFTEA,  the  President  may  designate  certain  articles 
as eligible for duty-free treatment when imported from Nepal if, after receiv-
ing the advice of the United States International Trade Commission (Commis-
sion)  in  accordance  with  section  503(e)  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974  (the 
‘‘Trade Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), the President determines that such articles 
are not import-sensitive in the context of imports from Nepal. 
4.  Pursuant  to  sections  915(c)(2)(A)(iv)  of  the  TFTEA,  and  after  receiving 
advice from the Commission in accordance with section 503(e) of the Trade 
Act,  I  have  determined  to  designate  the  articles  included  in  Annex  I  of 
this  proclamation  as  eligible  for  duty-free  treatment  when  imported  from 
Nepal. 
5.  Section  604  of  the  Trade  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2483),  as  amended,  authorizes 
the  President  to  embody  in  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedules  of  the  United 
States (the ‘‘HTS’’) (19 U.S.C. 1202) the substance of the relevant provisions 
of  the  Trade  Act  and  of  other  Acts  affecting  import  treatment,  and  actions 
thereunder,  including  removal,  modification,  continuance,  or  imposition  of 
any rate of duty or other import restriction. 
6.  In  order  to  implement  the  duty-free  treatment  provided  in  accordance 
with  the  provisions  of  the  TFTEA,  it  is  necessary  to  modify  the  HTS, 
thus  incorporating  the  substance  of  relevant  provisions  of  the  TFTEA,  and 
of  actions  taken  thereunder,  into  the  HTS,  pursuant  to  section  604  of  the 
Trade Act. 
7.  In  Proclamation  7748  of  December  30,  2003,  President  Bush  determined 
that  the  Central  African  Republic  was  not  making  continual  progress  in 
meeting  the  requirements  described  in  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  Trade  Act 
(19  U.S.C.  2466a(a)),  as  added  by  section  111(a)  of  the  African  Growth 
and  Opportunity  Act  (the  ‘‘AGOA’’).  Thus,  pursuant  to  section  506A(a)(3) 
of  the  Trade  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2466a(a)(3)),  President  Bush  terminated  the 
designation  of  the  Central  African  Republic  as  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan 
African country for purposes of section 506A of the Trade Act. 
8.  Section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  Trade  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  designate 
a country listed in section 107 of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3706) as a ‘‘beneficiary

sub-Saharan  African  country’’  if  the  President  determines  that  the  country 
meets  the  eligibility  requirements  set  forth  in  section  104  of  the  AGOA 
(19  U.S.C.  3703),  as  well  as  the  eligibility  criteria  set  forth  in  section  502 
of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2462). 
9.  Pursuant  to  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  Trade  Act,  based  on  actions  that 
the  Central  African  Republic  has  taken,  I  have  determined  that  the  Central 
African  Republic  meets  the  eligibility  requirements  set  forth  in  section  104 
of  the  AGOA  and  the  eligibility  criteria  set  forth  in  section  502  of  the 
Trade  Act,  and  I  have  decided  to  designate  the  Central  African  Republic 
as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. 
10. On April 22, 1985, the United States and Israel entered into the Agreement 
on  the  Establishment  of  a  Free  Trade  Area  between  the  Government  of 
the  United  States  of  America  and  the  Government  of  Israel  (the  ‘‘USIFTA’’), 
which  the  Congress  approved  in  section  3  of  the  United  States-Israel  Free 
Trade  Area  Implementation  Act  of  1985  (the  ‘‘USIFTA  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C. 
2112 note). 
11.  Section  4(b)  of  the  USIFTA  Act  provides  that,  whenever  the  President 
determines  that  it  is  necessary  to  maintain  the  general  level  of  reciprocal 
and  mutually  advantageous  concessions  with  respect  to  Israel  provided  for 
by  the  USIFTA,  the  President  may  proclaim  such  withdrawal,  suspension, 
modification,  or  continuance  of  any  duty,  or  such  continuance  of  existing 
duty-free  or  excise  treatment,  or  such  additional  duties,  as  the  President 
determines to be required or appropriate to carry out the USIFTA. 
12. In order to maintain the general level of reciprocal and mutually advan-
tageous  concessions  with  respect  to  agricultural  trade  with  Israel,  on  July 
27, 2004, the United States entered into an agreement with Israel concerning 
certain  aspects  of  trade  in  agricultural  products  during  the  period  January 
1, 2004, through December 31, 2008 (the ‘‘2004 US-Israel Agreement’’). 
13.  In  Proclamation  7826  of  October  4,  2004,  consistent  with  the  2004 
US-Israel  Agreement,  President  Bush  determined,  pursuant  to  section  4(b) 
of the USIFTA Act, that, in order to maintain the general level of reciprocal 
and  mutually  advantageous  concessions  with  respect  to  Israel  provided  for 
by the USIFTA, it was necessary to provide duty-free access into the United 
States through December 31, 2008, for specified quantities of certain agricul-
tural products of Israel. 
14.  Each  year  from  2008  through  2015,  the  United  States  and  Israel  entered 
into  agreements  to  extend  the  period  that  the  2004  US-Israel  Agreement 
was  in  force  for  1-year  periods  to  allow  additional  time  for  the  two  govern-
ments  to  conclude  an  agreement  to  replace  the  2004  US-Israel  Agreement. 
15.  To  carry  out  the  extension  agreements,  the  President  in  Proclamation 
8334 of December 31, 2008; Proclamation 8467 of December 23, 2009; Procla-
mation  8618  of  December  21,  2010;  Proclamation  8770  of  December  29, 
2011; Proclamation 8921 of December 20, 2012; Proclamation 9072 of Decem-
ber  23,  2013;  Proclamation  9223  of  December  23,  2014;  and  Proclamation 
9383  of  December  21,  2015,  modified  the  HTS  to  provide  duty-free  access 
into the United States for specified quantities of certain agricultural products 
of Israel, each time for an additional 1-year period. 
16.  On  December  5,  2016,  the  United  States  entered  into  an  agreement 
with  Israel  to  extend  the  period  that  the  2004  US-Israel  Agreement  is  in 
force  through  December  31,  2017,  and  to  allow  for  further  negotiations 
on an agreement to replace the 2004 US-Israel Agreement. 
17.  Pursuant  to  section  4(b)  of  the  USIFTA  Act,  I  have  determined  that 
it  is  necessary,  in  order  to  maintain  the  general  level  of  reciprocal  and 
mutually  advantageous  concessions  with  respect  to  Israel  provided  for  by 
the  USIFTA,  to  provide  duty-free  access  into  the  United  States  through 
the close of December 31, 2017, for specified quantities of certain agricultural 
products of Israel.

18.  Section  1206(a)  of  the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988 
(the  ‘‘1988  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  3006(a))  authorizes  the  President  to  proclaim 
modifications to the HTS based on the recommendations of the Commission 
under  section  1205  of  the  1988  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3005)  if  he  determines 
that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations under 
the  International  Convention  on  the  Harmonized  Commodity  Description 
and  Coding  System  (Convention)  and  do  not  run  counter  to  the  national 
economic  interest  of  the  United  States.  In  2006  and  2011,  the  Commission 
recommended  modifications  to  the  HTS  pursuant  to  section  1205  of  the 
1988  Act  to  conform  the  HTS  to  amendments  made  to  the  Convention. 
In  Proclamation  8097  of  December  29,  2006,  and  Proclamation  8771  of 
December  29,  2011,  President  Bush  and  I,  respectively,  modified  the  HTS 
pursuant to section 1206 of the 1988 Act to conform the HTS to the amend-
ments to the Convention. 
19. Proclamation 8332 of December 29, 2008, implemented the United States- 
Oman  Free  Trade  Agreement  (the  ‘‘USOFTA’’)  with  respect  to  the  United 
States  and,  pursuant  to  section  201  of  the  United  States-Oman  Free  Trade 
Agreement  Implementation  Act  (the  ‘‘USOFTA  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  3805  note), 
the  staged  reductions  in  rates  of  duty  that  President  Bush  determined  to 
be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  2.3,  2.5,  2.6, 
3.2.8,  and  3.2.9,  and  the  schedule  of  duty  reductions  with  respect  to  Oman 
set forth in Annex 2–B of the USOFTA. 
20.  In  order  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  the  staged  reductions  in  rates 
of  duty  for  originating  goods  from  Oman  in  categories  that  were  modified 
to conform to the Convention, President Bush and I proclaimed in Proclama-
tion  8097  and  Proclamation  8771,  respectively,  modifications  to  the  HTS 
that  we  determined  were  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  the  duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332. 
21.  The  United  States  and  Oman  are  parties  to  the  Convention.  Because 
the substance of changes to the Convention are reflected in slightly differing 
form  in  the  national  tariff  schedules  of  the  United  States  and  Oman,  the 
rules  of  origin  set  out  in  Annex  3–A  and  Annex  4–A  of  the  USOFTA 
must be changed to ensure that the tariff and certain other treatment accorded 
under the USOFTA to originating goods will continue to be provided under 
the  tariff  categories  that  were  modified  in  Proclamation  8097  and  Proclama-
tion 8771. The United States and Oman have agreed to make these changes. 
22.  Section  202  of  the  USOFTA  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3805  note)  provides  certain 
rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes 
of  implementing  preferential  tariff  treatment  under  the  USOFTA.  Section 
202(j)  of  the  USOFTA  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  proclaim  the  rules 
of  origin  set  out  in  the  USOFTA  and  any  subordinate  tariff  categories  nec-
essary  to  carry  out  the  USOFTA,  subject  to  the  exceptions  stated  in  section 
202(j)(2)(A) of the USOFTA Act. 
23. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant 
to  section  202  of  the  USOFTA  Act  and  section  1206(a)  of  the  1988  Act 
are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  tariff  and  certain 
other  treatment  accorded  originating  goods  under  tariff  categories  modified 
in  Proclamation  8097  and  Proclamation  8771  and  to  carry  out  the  duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8332. 
24.  Section  604  of  the  Trade  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  embody  in 
the  HTS  the  substance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  and  of  other 
Acts  affecting  import  treatment,  and  actions  thereunder,  including  removal, 
modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import 
restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(c)), as amended, 
provides that modifications proclaimed by the President may not take effect 
before  the  thirtieth  day  after  the  date  on  which  the  text  of  the  proclamation 
is published in the Federal Register. 
25.  Proclamation  8894  of  October  29,  2012,  implemented  the  United  States- 
Panama  Trade  Promotion  Agreement  (the  ‘‘USPTPA’’)  with  respect  to  the

United  States  and,  pursuant  to  section  201  of  the  United  States-Panama 
Trade  Promotion  Agreement  Implementation  Act  (the  ‘‘USPTPA  Act’’)  (19 
U.S.C. 3805 note), the staged reductions in duty that the President determined 
to  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  3.3,  3.5,  3.6, 
3.26,  3.27,  3.28,  and  3.29,  and  the  schedule  of  duty  reductions  with  respect 
to Panama set forth in Annex 3.3 of the USPTPA. 
26.  The  United  States  and  Panama  are  parties  to  the  Convention.  Because 
changes to the Convention are reflected in slight differences of form between 
the  national  tariff  schedules  of  the  United  States  and  Panama,  the  rules 
of  origin  set  out  in  Annex  4.1  of  the  USPTPA  must  be  changed  to  ensure 
that  the  tariff  and  certain  other  treatment  accorded  under  the  USPTPA 
Act  to  originating  goods  will  continue  to  be  provided  under  the  tariff  cat-
egories  that  were  proclaimed  in  Proclamation  8894.  The  United  States  and 
Panama have agreed to make these changes. 
27.  Section  202  of  the  USPTPA  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3805  note)  provides  certain 
rules for determining whether a good is an originating good for the purposes 
of  implementing  tariff  treatment  under  the  USPTPA.  Section  202(o)  of  the 
USPTPA  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  proclaim  the  rules  of  origin  set 
out  in  the  USPTPA  and  any  subordinate  tariff  categories  necessary  to  carry 
out  the  USPTPA,  subject  to  the  exceptions  stated  in  section  202(o)  of  the 
USPTPA Act. 
28. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant 
to  section  202  of  the  USPTPA  Act  and  section  1206(a)  of  the  1988  Act 
are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  tariff  and  certain 
other  treatment  accorded  originating  goods  under  tariff  categories  modified 
in  Proclamation  8097  and  Proclamation  8771  and  to  carry  out  the  duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 8894. 
29.  Section  604  of  the  Trade  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  embody  in 
the  HTS  the  substance  of  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  or  other  Acts 
affecting  import  treatment,  and  of  actions  taken  thereunder,  including  re-
moval, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications 
proclaimed  by  the  President  may  not  take  effect  before  the  thirtieth  day 
after  the  date  on  which  the  text  of  the  proclamation  is  published  in  the 
Federal Register. 
30.  Proclamation  7987  of  February  28,  2006,  implemented  the  Dominican 
Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (the ‘‘CAFTA- 
DR’’)  with  respect  to  the  United  States  and,  pursuant  to  section  201  of 
the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement 
Implementation  Act  (the  ‘‘CAFTA-DR  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  4031),  the  staged 
reductions  in  duty  that  the  President  determined  to  be  necessary  or  appro-
priate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  3.3,  3.5,  3.6,  3.21,  3.26,  3.27,  and 
3.28,  and  Annexes  3.3  (including  the  schedule  of  United  States  duty  reduc-
tions  with  respect  to  originating  goods),  3.27,  and  3.28  of  the  CAFTA- 
DR. 
31.  The  United  States,  Costa  Rica,  the  Dominican  Republic,  El  Salvador, 
Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua (the ‘‘CAFTA-DR countries’’) are parties 
to the Convention. Because changes to the Convention are reflected in slight 
differences  of  form  between  the  national  tariff  schedules  of  the  United 
States  and  the  other  CAFTA-DR  countries,  Annexes  4.1,  3.25,  and  3.29 
of  the  CAFTA-DR  must  be  changed  to  ensure  that  the  tariff  and  certain 
other  treatment  accorded  under  the  CAFTA-DR  to  originating  goods  will 
continue  to  be  provided  under  the  tariff  categories  that  were  proclaimed 
in Proclamation 7987. The United States and the other CAFTA-DR countries 
have agreed to make these changes. 
32.  Section  201  of  the  CAFTA-DR  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  proclaim 
such  modifications  or  continuation  of  any  duty,  such  continuation  of  duty- 
free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines 
to  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  3.3,  3.5,  3.6,

United  States  duty  reductions  with  respect  to  originating  goods),  3.27,  and 
3.28 of the CAFTA-DR. 
33. I have determined that the modifications to the HTS proclaimed pursuant 
to  section  201  of  the  CAFTA-DR  Act  and  section  1206(a)  of  the  1988  Act 
are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  tariff  and  certain 
other  treatment  accorded  originating  goods  under  tariff  categories  modified 
in  Proclamation  8097  and  Proclamation  8771  and  to  carry  out  the  duty 
reductions proclaimed in Proclamation 7987. 
34.  Section  604  of  the  Trade  Act  authorizes  the  President  to  embody  in 
the  HTS  the  substance  of  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  or  other  Acts 
affecting  import  treatment,  and  of  actions  taken  thereunder,  including  re-
moval, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other 
import restriction. Section 1206(c) of the 1988 Act provides that modifications 
proclaimed  by  the  President  may  not  take  effect  before  the  thirtieth  day 
after  the  date  on  which  the  text  of  the  proclamation  is  published  in  the 
Federal Register. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  but  not  limited 
to  section  915  of  the  TFTEA  (19  U.S.C.  4454),  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the 
Trade  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2466a(a));  section  4(b)  of  the  USIFTA  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2112  note);  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States  Code;  section  1206(a)  of 
the  1988  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3006(a));  section  202  of  the  USOFTA  Act  (19 
U.S.C.  3805  note);  section  202  of  the  USPTPA  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3805  note); 
section  201  of  the  CAFTA-DR  Act  (19  U.S.C.  4031);  and  section  604  of 
the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that: 

(1)  In  order  to  provide  for  the  preferential  treatment  provided  for  in 
section  915  of  the  TFTEA,  the  HTS  is  modified  as  provided  in  Annex 
I  to  this  proclamation.  The  modifications  to  the  HTS  set  forth  in  Annex 
I shall continue in effect through December 31, 2025. 
(2) The Central African Republic is designated as a beneficiary sub-Saharan 
African country. 
(3)  In  order  to  reflect  this  designation  in  the  HTS,  general  note  16(a) 
and  U.S.  note  1  to  subchapter  XIX  of  chapter  98  to  the  HTS  are  each 
modified  by  inserting  in  alphabetical  sequence  in  the  list  of  beneficiary 
sub-Saharan  African  countries  ‘‘Central  African  Republic.’’  Further,  note 
2(d) to subchapter XIX of chapter 98 is modified by inserting in alphabetical 
sequence  in  the  list  of  lesser  developed  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African 
countries ‘‘Central African Republic.’’ 
(4)  In  order  to  implement  U.S.  tariff  commitments  under  the  2004  US- 
Israel  Agreement  through  December  31,  2017,  the  HTS  is  modified  as 
provided in Annex II to this proclamation. 
(5) The modifications to the HTS set forth in Annex II to this proclamation 
shall  be  effective  with  respect  to  eligible  agricultural  products  of  Israel 
that  are  entered,  or  withdrawn  from  warehouse  for  consumption,  on  or 
after January 1, 2017. 
(6) The provisions of subchapter VII of chapter 99 of the HTS, as modified 
by Annex II to this proclamation, shall continue in effect through December 
31, 2017. 
(7)  In  order  to  reflect  in  the  HTS  the  modifications  to  the  rules  of  origin 
under  the  USOFTA,  general  note  31  to  the  HTS  is  modified  as  provided 
in Annex III to this proclamation. 
(8)  The  modifications  and  technical  rectifications  to  the  HTS  set  forth 
in  Annex  III  to  this  proclamation  shall  be  effective  with  respect  to  goods

later  of  (i)  February  1,  2017,  or  (ii)  the  thirtieth  day  after  the  date  of

44129 

Proclamation  9466  of  June  30,  2016 

To  Implement  the  World  Trade  Organization  Declaration  on 
the  Expansion  of  Trade  in  Information  Technology  Products 
and  for  Other  Purposes 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  On  July  28,  2015,  the  United  States  and  other  Members  of  the  World 
Trade  Organization  (WTO)  issued  a  Declaration  on  the  Expansion  of  Trade 
in Information Technology Products (Declaration), which established a frame-
work for eliminating duties on certain information and communication tech-
nology products. These products include advanced semiconductors, medical 
equipment,  and  a  range  of  audio  and  video  equipment.  The  Declaration 
sets  forth  commitments  for  immediate  or  staged  elimination  of  duties  on 
the covered products, expanding on duty-elimination commitments set forth 
in the 1996 Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products, which 
the  United  States  implemented  in  Proclamation  7011  of  June  30,  1997. 
2.  On  December  16,  2015,  the  United  States  and  other  WTO  Members 
issued a Ministerial Declaration in which ministers endorsed the Declaration 
of  July  28,  2015,  and  acknowledged  that  the  conditions  for  implementation 
had been met. 
3.  Section  111(b)  of  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act  (URAA)  (19  U.S.C. 
3521(b))  authorizes  the  President  to  proclaim  the  modification  of  any  duty 
or  staged  rate  reduction  of  any  duty  set  forth  in  Schedule  XX  for  products 
in  tariff  categories  that  were  the  subject  of  reciprocal  duty  elimination  or 
harmonization  negotiations  during  the  Uruguay  Round,  if  the  United  States 
agrees  to  such  action  in  a  multilateral  negotiation  under  the  auspices  of 
the  WTO,  and  after  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  section  115  of 
the  URAA  (19  U.S.C.  3524).  The  products  covered  by  the  Declaration  were 
the  subject  of  reciprocal  duty  elimination  negotiations  during  the  Uruguay 
Round,  and  the  requirements  of  section  115  of  the  URAA  have  been  met. 
4.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  section  111(b)  of  the  URAA,  I  have  determined 
to  proclaim  modifications  to  the  tariff  categories  and  rates  of  duty  set  forth 
in  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  (HTS),  as  set  forth  in  Annexes  I  and 
II to this proclamation. 
5.  Section  103(a)  of  the  Trade  Preferences  Extension  Act  of  2015  (TPEA) 
(Public  Law  114–27)  amended  section  506B  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974  (the 
‘‘1974 Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 2466b) and section 103(b)(1) amended section 112(g) 
of  the  African  Growth  and  Opportunity  Act  (AGOA)  (19  U.S.C.  3721(g)), 
to  provide  that  in  the  case  of  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country, 
duty-free  treatment  provided  under  title  V  of  the  1974  Act  shall  remain 
in effect through September 30, 2025. 
6. Accordingly, pursuant to section 506B of the 1974 Act and section 112(g) 
of  the  AGOA,  I  have  determined  that  general  note  16(c)  of  the  HTS  is 
modified  by  striking  ‘‘September  30,  2015’’  and  by  inserting  in  lieu  thereof 
‘‘September 30, 2025’’. 
7. Section 103(b)(2) of the TPEA amended section 112(b)(3)(A) of the AGOA 
(19  U.S.C.  3721(b)(3)(A))  to  extend  the  regional  apparel  article  program 
and  section  103(b)(3)  of  the  TPEA  amended  section  112(c)(1)  of  the  AGOA

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  129 / Wednesday,  July  6,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

(19  U.S.C.  3721(c)(1))  to  extend  the  third-country  fabric  program  through 
September 30, 2025. 
8. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 112(b)(3)(A) and 112(c)(1) of the AGOA, 
I  have  determined  that  chapter  98,  subchapter  XIX,  U.S.  note  2(b)  of  the 
HTS is modified by striking ‘‘September 30, 2015’’ where stated in ‘‘through 
the  period  October  1,  2014  through  September  30,  2015’’  and  in  ‘‘each 
1-year  period  thereafter  through  September  30,  2015’’  and  by  inserting  in 
lieu thereof ‘‘September 30, 2025’’. 
9. Section 104(c) of the TPEA authorizes the President to proclaim modifica-
tions  that  may  be  necessary  to  add  the  special  tariff  treatment  symbol  ‘‘D’’ 
in  the  ‘‘Special’’  subcolumn  of  the  HTS  for  each  article  classified  under 
a  heading  or  subheading  with  the  special  tariff  treatment  symbol  ‘‘A’’  or 
‘‘A*’’ in the ‘‘Special’’ subcolumn of the HTS. 
10.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  section  104(c)  of  the  TPEA,  I  have  determined 
it  is  necessary  to  add  the  special  tariff  treatment  symbol  ‘‘D’’  in  the  HTS 
as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation. 
11.  Pursuant  to  sections  501  and  503(a)(1)(B)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2461 and 2463(a)(1)(B)), the President may designate certain articles as eligi-
ble  for  preferential  tariff  treatment  under  the  Generalized  System  of  Pref-
erences (GSP) when imported from a least-developed beneficiary developing 
country if, after receiving the advice of the United States International Trade 
Commission  (Commission),  the  President  determines  that  such  articles  are 
not  import-sensitive  in  the  context  of  imports  from  least-developed  bene-
ficiary developing countries. 
12.  Pursuant  to  sections  501,  503(a)(1)(B),  and  503(b)(5)  of  the  1974  Act 
(19  U.S.C.  2461,  2463(a)(1)(b),  and  2463(b)(5)),  and  after  receiving  advice 
from  the  Commission  in  accordance  with  section  503(e)  of  the  1974  Act 
(19 U.S.C. 2463(e)), I have determined to designate certain articles as eligible 
articles  when  imported  from  a  least-developed  beneficiary  developing  coun-
try. 
13.  Pursuant  to  sections  503(b)(1)(E)  and  506A(b)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19 
U.S.C.  2463(b)(1)(E)  and  2466A(b)(1)),  the  President  may  designate  certain 
articles  as  eligible  for  preferential  tariff  treatment  under  the  AGOA  when 
the  articles  are  the  growth,  product,  or  manufacture  of  a  beneficiary  sub- 
Saharan  African  country  if,  after  receiving  the  advice  of  the  Commission, 
the  President  determines  that  such  articles  are  not  import-sensitive  in  the 
context of imports from beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries. 
14.  Pursuant  to  sections  503(b)(1)(E)  and  506A(b)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  and 
after  receiving  advice  from  the  Commission  in  accordance  with  section 
503(e)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined  to  designate  certain  articles 
as eligible articles when the articles are the growth, product, or manufacture 
of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country. 
15.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(1)), 
the  President  may  withdraw,  suspend,  or  limit  application  of  the  duty- 
free  treatment  accorded  to  specified  articles  under  the  GSP  when  imported 
from designated beneficiary developing countries. 
16.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  having  considered 
the  factors  set  forth  in  sections  501  and  502(c)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2462(c)),  I  have  determined  to  limit  the  application  of  duty-free  treatment 
accorded  to  certain  articles  from  certain  beneficiary  developing  countries. 
17.  Section  503(c)(2)(A)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2)(A))  provides 
that beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-devel-
oped  beneficiary  developing  countries  or  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African 
countries  as  provided  in  section  503(c)(2)(D)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(D)), are subject to competitive need limitations on the preferential 
treatment afforded under the GSP to eligible articles. 
18.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(2)(A)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined 
that in 2015 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles

in  quantities  exceeding  the  applicable  competitive  need  limitations,  and 
I  therefore  terminate  the  duty-free  treatment  for  such  articles  from  such 
beneficiary developing countries. 
19. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides 
that  the  President  may  disregard  the  competitive  need  limitation  provided 
in  section  503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) 
with  respect  to  any  eligible  article  from  any  beneficiary  developing  country 
if  the  aggregate  appraised  value  of  the  imports  of  such  article  into  the 
United States during the preceding calendar year does not exceed an amount 
set forth in section 503(c)(2)(F)(ii) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)). 
20.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(2)(F)(i)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined 
that  the  competitive  need  limitation  provided  in  section  503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) 
of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles 
from certain beneficiary developing countries. 
21.  Section  503(d)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(d)(1))  provides  that 
the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations 
in  section  503(c)(2)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2))  with  respect 
to  any  eligible  article  from  any  beneficiary  developing  country  if  certain 
conditions are met. 
22.  Pursuant  to  section  503(d)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  received  the 
advice  of  the  Commission  on  whether  any  industry  in  the  United  States 
is  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  by  waivers  of  the  competitive  need  limita-
tions  provided  in  section  503(c)(2)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  I  have  determined, 
based  on  that  advice  and  on  the  considerations  described  in  sections  501 
and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and after giving great weight to the considerations 
in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers 
are  in  the  national  economic  interest  of  the  United  States.  Accordingly, 
I  have  determined  that  the  competitive  need  limitations  of  section  503(c)(2) 
of  the  1974  Act  should  be  waived  with  respect  to  certain  eligible  articles 
from certain beneficiary developing countries. 
23.  Section  604  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2483)  authorizes  the  President 
to  embody  in  the  HTS  the  substance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that 
Act,  and  of  other  Acts  affecting  import  treatment,  and  actions  thereunder, 
including  removal,  modification,  continuance,  or  imposition  of  any  rate 
of duty or other import restriction. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  but  not  limited 
to  section  111(b)  of  the  URAA,  section  506B  of  the  1974  Act,  sections 
112(g), 112(b)(3)(A), and 112(c)(1) of the AGOA, section 104(c) of the TPEA, 
and title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: 

(1)  In  order  to  provide  for  the  immediate  or  staged  elimination  of  duties 
on  the  information  technology  products  covered  by  the  Declaration,  the 
HTS  is  modified  as  set  forth  in  Annexes  I  and  II  to  this  proclamation; 
(2) In order to provide that duty-free treatment provided under the AGOA 
shall  remain  in  effect  through  September  30,  2025,  general  note  16(c)  of 
the  HTS  is  modified  by  striking  ‘‘September  30,  2015’’  and  by  inserting 
in lieu thereof ‘‘September 30, 2025’’; 

(3)  In  order  to  provide  that  the  regional  apparel  article  program  and 
the  third-country  fabric  program  are  effective  through  September  30,  2025, 
chapter  98,  subchapter  XIX,  U.S.  note  2  of  the  HTS  is  modified  by  striking 
‘‘September  30,  2015’’  where  stated  in  ‘‘through  the  period  October  1,  2014 
through  September  30,  2015’’  and  in  ‘‘each  1-year  period  thereafter  through 
September 30, 2015’’ and by inserting in lieu thereof ‘‘September 30, 2025’’; 
(4)  In  order  to  provide  for  the  addition  of  the  special  tariff  treatment 
symbol  ‘‘D’’  in  the  ‘‘Special’’  subcolumn  where  necessary  in  the  HTS,  the 
HTS is modified as set forth in Annex III to this proclamation;

""Silicon based"" means built on a silicon substrate, or made of silicon materials, or 
manufactured onto integrated circuit die. 

3. 

(a} 

""Silicon based sensors"" consist of microelectronic and/or mechanical 
structures that are created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor 
and that have the function of detecting physical or chemical quantities and 
transducing these into electric signals, caused by resulting variations in 
electric properties or displacement of a mechanical structure. ""Physical or 
chemical quantities"" relates to real world phenomena, such as pressure, 
acoustic waves, acceleration, vibration, movement, orientation, strain, 
magnetic field strength, electric field strength, light, radioactivity, humidity, 
flow, chemicals concentration, etc. 

(b) 

(c) 

{d) 

""Silicon based actuators"" consist of microelectronic and mechanical structures 
that are created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and that 
have the function of converting electrical signals into physical movement 

""Silicon based resonators"" are components that consist of microelectronic 
and/or mechanical structures that are created in the mass or on the surface of 
a semiconductor and have the function of generating a mechanical or 
electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on the physical 
geometry of these structures in response to an external input. 

""Silicon based oscillators"" are active components that consist of 
microelectronic and/or mechanical structures that are created in the mass or 
on the surface of a semiconductor and that have the function of generating a 
mechanical or electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on 
the physical geometry of these structures.""

transducing these into electric signals, caused by resulting variations in 
electric properties or displacement of a mechanical structure. ""Physical or 
chemical quantities"" relates to real world phenomena, such as pressure, 
acoustic waves, acceleration, vibration, movement, orientation, strain, 
magnetic field strength, electric field strength, light, radioactivity, humidity, 
flow, chemicals concentration, etc. 

(b) 

(c) 

""Silicon based actuators"" consist of microelectronic and mechanical structures 
that are created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and that 
have the function of converting electrical signals into physical movement. 

""Silicon based resonators"" are components that consist of microelectronic 
and/or mechanical structures that are created in the mass or on the surface of 
a semiconductor and have the function of generating a mechanical or 
electrical oscillation of a predefined frequency that depends on the physical 
geometry of these structures in response to an external input.

32.  The following new additional U.S. note 5 is inserted in numerical sequence in chapter 90: 

""5.  For purposes of this chapter, the expression ""goods described in additional U.S. note 5 to this 
chapter"" are multi-component integrated circuits (MCOs), comprising a combination of one or 
more monolithic, hybrid, and/or multi-chip integrated circuits with at least one of the following 
components:  silicon-based sensors, actuators, oscillators, resonators or combinations thereof, 
or components performing the functions of articles classifiable under heading 8532, 8533, 
8541, or inductors classifiable under heading 8504, formed to all intents and purposes 
indivisibly into a single body like an integrated circuit, as a component of a kind used for 
assembly onto a printed circuit board (PCB) or other carrier, through the connecting of pins, 
leads, balls, lands, bumps, or pads. 

For the purpose of this definition : 

1. 

2. 

""Components"" may be discrete, manufactured independently then assembled onto 
the rest of the MCO, or integrated into other components. 

""Silicon based"" means built on a silicon substrate, or made of silicon materials, or 
manufactured onto integrated circuit die. 

3. 

(a) 

""Silicon based sensors"" consist of microelectronic and/or mechanical 
structures that are created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor 
and that have the function of detecting physical or chemical quantities and 
transducing these into electric signals, caused by resulting variations in 
electric properties or displacement of a mechanical structure. ""Physical or 
chemical quantities"" relates to real world phenomena, such as pressure, 
acoustic waves, acceleration, vibration, movement, orientation, strain, 
magnetic field strength, electric field strength, light, radioactivity, humidity, 
flow, chemicals concentration, etc. 

(b) 

""Silicon based actuators"" consist of microelectronic and mechanical structures 
that are created in the mass or on the surface of a semiconductor and that 
have the function of converting electrical signals into physical movement.

48313 

Notice  of  July  20,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Transnational  Criminal  Organizations 

On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, I declared a national emergency 
with  respect  to  significant  transnational  criminal  organizations  pursuant  to 
the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706) 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities 
of significant transnational criminal organizations. 
The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached 
such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international polit-
ical  and  economic  systems.  Such  organizations  are  becoming  increasingly 
sophisticated  and  dangerous  to  the  United  States;  they  are  increasingly  en-
trenched  in  the  operations  of  foreign  governments  and  the  international 
financial  system,  thereby  weakening  democratic  institutions,  degrading  the 
rule  of  law,  and  undermining  economic  markets.  These  organizations  facili-
tate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activi-
ties of other dangerous persons. 
The  activities  of  significant  transnational  criminal  organizations  continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national 
emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13581  of  July  24,  2011,  and  the 
measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue 
in effect beyond July 24, 2016. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for 
1 year the national emergency with respect to significant transnational crimi-
nal organizations declared in Executive Order 13581. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  November  8,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Proliferation  of  Weapons  of  Mass  Destruction 

On  November  14,  1994,  by  Executive  Order  12938,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States 
posed  by  the  proliferation  of  nuclear,  biological,  and  chemical  weapons 
(weapons  of  mass  destruction)  and  the  means  of  delivering  such  weapons. 
On  July  28,  1998,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13094,  amending 
Executive  Order  12938,  to  respond  more  effectively  to  the  worldwide  threat 
of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  proliferation  activities.  On  June  28,  2005, 
the President issued Executive Order 13382, which, inter alia, further amend-
ed  Executive  Order  12938,  to  improve  our  ability  to  combat  proliferation. 
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering 
them  continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national 
security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States;  therefore,  the 
national  emergency  first  declared  on  November  14,  1994,  and  extended 
in  each  subsequent  year,  must  continue.  In  accordance  with  section  202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  the 
national emergency declared in Executive Order 12938. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  May  12,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Yemen 

On May 16, 2012, by Executive Order 13611, I declared a national emergency 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions 
and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government  of  Yemen  and  others 
that threatened Yemen’s peace, security, and stability, including by obstruct-
ing  the  implementation  of  the  agreement  of  November  23,  2011,  between 
the  Government  of  Yemen  and  those  in  opposition  to  it,  which  provided 
for  a  peaceful  transition  of  power  that  meets  the  legitimate  demands  and 
aspirations of the Yemeni people for change, and by obstructing the political 
process in Yemen. 
The  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government  of  Yemen 
and  others  in  threatening  Yemen’s  peace,  security,  and  stability  continue 
to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and 
foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  May  16,  2012,  to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  May  16,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611.

assessment rebates were projections and 
subject to change. Therefore, credit 
unions should not have been relying on 
a possible refund for managing their 
financial condition.37 

A few commenters stated the 

When Stabilization Fund assessments 
were collected, they were accounted for 
as expenses to credit unions and income 
to the Stabilization Fund. As the 
performance of the Legacy Assets 
improved and the NCUA collected legal 
recoveries, the projected assessment 
range became negative for the first time 
in 2013, indicating projected assessment 
rebates and recoveries of depleted 
corporate capital. At no time did the 
NCUA guarantee that assessment rebates 
would be made.36 

Rather, the Board noted that the 

‘‘proposed method for closing the 
[Stabilization Fund] does nothing to 
address the excessive $1B charged since 
its creation to the [Asset Management 
Estates] by the NCUA.’’ It is unclear 
what expenses these commenters are 
referring to. The losses related to the 
corporate credit unions are described on 
the NCUA’s Web site. They include, 
among others, losses on investment 
securities (Legacy Assets), as well as 
costs of funding other pre-liquidation 
obligations the corporate credit unions 
had incurred. Every effort was made to 
keep the costs of resolving the failed 
corporate credit unions as low as 
possible.38 However, the resolution of 
the corporate credit unions was 
necessary and allowed the NCUA and 
credit union community to contain the 
financial and operational impact of the 
crisis. In addition, without being 
conserved and liquidated, the corporate 
credit unions (1) would have been 
unable to extend operations for the time 
required to realize uncertain legal 
recoveries; and (2) would have been 
unable to recover the material amounts 
the Board was able to recover without 
the benefit of the Act’s extender statute. 
Funds now available for distribution to 

36 The agency is under no legal obligation to 

distribute any funds to insured credit unions other 
than amounts above where the NCUA Board sets 
the normal operating level. In accordance with the 
Act, the Board can only set the normal operating 
level as high as 1.50 percent. 12 U.S.C. 1782(h)(4). 
37 Credit unions must be able to operate under a 
business model that provides for positive earnings 
and the accumulation of net worth irrespective of 
potential one-time increases in income. By their 
nature, one-time payouts such as a distribution 
from the Insurance Fund, are unpredictable and 
non-recurring. Therefore, credit unions must be 
able to operate in a safe and sound manner through 
normal, routine operations. 

38 NCUA has provided details of the liquidation 

expenses and costs associated with each asset 
management estate on its Web site. See NCUA’s Q4 
2016 Costs and Assessments Q&A (response to 
question 15) and the Stabilization Fund’s financial 
statements for additional information.

credit unions are due principally to 
legal recoveries that enabled the asset 
management estates to repay some of 
the losses the Stabilization Fund 
incurred. 

The Board appreciates commenters 

that considered how closing the 
Stabilization Fund might affect the 
NCUA’s contingency funding. The 
Board reminds stakeholders that Public 
Law 111–22, Helping Families Save 
Their Homes Act of 2009, increased the 
NCUA’s borrowing authority with the 
U.S. Treasury to $6 billion. This 
borrowing authority is shared by both 
the Stabilization Fund and the 
Insurance Fund. With closure of the 
Stabilization Fund, the Insurance Fund 
will retain the $6 billion borrowing 
authority. The Central Liquidity 
Facility’s contingency funding ability is 
not altered by closure of the 
Stabilization Fund. 

The Board will address comments on 

its separate proposal to amend the 
Insurance Fund distribution method in 
12 CFR 741.4 in a separate action. 
IV. Final Action 

After considering the comments 

received, the Board approves the 
following: 

1. Closing the Stabilization Fund in 

2017 and distributing its funds, 
property, and other assets and liabilities 
to the Insurance Fund on October 1, 
2017.39 

2. Setting the normal operating level 
of the Insurance Fund to 1.39 percent, 
effective September 28, 2017.40 

3. Adopting the policy for setting the 

normal operating level, as outlined 
below. 
Policy for Setting the Normal Operating 
Level 

Periodically, the NCUA will review 

the equity needs of the Insurance Fund 
and provide this analysis to 
stakeholders. Board action is only 
necessary when this review suggests 
that a change in the normal operating 
level is warranted. Any change to the 
normal operating level of more than 1 
basis point shall be made only after a 

39 As noted in the July 2017 Notice, the 

Stabilization Fund will be audited as of September 
30, 2017. The financial statements of the Insurance 
Fund will continue to be presented under standards 
promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards 
Advisory Board and audited each calendar year. 
The post-closure financial statements and note 
disclosures for the Insurance Fund will continue to 
provide the same level of detail about the 
receivables from the corporate asset management 
estates and related fiduciary activities. 

40 As explained in the July 2017 Notice, an equity 
ratio of 1.39 percent will allow the Insurance Fund 
to withstand a moderate recession without the 
equity ratio falling below 1.20 percent over a five- 
year period. 

public announcement of the proposed 
adjustment and opportunity for 
comment. In soliciting comment, the 
NCUA will issue a public report, 
including data supporting the proposal. 

When setting the normal operating 

level, the Board will seek to satisfy the 
following objectives: 
• Retain public confidence in federal 
• Prevent impairment of the one 
• Ensure the Insurance Fund can

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 

The purpose of this notice is to inform 

all licensees that NRC Form 3, ‘‘Notice 
to Employees,’’ has been revised. The 
NRC Form 3 describes certain 
responsibilities and rights of employers 
and employees who engage in NRC- 
regulated activities, including how 
employees can report violations or other 
safety concerns directly to the NRC. 
Section 19.11(e)(1) of title 10 of the 
Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR), 
states that licensees shall prominently 
post the most recent version of NRC 
Form 3, ‘‘Notice to Employees’’ within 
30 days of receiving the revised NRC 
Form 3 from the Commission. 

In a 1997 rulemaking, 10 CFR 19.11 

was amended to incorporate a reference 
to the latest version of NRC Form 3. 
This eliminated the need to revise the 
CFR whenever NRC Form 3 is changed, 
which had been the previous practice. 
The final rule published on September 
15, 1997 (62 FR 48165) indicated that 
the NRC would inform licensee of future 
changes to NRC Form 3 by an 
administrative letter and, in addition, 
the availability of any new versions 
would be noticed in the Federal 
Register. Administrative letters were a 
type of generic communication issued to 
inform addressees of specific regulatory 
or administrative information but were 
discontinued in September 1999. As 
such, in lieu of an administrative letter, 
this revision and future revisions will be 
publicized through an alternative 
electronic means (i.e. Web site notice, 
social networking service, etc.) to alert 
all licensees of the new revisions, as 
well as in the Federal Register. 

A new version of NRC Form 3 was 

issued in August 2017, to make a 
correction to the map of the NRC 
Regions and clarify operation of the 
Headquarters Operations Center. To 
view the current version of NRC Form 
3 (8/2017), please go to https://

II. Background 

Under the provisions of the 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 
U.S.C. Chapter 35), the NRC recently 
submitted a request for renewal of an 
existing collection of information to 

OMB for review titled, NRC Form 749, 
‘‘Manual License Verification Report.’’ 
The NRC hereby informs potential 
respondents that an agency may not 
conduct or sponsor, and that a person is 
not required to respond to, a collection 
of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. 

The NRC published a Federal 

Register notice with a 60-day comment 
period on this information collection on 
March 23, 2017 (82 FR 14919). 
1. The title of the information 

collection: NRC Form 749, ‘‘Manual 
License Verification Report.’’ 

2. OMB approval number: 3150–0223. 
3. Type of submission: Extension. 
4. The form number if applicable: 

NRC Form 749. 

5. How often the collection is required 

or requested: On occasion. Licensees 
subject to 10 CFR part 37, ‘‘Physical 
Protection of Byproduct Material’’ 
license verification requirements must 
verify the legitimacy of the license with 
the issuing agency prior to transferring 
radioactive materials in quantities of 
concern. 

6. Who will be required or asked to 

respond: Licensees are required to 
complete a license verification under 
the circumstances noted in 4 above. A 
License Verification System (LVS) is 
available to provide an electronic 
method for fulfilling this requirement. 
In cases where a licensee is unable to 
use the LVS to perform a verification, 
they will provide NRC Form 749 for 
manual license verification. 

7. The estimated number of annual 

responses: 456. 

8. The estimated number of annual 

respondents: 456. 

9. An estimate of the total number of 
hours needed annually to comply with 
the information collection requirement 
or request: 46 hours. 

10. Abstract: When a licensee is 

unable to use the License Verification 
System to perform their license 
verification prior to transferring 
radioactive materials in quantities of 
concern, a manual process is available, 
in which licensees submit the NRC 
Form 749, ‘‘Manual License Verification 
Report.’’ The form provides the 
information necessary for the license 
issuing agencies to perform the 
verification on behalf of the licensee 
transferring the radioactive materials. 
For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

NRC Clearance Officer, Office of the Chief 
Information Officer.

International Trade Administration 

[Order No. 2037] 

Approval of Expansion of Subzone 
87F; Westlake Chemical Corporation; 
Sulphur, Louisiana 

Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign- 

Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as 
amended (19 U.S.C. 81a–81u), the Foreign- 
Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the 
following Order: 

Whereas, the Foreign-Trade Zones 

(FTZ) Act provides for ‘‘. . . the 
establishment . . . of foreign-trade 
zones in ports of entry of the United 
States, to expedite and encourage 
foreign commerce, and for other 
purposes,’’ and authorizes the Foreign- 
Trade Zones Board to grant to qualified 
corporations the privilege of 
establishing foreign-trade zones in or 
adjacent to U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection ports of entry; 

Whereas, the Board’s regulations (15 

CFR part 400) provide for the 
establishment of subzones for specific 
uses; 

Whereas, the Lake Charles Harbor & 
Terminal District, grantee of Foreign- 
Trade Zone 87, has made application to 
the Board to expand Subzone 87F on 
behalf of Westlake Chemical 
Corporation to include two additional 
sites located in Westlake, Louisiana 
(FTZ Docket B–17–2017, docketed 
March 24, 2017); 

Whereas, notice inviting public 

comment has been given in the Federal 
Register (82 FR 15687–15688, March 30, 
2017) and the application has been 
processed pursuant to the FTZ Act and 
the Board’s regulations; and, 

Whereas, the Board adopts the 

findings and recommendations of the 
examiner’s memorandum, and finds that 
the requirements of the FTZ Act and the 
Board’s regulations are satisfied; 

Now, therefore, the Board hereby 

approves the expansion of Subzone 87F

Corporation as described in the 
application and Federal Register notice, 
subject to the FTZ Act and the Board’s 
regulations, including Section 400.13.

Request for Comment on the Costs

International Government Procurement 
Obligations for Report to the President 
on ‘‘Buy American and Hire American’’ 
AGENCY: International Trade

of the President. 
ACTION: Request for comments. 

SUMMARY: Section 3(e) of the 
Presidential Executive Order on Buy 
American and Hire American directs the 
Secretary of Commerce and the United 
States Trade Representative to assess the 
impacts of all United States free trade 
agreements and the World Trade 
Organization Agreement on Government 
Procurement (GPA) on the operation of 
Buy American Laws, including their 
impacts on the implementation of 
domestic procurement preferences. The 
Executive Order can be found here: 
https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press- 
office/2017/04/18/presidential- 
executive-order-buy-american-and-hire- 
american. 

In response to this Executive Order, 

the Department of Commerce 
(Department) and the Office of the 
United States Trade Representative 
(USTR) are conducting industry 
outreach in order to better understand 
how the U.S. government procurement 
obligations under all U.S. free trade 
agreements and the GPA affect U.S. 
manufacturers’ and suppliers’ access to 
and participation in the domestic 
government procurement process. In 
addition, because reciprocal access to 
trading partners’ markets is an 
important motivation for including

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Topics on which the Secretary of 

Commerce and the U.S. Trade 
Representative Seek Information: To 
assist the Department and USTR in 
conducting the assessment of how the 
U.S. government procurement 
obligations under all U.S. free trade 
agreements and the GPA affect U.S. 
manufacturers’ and suppliers’ access to 
and participation in the domestic and 
U.S. trading partners’ government 
procurement markets, commenters 
should submit information addressing 
any or all of the following questions. 
Please identify, where possible, the 

questions your comments are intended 
to address. 

Background: While EO 13788 is 

focused on the acquisition of goods, 
products, or materials in U.S. federal 
government procurement, the access 
provided by U.S. free trade agreements 
and the GPA in foreign markets to U.S. 
manufacturers and suppliers is based on 
reciprocity. Discussing the impact of 
these agreements on the access that U.S. 
goods have in foreign government 
procurement markets helps inform 
whether or not the access is truly 
reciprocal. 

In responding to the questions below, 
commenters should consider the impact 
for participating in U.S. federal and/or 
foreign government procurement 
markets with respect to: 

made available; 

• Business opportunities that are 
• Economic incentives that trade 
agreements and Buy American Laws 
provide; 

• How trade agreements impact 

business competitiveness, or increase or 
decrease competition, in government 
procurement opportunities; 

• How trade agreements affect 

companies’ (prime contractors’) supply 
chain and sourcing decisions for goods; 

• How Buy American or similar 

foreign requirements increase or 
decrease companies’ (prime 
contractors’) competitiveness in 
government procurement opportunities; 

• Administrative compliance costs 

tied to Buy American and similar 
government procurement policies; and 

• Additional costs relating to 

providing or otherwise proving the 
country of origin of goods provided. 
The questions below are focused on 
gathering information on the access to 
U.S. federal and/or foreign government 
procurement markets for goods that are 
manufactured in the United States, 
regardless of the nationality or location 
of the supplier. Additionally, this 
includes goods that are furnished to the 
U.S. federal and/or foreign government 
that may be a part of a contract for 
services, such as products that may be 
provided to the government as part of a 
contract for IT services, where Buy 
American Laws might otherwise apply. 

Respondents may organize their 

submissions in any manner, and all 
responses that comply with the 
requirements listed in the DATES and 
ADDRESSES sections of this notice will be 
considered. 

1. What is your company’s experience 

with respect to U.S. federal and/or 
foreign government procurement, either 
as prime contractor or a subcontractor? 
While any experience is welcome, 

please identify experiences within the 
past 5 years. 

a. Have you bid on U.S. federal 

contracts? How many? 

b. Were you awarded any U.S. federal 

contracts? How many? 

c. What share of annual revenue from 

your U.S. operations was from U.S. 
federal contracts? 

d. Have you bid on foreign 

government contracts? How many? List 
the countries of five largest bids. 

e. Were you awarded any foreign 

government contracts? How many? List 
the countries of five largest awards. 

f. What share of annual revenue from 

your U.S. operations was from foreign 
government contracts? 

g. List the industries in which your 
company was awarded U.S. federal or 
foreign government contracts. Indicate 
NAICS code(s) if possible. 

2. Please describe in a few sentences 

how your company’s decisions to bid on 
or supply U.S. federal contracts (as a 
prime or subcontractor or company that 
produces goods used in procurements) 
are affected by U.S. free trade 
agreements and the WTO GPA which 
allow equal participation by companies 
from U.S. trading partners. 

3. Please describe in few sentences 

your company’s experience as a prime 
or subcontractor in bidding on national 
government procurements in countries 
with which the U.S. has a trade 
agreement with government 
procurement obligations. What are your 
three greatest challenges? (These 
countries are: Armenia, Aruba, 
Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, 
Chinese Taipei (Taiwan), Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El 
Salvador, the European Union (which 
includes Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, 
Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, 
Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, 
Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, 
Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, 
Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the 
United Kingdom), Guatemala, 
Honduras, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Republic of 
Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, New 
Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, Oman, 
Panama, Peru, Singapore, Switzerland, 
and Ukraine.) How does this differ from 
your experience competing for bids in 
markets in countries with which the 
U.S. does not have a trade agreement 
with government procurement 
obligations? 

4. What is the average U.S. content of 
goods that your company supplies to the 
U.S. federal government?

7. Please describe in a few sentences 
how trade agreements with government 
procurement obligations affect strategic 
decisions your company makes about 
production and supply chains for 
government procurements as well as for 
commercial (private sector) customers. 
8. Please describe in a few sentences 
any experience your company has had 
with conflict between Buy American or 
similar foreign requirements and U.S. 
free trade agreement or WTO GPA 
requirements, including whether and 
how the conflict was resolved. 

9. Please describe in a few sentences 
whether the presence of Buy American 
or similar foreign requirements affected 
positively or negatively your company’s 
ability to bid and/or win contracts for 
U.S. or foreign government 
procurement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
Background 

On May 1, 2017, the Department of 
Commerce (the Department) initiated 
the antidumping duty investigations on 
certain tool chests and cabinets from the 
People’s Republic of China and the 
Socialist Republic of Vietnam.1 The 
Initiation Notice stated that the 
Department would issue its preliminary 
determinations for these investigations 
no later than 140 days after the date of 
the initiation in accordance with section 
733(b)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as 
amended (the Act), and 19 CFR 
351.205(b)(1), unless postponed.2 
Currently, the preliminary 
determinations of these investigations 
are due no later than September 18, 
2017. 
Period of Investigation 

The period of investigation is October 

1, 2016, through March 31, 2017. 
Postponements of Preliminary 
Determinations 

Section 733(c)(1)(A) of the Act 

permits the Department to postpone the 
time limit for the preliminary 
determination if it receives a timely 
request from the petitioner for 
postponement. The Department may 
postpone the preliminary determination 
under section 733(c)(1) of the Act to no 
later than 190 days after the date on 
which the administering authority 
initiates an investigation. 

On August 9, 2017, the petitioner, 

Waterloo Industries Inc., made a timely 
request under 19 CFR 351.205(e) for a 
50-day postponement of the preliminary 
determinations of these investigations.3 
The petitioner states that the 
postponements are necessary given the 
need for additional time to analyze 
responses from the selected respondents 
in these investigations.4 For the reasons 
stated above, and because there are no 
compelling reasons to deny the 
petitioner’s request, the Department is 
postponing the preliminary 
determinations of these investigations in 
accordance with section 733(c)(1)(A) of

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  is  in  the  national  interest  to  ensure  that  the  Nation’s 
navigable  waters  are  kept  free  from  pollution,  while  at  the  same  time  pro-

due regard for the roles of the Congress and the States under the Constitution. 
Sec. 2. Review of the Waters of the United States Rule. (a) The Administrator 
of  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (Administrator)  and  the  Assistant 
Secretary  of  the  Army  for  Civil  Works  (Assistant  Secretary)  shall  review 
the final rule entitled ‘‘Clean Water Rule: Definition of ‘Waters of the United 
States,’ ’’ 80 Fed. Reg. 37054 (June 29, 2015), for consistency with the policy 
set  forth  in  section  1  of  this  order  and  publish  for  notice  and  comment 
a proposed rule rescinding or revising the rule, as appropriate and consistent 
with law. 

(b) The Administrator, the Assistant Secretary, and the heads of all execu-
tive  departments  and  agencies  shall  review  all  orders,  rules,  regulations, 
guidelines,  or  policies  implementing  or  enforcing  the  final  rule  listed  in 
subsection  (a)  of  this  section  for  consistency  with  the  policy  set  forth  in 
section  1  of  this  order  and  shall  rescind  or  revise,  or  publish  for  notice 
and  comment  proposed  rules  rescinding  or  revising,  those  issuances,  as

of  a  rulemaking  proceeding  undertaken  pursuant  to  subsection  (a)  of  this 
section. 

(c)  With  respect  to  any  litigation  before  the  Federal  courts  related  to 
the  final  rule  listed  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section,  the  Administrator 
and  the  Assistant  Secretary  shall  promptly  notify  the  Attorney  General  of 
the pending review under subsection (b) of this section so that the Attorney 
General  may,  as  he  deems  appropriate,  inform  any  court  of  such  review 
and take such measures as he deems appropriate concerning any such litiga-
tion  pending  the  completion  of  further  administrative  proceedings  related 
to the rule. 
Sec. 3. Definition of ‘‘Navigable Waters’’ in Future Rulemaking. In connection 
with  the  proposed  rule  described  in  section  2(a)  of  this  order,  the  Adminis-
trator and the Assistant Secretary shall consider interpreting the term ‘‘navi-
gable  waters,’’  as  defined  in  33  U.S.C.  1362(7),  in  a  manner  consistent

547 U.S. 715 (2006). 
Sec.  4.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget

20815 

Executive  Order  13795  of  April  28,  2017 

Implementing  an  America-First  Offshore  Energy  Strategy 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Outer Continental Shelf 
Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq., and in order to maintain global leadership 
in  energy  innovation,  exploration,  and  production,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as 
follows: 
Section 1. Findings. America must put the energy needs of American families 
and  businesses  first  and  continue  implementing  a  plan  that  ensures  energy 
security and economic vitality for decades to come. The energy and minerals 
produced  from  lands  and  waters  under  Federal  management  are  important 
to a vibrant economy and to our national security. Increased domestic energy 
production  on  Federal  lands  and  waters  strengthens  the  Nation’s  security 
and  reduces  reliance  on  imported  energy.  Moreover,  low  energy  prices, 
driven  by  an  increased  American  energy  supply,  will  benefit  American 
families  and  help  reinvigorate  American  manufacturing  and  job  growth. 
Finally,  because  the  Department  of  Defense  is  one  of  the  largest  consumers 
of  energy  in  the  United  States,  domestic  energy  production  also  improves 
our Nation’s military readiness. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  It  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  encourage

within the designated area—including offshore energy from wind, oil, natural 
gas, methane hydrates, and any other sources that the Secretary of Commerce 
deems  appropriate—and  the  potential  impact  the  proposed  designation  or 
expansion  will  have  on  the  development  of  those  resources.  The  Secretary 
of the Interior shall provide any such accounting within 60 days of receiving 
a  notification  of  intent  to  propose  any  such  National  Marine  Sanctuary 
designation or expansion from the Secretary of Commerce. 

(b)  The  Secretary  of  Commerce,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of 
Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
shall conduct a review of all designations and expansions of National Marine 
Sanctuaries,  and  of  all  designations  and  expansions  of  Marine  National 
Monuments under the Antiquities Act of 1906, recently recodified at sections 
320301  to  320303  of  title  54,  United  States  Code,  designated  or  expanded 
within the 10-year period prior to the date of this order. 

(i) The review under this subsection shall include: 

(A)  an  analysis  of  the  acreage  affected  and  an  analysis  of  the  budgetary 
impacts  of  the  costs  of  managing  each  National  Marine  Sanctuary  or 
Marine National Monument designation or expansion; 

(B)  an  analysis  of  the  adequacy  of  any  required  Federal,  State,  and 
tribal  consultations  conducted  before  the  designations  or  expansions;  and 
(C)  the  opportunity  costs  associated  with  potential  energy  and  mineral 
exploration  and  production  from  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf,  in  addition 
to any impacts on production in the adjacent region. 
(ii)  Within  180  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce, 
in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  Defense  and  the  Secretary  of  the 
Interior,  shall  report  the  results  of  the  review  under  this  subsection  to 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  the  Chairman  of 
the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality,  and  the  Assistant  to  the  President 
for Economic Policy. 
(c)  To  further  streamline  existing  regulatory  authorities,  Executive  Order 
13754  of  December  9,  2016  (Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience),  is 
hereby revoked. 
Sec.  5.  Modification  of  the  Withdrawal  of  Areas  of  the  Outer  Continental 
Shelf  from  Leasing  Disposition.  The  body  text  in  each  of  the  memoranda 
of  withdrawal  from  disposition  by  leasing  of  the  United  States  Outer  Conti-
nental  Shelf  issued  on  December  20,  2016,  January  27,  2015,  and  July 
14, 2008, is modified to read, in its entirety, as follows: 

‘‘Under  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  of  the  United  States, 
including  section  12(a)  of  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  Lands  Act,  43  U.S.C. 
1341(a),  I  hereby  withdraw  from  disposition  by  leasing,  for  a  time  period 
without  specific  expiration,  those  areas  of  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  des-
ignated  as  of  July  14,  2008,  as  Marine  Sanctuaries  under  the  Marine  Protec-
tion, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972, 16 U.S.C. 1431–1434, 33 U.S.C. 
1401 et seq.’’ 

Nothing  in  the  withdrawal  under  this  section  affects  any  rights  under 

existing leases in the affected areas.

latory  Review.  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior  shall  direct  the  Director  of

and  Operators  of  Federal  Oil  and  Gas,  and  Sulfur  Leases,  and  Holders 
of Pipeline Right-of-Way and Right-of-Use and Easement Grants in the Outer

if  so,  to  what  extent,  to  ensure  operator  compliance  with  lease  terms  while 
minimizing  unnecessary  regulatory  burdens.  The  Secretary  of  the  Interior 
shall also review BOEM’s financial assurance regulatory policy to determine 
the extent to which additional regulation is necessary.

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13792  of  April  26,  2017 

Review  of  Designations  Under  the  Antiquities  Act 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  recognition  of  the  importance 
of  the  Nation’s  wealth  of  natural  resources  to  American  workers  and  the 
American economy, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Policy. Designations of national monuments under the Antiquities 
Act  of  1906,  recently  recodified  at  sections  320301  to  320303  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code  (the  ‘‘Antiquities  Act’’  or  ‘‘Act’’),  have  a  substantial 
impact  on  the  management  of  Federal  lands  and  the  use  and  enjoyment 
of neighboring lands. Such designations are a means of stewarding America’s 
natural resources, protecting America’s natural beauty, and preserving Amer-
ica’s historic places. Monument designations that result from a lack of public 
outreach  and  proper  coordination  with  State,  tribal,  and  local  officials  and 
other  relevant  stakeholders  may  also  create  barriers  to  achieving  energy 
independence,  restrict  public  access  to  and  use  of  Federal  lands,  burden 
State, tribal, and local governments, and otherwise curtail economic growth. 
Designations should be made in accordance with the requirements and origi-
nal  objectives  of  the  Act  and  appropriately  balance  the  protection  of  land-
marks,  structures,  and  objects  against  the  appropriate  use  of  Federal  lands 
and the effects on surrounding lands and communities. 
Sec.  2.  Review  of  National  Monument  Designations.  (a)  The  Secretary  of 
the Interior (Secretary) shall conduct a review of all Presidential designations 
or expansions of designations under the Antiquities Act made since January 
1,  1996,  where  the  designation  covers  more  than  100,000  acres,  where  the 
designation  after  expansion  covers  more  than  100,000  acres,  or  where  the 
Secretary  determines  that  the  designation  or  expansion  was  made  without 
adequate  public  outreach  and  coordination  with  relevant  stakeholders,  to 
determine  whether  each  designation  or  expansion  conforms  to  the  policy 
set  forth  in  section  1  of  this  order.  In  making  those  determinations,  the 
Secretary shall consider: 

(i)  the  requirements  and  original  objectives  of  the  Act,  including  the 
Act’s  requirement  that  reservations  of  land  not  exceed  ‘‘the  smallest  area 
compatible  with  the  proper  care  and  management  of  the  objects  to  be 
protected’’; 
(ii)  whether  designated  lands  are  appropriately  classified  under  the  Act 
as ‘‘historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, [or] other objects 
of historic or scientific interest’’; 
(iii) the effects of a designation on the available uses of designated Federal 
lands,  including  consideration  of  the  multiple-use  policy  of  section 
102(a)(7)  of  the  Federal  Land  Policy  and  Management  Act  (43  U.S.C. 
1701(a)(7)),  as  well  as  the  effects  on  the  available  uses  of  Federal  lands 
beyond the monument boundaries; 
(iv)  the  effects  of  a  designation  on  the  use  and  enjoyment  of  non-Federal 
lands within or beyond monument boundaries; 
(v)  concerns  of  State,  tribal,  and  local  governments  affected  by  a  designa-
tion, including the economic development and fiscal condition of affected 
States, tribes, and localities; 
(vi)  the  availability  of  Federal  resources  to  properly  manage  designated 
areas; and

(b)  In  conducting  the  review  described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section, 
the Secretary shall consult and coordinate with, as appropriate, the Secretary 
of  Defense,  the  Secretary  of  Agriculture,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  the 
Secretary  of  Energy,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  and  the  heads

ignated under the Act.

the Secretary shall, as appropriate, consult and coordinate with the Governors 
of  States  affected  by  monument  designations  or  other  relevant  officials  of 
affected State, tribal, and local governments. 

(d)  Within  45  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  shall  provide 
an  interim  report  to  the  President,  through  the  Director  of  the  Office  of 
Management and Budget, the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, 
the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Domestic  Policy,  and  the  Chairman  of 
the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality,  summarizing  the  findings  of  the 
review described in subsection (a) of this section with respect to Proclamation 
9558 of December 28, 2016 (Establishment of the Bears Ears National Monu-
ment), and such other designations as the Secretary determines to be appro-
priate for inclusion in the interim report. For those designations, the interim 
report  shall  include  recommendations  for  such  Presidential  actions,  legisla-
tive  proposals,  or  other  actions  consistent  with  law  as  the  Secretary  may 
consider  appropriate  to  carry  out  the  policy  set  forth  in  section  1  of  this 
order. 

(e)  Within  120  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  shall  provide 
a final report to the President, through the Director of the Office of Manage-
ment  and  Budget,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Economic  Policy,  the 
Assistant  to  the  President  for  Domestic  Policy,  and  the  Chairman  of  the 
Council  on  Environmental  Quality,  summarizing  the  findings  of  the  review 
described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section.  The  final  report  shall  include 
recommendations for such Presidential actions, legislative proposals, or other 
actions  consistent  with  law  as  the  Secretary  may  consider  appropriate  to 
carry out the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

28229 

Executive  Order  13801  of  June  15,  2017 

Expanding  Apprenticeships  in  America 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  to  promote  affordable  education 
and  rewarding  jobs  for  American  workers,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section 1. Purpose. America’s education systems and workforce development 
programs  are  in  need  of  reform.  In  today’s  rapidly  changing  economy,  it 
is  more  important  than  ever  to  prepare  workers  to  fill  both  existing  and 
newly  created  jobs  and  to  prepare  workers  for  the  jobs  of  the  future.  Higher 
education,  however,  is  becoming  increasingly  unaffordable.  Furthermore, 
many  colleges  and  universities  fail  to  help  students  graduate  with  the  skills 
necessary  to  secure  high-paying  jobs  in  today’s  workforce.  Far  too  many 
individuals  today  find  themselves  with  crushing  student  debt  and  no  direct 
connection to jobs. 
Against this background, federally funded education and workforce develop-
ment  programs  are  not  effectively  serving  American  workers.  Despite  the 
billions  of  taxpayer  dollars  invested  in  these  programs  each  year,  many 
Americans  are  struggling  to  find  full-time  work.  These  Federal  programs 
must  do  a  better  job  matching  unemployed  American  workers  with  open 
jobs, including the 350,000 manufacturing jobs currently available. 
Expanding  apprenticeships  and  reforming  ineffective  education  and  work-
force  development  programs  will  help  address  these  issues,  enabling  more 
Americans  to  obtain  relevant  skills  and  high-paying  jobs.  Apprenticeships 
provide  paid,  relevant  workplace  experiences  and  opportunities  to  develop 
skills  that  employers  value.  Additionally,  they  provide  affordable  paths  to 
good jobs and, ultimately, careers. 
Finally,  federally  funded  education  and  workforce  development  programs 
that  do  not  work  must  be  improved  or  eliminated  so  that  taxpayer  dollars 
can be channeled to more effective uses. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  It  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  Federal  Government  to  provide 
more  affordable  pathways  to  secure,  high-paying  jobs  by  promoting  appren-
ticeships  and  effective  workforce  development  programs,  while  easing  the 
regulatory  burden  on  such  programs  and  reducing  or  eliminating  taxpayer 
support for ineffective workforce development programs. 
Sec. 3. Definitions. For purposes of this order: 

(a) the term ‘‘apprenticeship’’ means an arrangement that includes a paid- 
work  component  and  an  educational  or  instructional  component,  wherein 
an individual obtains workplace-relevant knowledge and skills; and 

(b)  the  term  ‘‘job  training  programs’’  means  Federal  programs  designed 
to  promote  skills  development  or  workplace  readiness  and  increase  the 
earnings  or  employability  of  workers,  but  does  not  include  Federal  student 
aid or student loan programs. 
Sec.  4.  Establishing  Industry-Recognized  Apprenticeships.  (a)  The  Secretary 
of  Labor  (Secretary),  in  consultation  with  the  Secretaries  of  Education  and 
Commerce,  shall  consider  proposing  regulations,  consistent  with  applicable 
law, including 29 U.S.C. 50, that promote the development of apprenticeship 
programs by third parties. These third parties may include trade and industry 
groups, companies, non-profit organizations, unions, and joint labor-manage-
ment organizations. To the extent permitted by law and supported by sound

policy, any such proposed regulations shall reflect an assessment of whether 
to: 

(i) determine how qualified third parties may provide recognition to high- 
quality  apprenticeship  programs  (industry-recognized  apprenticeship  pro-
grams); 
(ii) establish guidelines or requirements that qualified third parties should 
or  must  follow  to  ensure  that  apprenticeship  programs  they  recognize 
meet quality standards; 
(iii)  provide  that  any  industry-recognized  apprenticeship  program  may 
be  considered  for  expedited  and  streamlined  registration  under  the  reg-
istered apprenticeship program the Department of Labor administers; 
(iv)  retain  the  existing  processes  for  registering  apprenticeship  programs 
for employers who continue using this system; and 
(v)  establish  review  processes,  consistent  with  applicable  law,  for  consid-
ering whether to: 

(A)  deny  the  expedited  and  streamlined  registration  under  the  Depart-
ment of Labor’s registered apprenticeship program, referred to in subsection 
(a)(iii) of this section, in any sector in which Department of Labor registered 
apprenticeship programs are already effective and substantially widespread; 
and 

(B)  terminate  the  registration  of  an  industry-recognized  apprenticeship 

program recognized by a qualified third party, as appropriate. 
(b)  The  Secretary  shall  consider  and  evaluate  public  comments  on  any 
regulations  proposed  under  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  before  issuing 
any final regulations. 
Sec.  5.  Funding  to  Promote  Apprenticeships.  Subject  to  available  appropria-
tions  and  consistent  with  applicable  law,  including  29  U.S.C.  3224a,  the 
Secretary  shall  use  available  funding  to  promote  apprenticeships,  focusing 
in  particular  on  expanding  access  to  and  participation  in  apprenticeships 
among students at accredited secondary and post-secondary educational insti-
tutions, including community colleges; expanding the number of apprentice-
ships in sectors that do not currently have sufficient apprenticeship opportu-
nities; and expanding youth participation in apprenticeships. 
Sec.  6.  Expanding  Access  to  Apprenticeships.  The  Secretaries  of  Defense, 
Labor,  and  Education,  and  the  Attorney  General,  shall,  in  consultation  with 
each  other  and  consistent  with  applicable  law,  promote  apprenticeships 
and  pre-apprenticeships  for  America’s  high  school  students  and  Job  Corps 
participants,  for  persons  currently  or  formerly  incarcerated,  for  persons  not 
currently  attending  high  school  or  an  accredited  post-secondary  educational 
institution,  and  for  members  of  America’s  armed  services  and  veterans. 
The  Secretaries  of  Commerce  and  Labor  shall  promote  apprenticeships  to 
business  leaders  across  critical  industry  sectors,  including  manufacturing, 
infrastructure, cybersecurity, and health care. 
Sec.  7.  Promoting  Apprenticeship  Programs  at  Colleges  and  Universities. 
The  Secretary  of  Education  shall,  consistent  with  applicable  law,  support 
the  efforts  of  community  colleges  and  2-year  and  4-year  institutions  of 
higher  education  to  incorporate  apprenticeship  programs  into  their  courses 
of study. 
Sec.  8.  Establishment  of  the  Task  Force  on  Apprenticeship  Expansion.  (a) 
The  Secretary  shall  establish  in  the  Department  of  Labor  a  Task  Force 
on Apprenticeship Expansion. 

(b)  The  mission  of  the  Task  Force  shall  be  to  identify  strategies  and 
proposals to promote apprenticeships, especially in sectors where apprentice-
ship programs are insufficient. The Task Force shall submit to the President 
a report on these strategies and proposals, including: 
(i) Federal initiatives to promote apprenticeships; 
(ii)  administrative  and  legislative  reforms  that  would  facilitate  the  forma-
tion and success of apprenticeship programs;

(iii)  the  most  effective  strategies  for  creating  industry-recognized  appren-
ticeships; and 
(iv)  the  most  effective  strategies  for  amplifying  and  encouraging  private- 
sector initiatives to promote apprenticeships. 
(c)  The  Department  of  Labor  shall  provide  administrative  support  and 
funding  for  the  Task  Force,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  subject

the  perspectives  of  American  companies,  trade  or  industry  groups,  edu-
cational  institutions,  and  labor  unions,  and  such  other  persons  as  the  Sec-
retary may from time to time designate. 

(e)  Insofar  as  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act,  as  amended  (5  U.S.C. 
App.),  may  apply  to  the  Task  Force,  any  functions  of  the  President  under 
that  Act,  except  for  those  of  reporting  to  the  Congress,  shall  be  performed

zations to implement apprenticeship programs. 
Sec.  10.  Improving  the  Effectiveness  of  Workforce  Development  Programs. 
(a)  Concurrent  with  its  budget  submission  to  the  Director  of  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  the  head  of  each  agency  shall  submit 
a  list  of  programs,  if  any,  administered  by  their  agency  that  are  designed

(b) The Director of OMB shall consider the information provided by agen-
cies  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  in  developing  the  President’s  Fiscal 
Year 2019 Budget.

feasible, these evaluations shall be conducted by third-party evaluators using 
the  most  rigorous  methods  appropriate  and  feasible  for  the  program,  with 
preference given to multi-site randomized controlled trials.

Memorandum  of  January  27,  2017 

Rebuilding  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Defense  [and]  the  Director  of  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States,  including  my  authority  as  Commander  in  Chief 
of  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States,  I  hereby  direct  the  following: 
Section  1.  Policy.  To  pursue  peace  through  strength,  it  shall  be  the  policy 
of the United States to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces. 
Sec.  2.  Readiness.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  Defense  (Secretary)  shall  conduct 
a  30-day  Readiness  Review.  As  part  of  this  review,  the  Secretary  shall: 
(i) assess readiness conditions, including training, equipment maintenance, 
munitions, modernization, and infrastructure; and 
(ii)  submit  to  the  President  a  report  identifying  actions  that  can  be  imple-
mented  within  the  current  fiscal  year  and  that  are  necessary  to  improve 
readiness conditions. 
(b)  Concurrently  with  the  Readiness  Review,  the  Secretary,  together  with 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  shall  develop 
a Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 budget amendment for military readiness, including 
any proposed reallocations. 

(c)  The  Secretary  shall  work  with  the  Director  of  OMB  to  develop  levels 
for  the  Department  of  Defense’s  FY  2018  budget  request  that  are  necessary

(d)  Within  60  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  shall  submit 
to the President a plan of action to achieve the levels of readiness identified 
in  the  Secretary’s  Readiness  Review  before  FY  2019.  That  plan  of  action 
shall  address  areas  for  improvement,  including  insufficient  maintenance, 
delays  in  acquiring  parts,  access  to  training  ranges,  combatant  command 
operational  demands,  funding  needed  for  consumables  (e.g.,  fuel,  ammuni-
tion),  manpower  shortfalls,  depot  maintenance  capacity,  and  time  needed 
to plan, coordinate, and execute readiness and training activities. 
Sec.  3.  Rebuilding  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces.  (a)  Upon  transmission  of  a  new 
National Security Strategy to Congress, the Secretary shall produce a National 
Defense  Strategy  (NDS).  The  goal  of  the  NDS  shall  be  to  give  the  President 
and  the  Secretary  maximum  strategic  flexibility  and  to  determine  the  force 
structure necessary to meet requirements. 

(b)  The  Secretary  shall  initiate  a  new  Nuclear  Posture  Review  to  ensure 
that the United States nuclear deterrent is modern, robust, flexible, resilient, 
ready,  and  appropriately  tailored  to  deter  21st-century  threats  and  reassure 
our allies. 

(c)  The  Secretary  shall  initiate  a  new  Ballistic  Missile  Defense  Review 
to  identify  ways  of  strengthening  missile-defense  capabilities,  rebalancing 
homeland  and  theater  defense  priorities,  and  highlighting  priority  funding 
areas. 
Sec.  4.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or

Memorandum  of  August  25,  2017 

Military  Service  by  Transgender  Individuals 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Defense  [and]  the  Secretary  of  Home-
land  Security 

the  Departments’  established 

Section  1.  Policy.  (a)  Until  June  2016,  the  Department  of  Defense  (DoD) 
and  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  (collectively,  the  Depart-
ments)  generally  prohibited  openly  transgender  individuals  from  accession 
into the United States military and authorized the discharge of such individ-
uals. Shortly before President Obama left office, however, his Administration 
dismantled 
framework  by  permitting 
transgender  individuals  to  serve  openly  in  the  military,  authorizing  the 
use  of  the  Departments’  resources  to  fund  sex-reassignment  surgical  proce-
dures,  and  permitting  accession  of  such  individuals  after  July  1,  2017.  The 
Secretary  of  Defense  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  have  since 
extended  the  deadline  to  alter  the  currently  effective  accession  policy  to 
January 1, 2018, while the Departments continue to study the issue. 
In  my  judgment,  the  previous  Administration  failed  to  identify  a  sufficient 
basis  to  conclude  that  terminating  the  Departments’  longstanding  policy 
and  practice  would  not  hinder  military  effectiveness  and  lethality,  disrupt 
unit  cohesion,  or  tax  military  resources,  and  there  remain  meaningful  con-
cerns  that  further  study  is  needed  to  ensure  that  continued  implementation 
of last year’s policy change would not have those negative effects. 

(b)  Accordingly,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  and  as  Com-
mander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States under the Constitu-
tion  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  Article  II 
of the Constitution, I am directing the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  with  respect  to  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  to  return  to 
the  longstanding  policy  and  practice  on  military  service  by  transgender 
individuals  that  was  in  place  prior  to  June  2016  until  such  time  as  a 
sufficient  basis  exists  upon  which  to  conclude  that  terminating  that  policy 
and  practice  would  not  have  the  negative  effects  discussed  above.  The 
Secretary  of  Defense,  after  consulting  with  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Secu-
rity,  may  advise  me  at  any  time,  in  writing,  that  a  change  to  this  policy 
is warranted.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

1139 

Proclamation  9558  of  December  28,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Bears  Ears  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Rising  from  the  center  of  the  southeastern  Utah  landscape  and  visible  from 
every  direction  are  twin  buttes  so  distinctive  that  in  each  of  the  native 
languages  of  the  region  their  name  is  the  same:  Hoon’Naqvut,  Shash  Ja´a, 
Kwiyagatu Nukavachi, Ansh An Lashokdiwe, or ‘‘Bears Ears.’’ For hundreds 
of  generations,  native  peoples  lived  in  the  surrounding  deep  sandstone  can-
yons,  desert  mesas,  and  meadow  mountaintops,  which  constitute  one  of 
the  densest  and  most  significant  cultural  landscapes  in  the  United  States. 
Abundant  rock  art,  ancient  cliff  dwellings,  ceremonial  sites,  and  countless 
other  artifacts  provide  an  extraordinary  archaeological  and  cultural  record 
that  is  important  to  us  all,  but  most  notably  the  land  is  profoundly  sacred 
to  many  Native  American  tribes,  including  the  Ute  Mountain  Ute  Tribe, 
Navajo  Nation,  Ute  Indian  Tribe  of  the  Uintah  Ouray,  Hopi  Nation,  and 
Zuni Tribe. 
The area’s human history is as vibrant and diverse as the ruggedly beautiful 
landscape.  From  the  earliest  occupation,  native  peoples  left  traces  of  their 
presence.  Clovis  people  hunted  among  the  cliffs  and  canyons  of  Cedar 
Mesa as early as 13,000 years ago, leaving behind tools and projectile points 
in  places  like  the  Lime  Ridge  Clovis  Site,  one  of  the  oldest  known  archae-
ological  sites  in  Utah.  Archaeologists  believe  that  these  early  people  hunted 
mammoths,  ground  sloths,  and  other  now-extinct  megafauna,  a  narrative 
echoed  by  native  creation  stories.  Hunters  and  gatherers  continued  to  live 
in  this  region  in  the  Archaic  Period,  with  sites  dating  as  far  back  as  8,500 
years ago. 
Ancestral  Puebloans  followed,  beginning  to  occupy  the  area  at  least  2,500 
years ago, leaving behind items from their daily life such as baskets, pottery, 
and  weapons.  These  early  farmers  of  Basketmaker  II  and  III  and  builders 
of  Pueblo  I,  II,  and  III  left  their  marks  on  the  land.  The  remains  of  single 
family dwellings, granaries, kivas, towers, and large villages and roads linking 
them  together  reveal  a  complex  cultural  history.  ‘‘Moki  steps,’’  hand  and 
toe  holds  carved  into  steep  canyon  walls  by  the  Ancestral  Puebloans,  illus-
trate  the  early  people’s  ingenuity  and  perseverance  and  are  still  used  today 
to  access  dwellings  along  cliff  walls.  Other,  distinct  cultures  have  thrived 
here as well—the Fremont People, Numic- and Athabaskan-speaking hunter- 
gatherers,  and  Utes  and  Navajos.  Resources  such  as  the  Doll  House  Ruin 
in  Dark  Canyon  Wilderness  Area  and  the  Moon  House  Ruin  on  Cedar  Mesa 
allow  visitors  to  marvel  at  artistry  and  architecture  that  have  withstood 
thousands of seasons in this harsh climate. 
The  landscape  is  a  milieu  of  the  accessible  and  observable  together  with 
the inaccessible and hidden. The area’s petroglyphs and pictographs capture 
the  imagination  with  images  dating  back  at  least  5,000  years  and  spanning 
a  range  of  styles  and  traditions.  From  life-size  ghostlike  figures  that  defy 
categorization,  to  the  more  literal  depictions  of  bighorn  sheep,  birds,  and 
lizards,  these  drawings  enable  us  to  feel  the  humanity  of  these  ancient 
artists.  The  Indian  Creek  area  contains  spectacular  rock  art,  including  hun-
dreds  of  petroglyphs  at  Newspaper  Rock.  Visitors  to  Bears  Ears  can  also 
discover  more  recent  rock  art  left  by  the  Ute,  Navajo,  and  Paiute  peoples.

It  is  also  the  less  visible  sites,  however—those  that  supported  the  food 
gathering,  subsistence  and  ceremony  of  daily  life—that  tell  the  story  of 
the  people  who  lived  here.  Historic  remnants  of  Native  American  sheep- 
herding  and  farming  are  scattered  throughout  the  area,  and  pottery  and 
Navajo  hogans  record  the  lifeways  of  native  peoples  in  the  19th  and  20th 
centuries. 
For  thousands  of  years,  humans  have  occupied  and  stewarded  this  land. 
With  respect  to  most  of  these  people,  their  contribution  to  the  historical 
record is unknown, but some have played a more public role. Famed Navajo 
headman  K’aaye´lii  was  born  around  1800  near  the  twin  Bears  Ears  buttes. 
His  band  used  the  area’s  remote  canyons  to  elude  capture  by  the  U.S. 
Army  and  avoid  the  fate  that  befell  many  other  Navajo  bands:  surrender, 
the Long Walk, and forced relocation to Bosque Redondo. Another renowned 
19th  century  Navajo  leader,  ‘‘Hastiin  Ch’ihaajin’’  Manuelito,  was  also  born 
near the Bears Ears. 
The  area’s  cultural  importance  to  Native  American  tribes  continues  to  this 
day.  As  they  have  for  generations,  these  tribes  and  their  members  come 
here  for  ceremonies  and  to  visit  sacred  sites.  Throughout  the  region,  many 
landscape  features,  such  as  Comb  Ridge,  the  San  Juan  River,  and  Cedar 
Mesa,  are  closely  tied  to  native  stories  of  creation,  danger,  protection,  and 
healing.  The  towering  spires  in  the  Valley  of  the  Gods  are  sacred  to  the 
Navajo,  representing  ancient  Navajo  warriors  frozen  in  stone.  Traditions 
of  hunting,  fishing,  gathering,  and  wood  cutting  are  still  practiced  by  tribal 
members,  as  is  collection  of  medicinal  and  ceremonial  plants,  edible  herbs, 
and  materials  for  crafting  items  like  baskets  and  footwear.  The  traditional 
ecological  knowledge  amassed  by  the  Native  Americans  whose  ancestors 
inhabited  this  region,  passed  down  from  generation  to  generation,  offers 
critical  insight  into  the  historic  and  scientific  significance  of  the  area.  Such 
knowledge  is,  itself,  a  resource  to  be  protected  and  used  in  understanding 
and managing this landscape sustainably for generations to come. 
Euro-Americans  first  explored  the  Bears  Ears  area  during  the  18th  century, 
and Mormon settlers followed in the late 19th century. The San Juan Mission 
expedition traversed this rugged country in 1880 on their journey to establish 
a new settlement in what is now Bluff, Utah. To ease the passage of wagons 
over the slick rock slopes and through the canyonlands, the settlers smoothed 
sections  of  the  rock  surface  and  constructed  dugways  and  other  features 
still  visible  along  their  route,  known  as  the  Hole-in-the-Rock  Trail.  Cabins, 
corrals, trails, and carved inscriptions in the rock reveal the lives of ranchers, 
prospectors,  and  early  archaeologists.  Cattle  rustlers  and  other  outlaws  cre-
ated  a  convoluted  trail  network  known  as  the  Outlaw  Trail,  said  to  be 
used by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. These outlaws took advantage 
of the area’s network of canyons, including the aptly-named Hideout Canyon, 
to avoid detection. 
The  area’s  stunning  geology,  from  sharp  pinnacles  to  broad  mesas,  labyrin-
thine  canyons  to  solitary  hoodoos,  and  verdant  hanging  gardens  to  bare 
stone  arches  and  natural  bridges,  provides  vital  insights  to  geologists.  In 
the east, the Abajo Mountains tower, reaching elevations of more than 11,000 
feet.  A  long  geologic  history  is  documented  in  the  colorful  rock  layers 
visible in the area’s canyons. 
For  long  periods  over  300  million  years  ago,  these  lands  were  inundated 
by  tropical  seas  and  hosted  thriving  coral  reefs.  These  seas  infused  the 
area’s  black  rock  shale  with  salts  as  they  receded.  Later,  the  lands  were 
bucked  upwards  multiple  times  by  the  Monument  Upwarp,  and  near-volca-
noes  punched  up  through  the  rock,  leaving  their  marks  on  the  landscape 
without reaching the surface. In the sandstone of Cedar Mesa, fossil evidence 
has  revealed  large,  mammal-like  reptiles  that  burrowed  into  the  sand  to 
survive  the  blistering  heat  of  the  end  of  the  Permian  Period,  when  the 
region  was  dominated  by  a  seaside  desert.  Later,  in  the  Late  Triassic  Period 
more  than  200  million  years  ago,  seasonal  monsoons  flooded  an  ancient 
river system that fed a vast desert here.

The  paleontological  resources  in  the  Bears  Ears  area  are  among  the  richest 
and  most  significant  in  the  United  States,  and  protection  of  this  area  will 
provide  important  opportunities  for  further  archaeological  and  paleontolog-
ical  study.  Many  sites,  such  as  Arch  Canyon,  are  teeming  with  fossils, 
and  research  conducted  in  the  Bears  Ears  area  is  revealing  new  insights 
into  the  transition  of  vertebrate  life  from  reptiles  to  mammals  and  from 
sea  to  land.  Numerous  ray-finned  fish  fossils  from  the  Permian  Period  have 
been  discovered,  along  with  other  late  Paleozoic  Era  fossils,  including  giant 
amphibians,  synapsid  reptiles,  and  important  plant  fossils.  Fossilized  traces 
of  marine  and  aquatic  creatures  such  as  clams,  crayfish,  fish,  and  aquatic 
reptiles  have  been  found  in  Indian  Creek’s  Chinle  Formation,  dating  to 
the Triassic Period, and phytosaur and dinosaur fossils from the same period 
have  been  found  along  Comb  Ridge.  Paleontologists  have  identified  new 
species  of  plant-eating  crocodile-like  reptiles  and  mass  graves  of  lumbering 
sauropods,  along  with  metoposaurus,  crocodiles,  and  other  dinosaur  fossils. 
Fossilized  trackways  of  early  tetrapods  can  be  seen  in  the  Valley  of  the 
Gods and in Indian Creek, where paleontologists have also discovered excep-
tional examples of fossilized ferns, horsetails, and cycads. The Chinle Forma-
tion  and  the  Wingate,  Kayenta,  and  Navajo  Formations  above  it  provide 
one  of  the  best  continuous  rock  records  of  the  Triassic-Jurassic  transition 
in  the  world,  crucial  to  understanding  how  dinosaurs  dominated  terrestrial 
ecosystems and how our mammalian ancestors evolved. In Pleistocene Epoch 
sediments,  scientists  have  found  traces  of  mammoths,  short-faced  bears, 
ground sloths, primates, and camels. 
From  earth  to  sky,  the  region  is  unsurpassed  in  wonders.  The  star-filled 
nights  and  natural  quiet  of  the  Bears  Ears  area  transport  visitors  to  an 
earlier  eon.  Against  an  absolutely  black  night  sky,  our  galaxy  and  others 
more  distant  leap  into  view.  As  one  of  the  most  intact  and  least  roaded 
areas  in  the  contiguous  United  States,  Bears  Ears  has  that  rare  and  arresting 
quality of deafening silence. 
Communities  have  depended  on  the  resources  of  the  region  for  hundreds 
of  generations.  Understanding  the  important  role  of  the  green  highlands 
in providing habitat for subsistence plants and animals, as well as capturing 
and  filtering  water  from  passing  storms,  the  Navajo  refer  to  such  places 
as  ‘‘Nahodishgish,’’  or  places  to  be  left  alone.  Local  communities  seeking 
to  protect  the  mountains  for  their  watershed  values  have  long  recognized 
the  importance  of  the  Bears  Ears’  headwaters.  Wildfires,  both  natural  and 
human-set,  have  shaped  and  maintained  forests  and  grasslands  of  this  area 
for  millennia.  Ranchers  have  relied  on  the  forests  and  grasslands  of  the 
region  for  ages,  and  hunters  come  from  across  the  globe  for  a  chance  at 
a  bull  elk  or  other  big  game.  Today,  ecological  restoration  through  the 
careful  use  of  wildfire  and  management  of  grazing  and  timber  is  working 
to  restore  and  maintain  the  health  of  these  vital  watersheds  and  grasslands. 
The  diversity  of  the  soils  and  microenvironments  in  the  Bears  Ears  area 
provide  habitat  for  a  wide  variety  of  vegetation.  The  highest  elevations, 
in  the  Elk  Ridge  area  of  the  Manti-La  Sal  National  Forest,  contain  pockets 
of  ancient  Engelmann  spruce,  ponderosa  pine,  aspen,  and  subalpine  fir. 
Mesa  tops  include  pinyon-juniper  woodlands  along  with  big  sagebrush,  low 
sage,  blackbrush,  rabbitbrush,  bitterbrush,  four-wing  saltbush,  shadscale, 
winterfat,  Utah  serviceberry,  western  chokecherry,  hackberry,  barberry,  cliff 
rose, and greasewood. Canyons contain diverse vegetation ranging from yucca 
and cacti such as prickly pear, claret cup, and Whipple’s fishhook to moun-
tain  mahogany,  ponderosa  pine,  alder,  sagebrush,  birch,  dogwood,  and 
Gambel’s oak, along with occasional stands of aspen. Grasses and herbaceous 
species  such  as  bluegrass,  bluestem,  giant  ryegrass,  ricegrass,  needle  and 
thread,  yarrow,  common  mallow,  balsamroot,  low  larkspur,  horsetail,  and 
peppergrass  also  grow  here,  as  well  as  pinnate  spring  parsley,  Navajo 
penstemon, Canyonlands lomatium, and the Abajo daisy. 
Tucked into winding canyons are vibrant riparian communities characterized 
by  Fremont  cottonwood,  western  sandbar  willow,  yellow  willow,  and  box

elder. Numerous seeps provide year-round water and support delicate hang-
ing  gardens,  moisture-loving  plants,  and  relict  species  such  as  Douglas  fir. 
A  few  populations  of  the  rare  Kachina  daisy,  endemic  to  the  Colorado 
Plateau, hide in shaded seeps and alcoves of the area’s canyons. A genetically 
distinct  population  of  Kachina  daisy  was  also  found  on  Elk  Ridge.  The 
alcove columbine and cave primrose, also regionally endemic, grow in seeps 
and  hanging  gardens  in  the  Bears  Ears  landscape.  Wildflowers  such  as 
beardtongue,  evening  primrose,  aster,  Indian  paintbrush,  yellow  and  purple 
beeflower,  straight  bladderpod,  Durango  tumble  mustard,  scarlet  gilia,  globe 
mallow,  sand  verbena,  sego  lily,  cliffrose,  sacred  datura,  monkey  flower, 
sunflower,  prince’s  plume,  hedgehog  cactus,  and  columbine,  bring  bursts 
of color to the landscape. 
The  diverse  vegetation  and  topography  of  the  Bears  Ears  area,  in  turn, 
support  a  variety  of  wildlife  species.  Mule  deer  and  elk  range  on  the  mesas 
and  near  canyon  heads,  which  provide  crucial  habitat  for  both  species. 
The  Cedar  Mesa  landscape  is  home  to  bighorn  sheep  which  were  once 
abundant  but  still  live  in  Indian  Creek,  and  in  the  canyons  north  of  the 
San  Juan  River.  Small  mammals  such  as  desert  cottontail,  black-tailed  jack-
rabbit,  prairie  dog,  Botta’s  pocket  gopher,  white-tailed  antelope  squirrel, 
Colorado  chipmunk,  canyon  mouse,  deer  mouse,  pinyon  mouse,  and  desert 
woodrat,  as  well  as  Utah’s  only  population  of  Abert’s  tassel-eared  squirrels, 
find  shelter  and  sustenance  in  the  landscape’s  canyons  and  uplands.  Rare 
shrews,  including  a  variant  of  Merriam’s  shrew  and  the  dwarf  shrew  can 
be found in this area. 
Carnivores, including badger, coyote, striped skunk, ringtail, gray fox, bobcat, 
and  the  occasional  mountain  lion,  all  hunt  here,  while  porcupines  use 
their  sharp  quills  and  climbing  abilities  to  escape  these  predators.  Oral 
histories  from  the  Ute  describe  the  historic  presence  of  bison,  antelope, 
and  abundant  bighorn  sheep,  which  are  also  depicted  in  ancient  rock  art. 
Black bear pass through the area but are rarely seen, though they are common 
in  the  oral  histories  and  legends  of  this  region,  including  those  of  the 
Navajo. 
Consistent sources of water in a dry landscape draw diverse wildlife species 
to  the  area’s  riparian  habitats,  including  an  array  of  amphibian  species 
such  as  tiger  salamander,  red-spotted  toad,  Woodhouse’s  toad,  canyon  tree 
frog, Great Basin spadefoot, and northern leopard frog. Even the most sharp- 
eyed  visitors  probably  will  not  catch  a  glimpse  of  the  secretive  Utah  night 
lizard.  Other  reptiles  in  the  area  include  the  sagebrush  lizard,  eastern  fence 
lizard,  tree  lizard,  side-blotched  lizard,  plateau  striped  whiptail,  western 
rattlesnake, night snake, striped whipsnake, and gopher snake. 
Raptors  such  as  the  golden  eagle,  peregrine  falcon,  bald  eagle,  northern 
harrier,  northern  goshawk,  red-tailed  hawk,  ferruginous  hawk,  American 
kestrel,  flammulated  owl,  and  great  horned  owl  hunt  their  prey  on  the 
mesa  tops  with  deadly  speed  and  accuracy.  The  largest  contiguous  critical 
habitat  for  the  threatened  Mexican  spotted  owl  is  on  the  Manti-La  Sal 
National  Forest.  Other  bird  species  found  in  the  area  include  Merriam’s 
turkey,  Williamson’s  sapsucker,  common  nighthawk,  white-throated  swift, 
ash-throated  flycatcher,  violet-green  swallow,  cliff  swallow,  mourning  dove, 
pinyon  jay,  sagebrush  sparrow,  canyon  towhee,  rock  wren,  sage  thrasher, 
and the endangered southwestern willow flycatcher. 
As  the  skies  darken  in  the  evenings,  visitors  may  catch  a  glimpse  of  some 
the  area’s  at  least  15  species  of  bats,  including  the  big  free-tailed  bat,  pallid 
bat,  Townsend’s  big-eared  bat,  spotted  bat,  and  silver-haired  bat.  Tinajas, 
rock  depressions  filled  with  rainwater,  provide  habitat  for  many  specialized 
aquatic  species,  including  pothole  beetles  and  freshwater  shrimp.  Eucosma 
navajoensis,  an  endemic  moth  that  has  only  been  described  near  Valley 
of the Gods, is unique to this area. 
Protection  of  the  Bears  Ears  area  will  preserve  its  cultural,  prehistoric,  and 
historic  legacy  and  maintain  its  diverse  array  of  natural  and  scientific  re-
sources,  ensuring  that  the  prehistoric,  historic,  and  scientific  values  of  this

area  remain  for  the  benefit  of  all  Americans.  The  Bears  Ears  area  has  been 
proposed  for  protection  by  members  of  Congress,  Secretaries  of  the  Interior, 
State  and  tribal  leaders,  and  local  conservationists  for  at  least  80  years. 
The  area  contains  numerous  objects  of  historic  and  of  scientific  interest, 
and it provides world class outdoor recreation opportunities, including rock 
climbing,  hunting,  hiking,  backpacking,  canyoneering,  whitewater  rafting, 
mountain  biking,  and  horseback  riding.  Because  visitors  travel  from  near 
and  far,  these  lands  support  a  growing  travel  and  tourism  sector  that  is 
a source of economic opportunity for the region. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  objects  of  scientific 
and historic interest on the Bears Ears lands; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Bears  Ears  National  Monument  (monument) 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  part  thereof 
all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map,  which 
is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal 
lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately  1.35  million  acres. 
The  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map  are  confined  to  the 
smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects 
to be protected. 
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monu-
ment  are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from  all  forms  of  entry,  loca-
tion,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the  public  land  laws  or 
laws  applicable  to  the  U.S.  Forest  Service,  from  location,  entry,  and  patent 
under  the  mining  laws,  and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to 
mineral  and  geothermal  leasing,  other  than  by  exchange  that  furthers  the 
protective purposes of the monument. 
The establishment of the monument is subject to valid existing rights, includ-
ing valid existing water rights. If the Federal Government acquires ownership 
or  control  of  any  lands  or  interests  in  lands  that  it  did  not  previously 
own  or  control  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map, 
such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved as a part of the monument, 
and objects identified above that are situated upon those lands and interests 
in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument,  upon  acquisition  of  ownership 
or control by the Federal Government. 
The  Secretary  of  Agriculture  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  (Secretaries) 
shall  manage  the  monument  through  the  U.S.  Forest  Service  (USFS)  and 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), pursuant to their respective applica-
ble  legal  authorities,  to  implement  the  purposes  of  this  proclamation.  The 
USFS  shall  manage  that  portion  of  the  monument  within  the  boundaries 
of the National Forest System (NFS), and the BLM shall manage the remainder 
of  the  monument.  The  lands  administered  by  the  USFS  shall  be  managed 
as  part  of  the  Manti-La  Sal  National  Forest.  The  lands  administered  by 
the BLM shall be managed as a unit of the National Landscape Conservation 
System, pursuant to applicable legal authorities. 
For  purposes  of  protecting  and  restoring  the  objects  identified  above,  the 
Secretaries  shall  jointly  prepare  a  management  plan  for  the  monument  and

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  3 / Thursday,  January  5,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

shall  promulgate  such  regulations  for  its  management  as  they  deem  appro-
priate.  The  Secretaries,  through  the  USFS  and  the  BLM,  shall  consult  with 
other  Federal  land  management  agencies  in  the  local  area,  including  the 
National Park Service, in developing the management plan. In promulgating 
any  management  rules  and  regulations  governing  the  NFS  lands  within 
the  monument  and  developing  the  management  plan,  the  Secretary  of  Agri-
culture,  through  the  USFS,  shall  consult  with  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior 
through the BLM. The Secretaries shall provide for maximum public involve-
ment in the development of that plan including, but not limited to, consulta-
tion  with  federally  recognized  tribes  and  State  and  local  governments.  In 
the development and implementation of the management plan, the Secretaries 
shall  maximize  opportunities,  pursuant  to  applicable  legal  authorities,  for 
shared resources, operational efficiency, and cooperation. 
The  Secretaries,  through  the  BLM  and  USFS,  shall  establish  an  advisory 
committee  under  the  Federal  Advisory  Committee  Act  (5  U.S.C.  App.)  to 
provide  information  and  advice  regarding  the  development  of  the  manage-
ment plan and, as appropriate, management of the monument. This advisory 
committee  shall  consist  of  a  fair  and  balanced  representation  of  interested 
stakeholders,  including  State  and  local  governments,  tribes,  recreational 
users, local business owners, and private landowners. 
In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  tribal  participation  to  the  care  and 
management of the objects identified above, and to ensure that management 
decisions  affecting  the  monument  reflect  tribal  expertise  and  traditional 
and  historical  knowledge,  a  Bears  Ears  Commission  (Commission)  is  hereby 
established  to  provide  guidance  and  recommendations  on  the  development 
and implementation of management plans and on management of the monu-
ment.  The  Commission  shall  consist  of  one  elected  officer  each  from  the 
Hopi  Nation,  Navajo  Nation,  Ute  Mountain  Ute  Tribe,  Ute  Indian  Tribe 
of  the  Uintah  Ouray,  and  Zuni  Tribe,  designated  by  the  officers’  respective 
tribes.  The  Commission  may  adopt  such  procedures  as  it  deems  necessary 
to  govern  its  activities,  so  that  it  may  effectively  partner  with  the  Federal 
agencies  by  making  continuing  contributions  to  inform  decisions  regarding 
the management of the monument. 
The  Secretaries  shall  meaningfully  engage  the  Commission  or,  should  the 
Commission  no  longer  exist,  the  tribal  governments  through  some  other 
entity  composed  of  elected  tribal  government  officers  (comparable  entity), 
in  the  development  of  the  management  plan  and  to  inform  subsequent 
management  of  the  monument.  To  that  end,  in  developing  or  revising  the 
management  plan,  the  Secretaries  shall  carefully  and  fully  consider  inte-
grating  the  traditional  and  historical  knowledge  and  special  expertise  of 
the Commission or comparable entity. If the Secretaries decide not to incor-
porate  specific  recommendations  submitted  to  them  in  writing  by  the  Com-
mission  or  comparable  entity,  they  will  provide  the  Commission  or  com-
parable entity with a written explanation of their reasoning. The management 
plan  shall  also  set  forth  parameters  for  continued  meaningful  engagement 
with the Commission or comparable entity in implementation of the manage-
ment plan. 
To  further  the  protective  purposes  of  the  monument,  the  Secretary  of  the 
Interior  shall  explore  entering  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  with 
the State that would set forth terms, pursuant to applicable laws and regula-
tions,  for  an  exchange  of  land  currently  owned  by  the  State  of  Utah  and 
administered  by  the  Utah  School  and  Institutional  Trust  Lands  Administra-
tion  within  the  boundary  of  the  monument  for  land  of  approximately  equal 
value  managed  by  the  BLM  outside  the  boundary  of  the  monument.  The 
Secretary  of  the  Interior  shall  report  to  the  President  by  January  19,  2017, 
regarding the potential for such an exchange. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  construed  to  interfere  with  the  oper-
ation or maintenance, or the replacement or modification within the current 
authorization  boundary,  of  existing  utility,  pipeline,  or  telecommunications

facilities  located  within  the  monument  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the 
care and management of the objects identified above. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  enlarge  or  diminish  the 
rights  or  jurisdiction  of  any  Indian  tribe.  The  Secretaries  shall,  to  the  max-
imum extent permitted by law and in consultation with Indian tribes, ensure 
the  protection  of  Indian  sacred  sites  and  traditional  cultural  properties  in 
the monument and provide access by members of Indian tribes for traditional 
cultural  and  customary  uses,  consistent  with  the  American  Indian  Religious 
Freedom  Act  (42  U.S.C.  1996)  and  Executive  Order  13007  of  May  24,  1996 
(Indian  Sacred  Sites),  including  collection  of  medicines,  berries  and  other 
vegetation,  forest  products,  and  firewood  for  personal  noncommercial  use 
in a manner consistent with the care and management of the objects identified 
above. 
For  purposes  of  protecting  and  restoring  the  objects  identified  above,  the 
Secretaries  shall  prepare  a  transportation  plan  that  designates  the  roads 
and  trails  where  motorized  and  non-motorized  mechanized  vehicle  use  will 
be  allowed.  Except  for  emergency  or  authorized  administrative  purposes, 
motorized and non-motorized mechanized vehicle use shall be allowed only 
on  roads  and  trails  designated  for  such  use,  consistent  with  the  care  and 
management  of  such  objects.  Any  additional  roads  or  trails  designated  for 
motorized vehicle use must be for the purposes of public safety or protection 
of such objects. 
Laws,  regulations,  and  policies  followed  by  USFS  or  BLM  in  issuing  and 
administering  grazing  permits  or  leases  on  lands  under  their  jurisdiction 
shall continue to apply with regard to the lands in the monument to ensure 
the ongoing consistency with the care and management of the objects identi-
fied above. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  enlarge  or  diminish  the 
jurisdiction  of  the  State  of  Utah,  including  its  jurisdiction  and  authority 
with respect to fish and wildlife management. 
Nothing in this proclamation shall preclude low-level overflights of military 
aircraft,  the  designation  of  new  units  of  special  use  airspace,  or  the  use 
or  establishment  of  military  flight  training  routes  over  the  lands  reserved 
by this proclamation consistent with the care and management of the objects 
identified above. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  construed  to  alter  the  authority  or 
responsibility  of  any  party  with  respect  to  emergency  response  activities 
within the monument, including wildland fire response. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation. 
Warning  is  hereby  given  to  all  unauthorized  persons  not  to  appropriate, 
injure,  destroy,  or  remove  any  feature  of  the  monument  and  not  to  locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

27605 

Notice  of  June  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Actions  and  Policies  of  Certain  Members  of  the  Government 
of  Belarus  and  Other  Persons  to  Undermine  Democratic  Proc-
esses  or  Institutions  of  Belarus 

On  June  16,  2006,  by  Executive  Order  13405,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Pow-
ers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  con-
stituted  by  the  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government 
of  Belarus  and  other  persons  to  undermine  democratic  processes  or  institu-
tions of Belarus, manifested in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 
elections;  to  commit  human  rights  abuses  related  to  political  repression, 
including detentions and disappearances; and to engage in public corruption, 
including  by  diverting  or  misusing  Belarusian  public  assets  or  by  misusing 
public authority. 
The  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government  of  Belarus 
and  other  persons  continue  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on June 16, 2006, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  to  address  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  June  16,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13405. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9565  of  January  12,  2017 

Establishment  of 
Monument 

the  Birmingham  Civil  Rights  National 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  A.G.  Gaston  Motel  (Gaston  Motel),  located  in  Birmingham,  Alabama, 
within walking distance of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, Kelly Ingram 
Park,  and  other  landmarks  of  the  American  civil  rights  movement  (move-
ment),  served  as  the  headquarters  for  a  civil  rights  campaign  in  the  spring 
of  1963.  The  direct  action  campaign—known  as  ‘‘Project  C’’  for  confronta-
tion—challenged unfair laws designed to limit the freedoms of African Ameri-
cans  and  ensure  racial  inequality.  Throughout  the  campaign,  Dr.  Martin 
Luther  King,  Jr.,  and  Reverend  Ralph  David  Abernathy  of  the  Southern 
Christian  Leadership  Conference  (SCLC),  Reverend  Fred  L.  Shuttlesworth 
of  the  Alabama  Christian  Movement  for  Human  Rights  (ACMHR),  and  other 
movement leaders rented rooms at the Gaston Motel and held regular strategy 
sessions  there.  They  also  staged  marches  and  held  press  conferences  on 
the  premises.  Project  C  succeeded  in  focusing  the  world’s  attention  on 
racial  injustice  in  America  and  creating  momentum  for  Federal  civil  rights 
legislation that would be enacted in 1964. 
The  Gaston  Motel,  the  highest  quality  accommodation  in  Birmingham  in 
1963 that accepted African Americans, was itself the product of segregation. 
Arthur  George  (A.G.)  Gaston,  a  successful  African  American  businessman 
whose enterprises addressed the needs of his segregated community, opened 
the  motel  in  1954  to  provide  ‘‘something  fine  that  .  .  .  will  be  appreciated 
by our people.’’ In the era of segregation, African Americans faced inconven-
iences,  indignities,  and  personal  risk  in  their  travels.  The  conveniences 
and  comforts  of  the  Gaston  Motel  were  a  rarity  for  them.  The  motel  hosted 
many  travelers  over  the  years,  including  business  and  professional  people; 
celebrities performing in the city; participants in religious, social, and polit-
ical  conferences;  and  in  April–May  1963,  the  movement  leaders,  the  press, 
and  others  who  would  bring  Project  C  to  the  world  stage.  During  Project 
C,  King  and  Abernathy  occupied  the  motel’s  main  suite,  Room  30,  located 
on the second floor above the office and lobby, and they and their colleagues 
held most of their strategy sessions in the suite’s sitting room. 
The  events  at  the  Gaston  Motel  drew  attention  to  State  and  local  laws 
and customs that—a century after the Civil War—promoted racial inequality. 
In January 1963, incoming Alabama Governor George Wallace declared, ‘‘Seg-
regation now! Segregation tomorrow! Segregation forever!’’ Birmingham, Ala-
bama’s  largest  city,  was  a  bastion  of  segregation,  enforced  by  law,  custom, 
and  violence.  The  city  required  the  separation  of  races  at  parks,  pools, 
playgrounds,  hotels,  restaurants,  theaters,  on  buses,  in  taxicabs,  and  else-
where.  Zoning  ordinances  determined  where  African  Americans  could  pur-
chase  property,  and  a  line  of  demarcation  created  a  virtual  wall  around 
the  Fourth  Avenue  business  district  that  served  the  African  American  com-
munity.  Racial  discrimination  pervaded  housing  and  employment.  Violence 
was frequently used to intimidate those who dared to challenge segregation. 
From 1945 to 1963, Birmingham witnessed 60 bombings of African American 
homes,  businesses,  and  churches,  earning 
the  nickname 
‘‘Bombingham.’’

By early 1963, civil rights activism was also well established in Birmingham. 
Civil  rights  leaders  had  been  spurred  into  action  in  1956  when  the  State 
of  Alabama  effectively  outlawed  the  National  Association  for  the  Advance-
ment  of  Colored  People  (NAACP).  A  sheriff  served  Shuttlesworth,  Member-
ship  Chairman  of  the  NAACP’s  Alabama  chapter,  with  an  injunction  at 
the  organization’s  regional  headquarters  in  Birmingham’s  Masonic  Temple, 
where  many  African  American  professionals  and  organizations  had  their 
offices.  In  swift  response,  Shuttlesworth  formed  the  ACMHR  in  June  1956, 
and established its headquarters at his church, Bethel Baptist. Shuttlesworth 
and  the  ACMHR  spearheaded  a  church-led  civil  rights  movement  in  Bir-
mingham:  they  held  mass  meetings  every  Monday  night,  pursued  litigation, 
and initiated direct action campaigns. The ACMHR and Shuttlesworth estab-
lished  ties  with  other  civil  rights  organizations,  and  developed  reputations 
as  serious  forces  in  the  civil  rights  movement.  As  the  primary  Birmingham 
contact  during  the  1961  Freedom  Rides,  Shuttlesworth  and  his  deacons 
rescued  multiple  Freedom  Riders,  sheltering  them  at  Bethel  Baptist  Church 
and its parsonage. Shuttlesworth also worked to cultivate other local protest 
efforts.  In  1962,  he  supported  students  from  Miles  College  as  they  launched 
a  boycott  of  downtown  stores  that  treated  African  Americans  as  second 
class  citizens.  A  year  later  some  of  the  same  students  would  participate 
in Project C. 

Shuttlesworth  encouraged  the  SCLC  to  come  to  Birmingham.  By  early  1963, 
King  and  his  colleagues  decided  that  the  intransigence  of  Birmingham’s 
segregationist power structure, and the strength of its indigenous civil rights 
movement,  created  the  necessary  tension  for  a  campaign  that  could  capture 
the  Nation’s—and  the  Kennedy  Administration’s—attention,  and  pressure 
city  leaders  to  desegregate.  In  the  words  of  King,  ‘‘As  Birmingham  goes, 
so goes the South.’’ 

The plan of the Birmingham campaign was to attack Birmingham’s segregated 
business  practices  during  the  busy  and  lucrative  Easter  shopping  season 
through  nonviolent  direct  action,  including  boycotts,  marches,  and  sit-ins. 
On April 3, 1963, Shuttlesworth distributed a pamphlet entitled ‘‘Birmingham 
Manifesto’’  to  announce  the  campaign  to  the  press  and  encourage  others 
to  join  the  cause.  Sit-ins  at  downtown  stores  began  on  April  3,  as  did 
nightly  mass  meetings.  The  first  march  of  the  campaign  was  on  April  6, 
1963. Participants gathered in the courtyard of the Gaston Motel and started 
to  march  toward  City  Hall,  but  the  police  department  under  the  command 
of  Commissioner  of  Public  Safety  T.  Eugene  ‘‘Bull’’  Connor  stopped  them 
within  three  blocks,  arrested  them,  and  sent  them  to  jail.  The  next  day, 
Birmingham  police,  assisted  by  their  canine  corps,  again  quickly  stopped 
the  march  from  St.  Paul  United  Methodist  Church  toward  City  Hall,  con-
taining the protesters in Kelly Ingram Park. 

Over  the  next  few  days,  as  the  possibility  of  violence  increased,  some 
local  African  American  leaders,  including  A.G.  Gaston,  questioned  Project 
C. In response, King created a 25-person advisory committee to allow discus-
sion  of  the  leaders’  different  viewpoints.  The  advisory  committee  met  daily 
at the Gaston Motel and reviewed each day’s plan. 

On  April  10,  the  city  obtained  an  injunction  against  the  marches  and  other 
demonstrations  from  a  State  court,  and  served  it  on  King,  Abernathy,  and 
Shuttlesworth  in  the  Gaston  Motel  restaurant  at  1:00  a.m.  on  April  11. 
During  the  Good  Friday  march  on  April  12,  King,  Abernathy,  and  others 
were arrested. King was placed in solitary confinement, drawing the attention 
of  the  Kennedy  Administration,  which  began  to  monitor  developments  in 
Birmingham. While jailed, King wrote his famous ‘‘Letter from a Birmingham 
Jail.’’  His  letter  was  a  response  to  a  statement  published  in  the  local  news-
paper  by  eight  moderate  white  clergymen  who  supported  integration  but 
opposed the direct action campaign as ‘‘unwise and untimely.’’ They believed 
that  negotiations  and  legal  processes  were  the  appropriate  means  to  end 
segregation, and without directly naming him, portrayed King as an outsider

trying  to  stir  up  civil  unrest.  In  response,  King  wrote,  ‘‘I  am  in  Birmingham 
because injustice is here.’’ 
While  King  was  in  jail,  the  campaign  lost  momentum.  Upon  King’s  release, 
James  Bevel,  a  young  SCLC  staffer,  proposed  what  would  become  known 
as  the  ‘‘Children’s  Crusade,’’  a  highly  controversial  strategy  aimed  at  cap-
turing  the  Nation’s  attention.  On  May  2—dubbed  D–Day—hundreds  of  Afri-
can American teenagers prepared to march from the Sixteenth Street Baptist 
Church  to  City  Hall.  With  a  crowd  of  bystanders  present,  police  began 
arresting young protesters in Kelly Ingram Park. Overwhelmed by the number 
of  protesters,  estimated  at  1,000,  Commissioner  Connor  called  for  school 
buses  to  transport  those  arrested  to  jail.  On  May  3—Double–D  Day—Connor 
readied his forces for another mass march by stationing police, canine units, 
and  firemen  at  Kelly  Ingram  Park.  As  the  young  protesters  entered  the 
park,  authorities  ordered  them  to  evacuate  the  area;  when  they  did  not 
leave,  firemen  trained  their  water  cannons  on  them.  The  high-pressure  jets 
of  water  knocked  them  to  the  ground  and  tore  at  their  clothing.  Connor 
next  deployed  the  canine  corps  to  disperse  the  crowd.  Police  directed  six 
German  shepherds  towards  the  crowd  and  commanded  them  to  attack.  Re-
porters  documented  the  violence,  and  the  next  day  the  country  was  con-
fronted  with  dramatic  scenes  of  brutal  police  aggression  against  civil  rights 
protesters.  These  vivid  examples  of  segregation  and  racial  injustice  shocked 
the conscience of the Nation and the world. 
The  marches  and  demonstrations  continued.  Fearing  civil  unrest  and  irrep-
arable  damage  to  the  city’s  reputation,  on  May  8  the  Birmingham  business 
community  and  local  leaders  agreed  to  release  the  peaceful  protesters,  inte-
grate  lunch  counters,  and  begin  to  hire  African  Americans.  On  May  10, 
1963,  the  Gaston  Motel  served  as  the  site  to  announce  this  compromise 
between local white leaders and civil rights advocates. The motel was bombed 
around  midnight.  The  bomb  blasted  a  door-sized  hole  into  the  reception 
area  below  King’s  second  story  suite  and  damaged  the  water  main  and 
electrical  lines.  King  was  not  in  Birmingham  at  the  time.  His  brother,  A.D. 
King,  whose  own  home  in  Birmingham  had  been  bombed  earlier  in  the 
day,  worked  to  calm  outraged  African  Americans  and  avoid  an  escalation 
of violence. 
Despite  the  negotiated  peace,  African  Americans  in  Birmingham  continued 
to  face  hostile  resistance  to  integration.  That  fall,  Governor  Wallace,  in 
violation of a Federal court order, directed State troopers to prevent desegre-
gation  of  Alabama  public  schools.  When  a  Federal  court  issued  injunctions 
against the troopers, the Governor called out the National Guard. To counter 
that action, President John F. Kennedy federalized and withdrew the National 
Guard,  thereby  allowing  desegregation.  In  response,  on  September  15,  1963, 
white  supremacists  planted  a  bomb  at  the  Sixteenth  Street  Baptist  Church. 
Addie  Mae  Collins,  Carole  Robertson,  and  Cynthia  Wesley,  all  of  whom 
were  14,  and  Denise  McNair,  11,  were  killed.  The  explosion  injured  22 
others and left significant damage to the church. King traveled to Birmingham 
to  deliver  the  eulogy  for  the  little  girls.  This  act  of  domestic  terrorism 
again shocked the conscience of the Nation and the world. 
Public  outrage  over  the  events  in  Birmingham  produced  political  pressure 
that helped to ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which President 
Lyndon  Johnson  signed  into  law  on  July  2,  1964.  Later  that  year,  the  U.S. 
Supreme  Court  affirmed  the  constitutionality  of  the  public  accommodation 
provisions  (Title  II)  of  the  Act.  Several  Southern  politicians  announced 
that laws must be respected, and across the South outward signs of segrega-
tion began to disappear. 
Partially  as  a  result  of  the  Federal  legislation  outlawing  discrimination  in 
public accommodations, business at the Gaston Motel suffered. African Amer-
icans  had  more  choices  in  motels  and  dining.  When  King  returned  to  Bir-
mingham  for  an  SCLC  conference  in  1964,  he  and  three  dozen  colleagues 
checked  into  the  Parliament  House,  then  considered  Birmingham’s  finest 
hotel.  A.G.  Gaston  modernized  and  expanded  his  motel  in  1968,  adding

a  large  supper  club  and  other  amenities,  but  business  continued  to  fall 
through  the  1970s.  In  1982,  Gaston  announced  that  the  motel  would  be 
converted  into  housing  for  the  elderly  and  handicapped.  The  use  of  the 
property  for  this  purpose  ceased  in  1996,  and  the  former  Gaston  Motel 
has sat vacant ever since. 
Although  some  people  continued  to  resist  integration  following  the  events 
of  the  early  1960s,  the  passage  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  and  its 
enforcement  by  the  Department  of  Justice,  had  the  effect  of  eliminating 
official  segregation  of  public  accommodations.  Today,  the  Gaston  Motel, 
the  Birmingham  Civil  Rights  Historic  District  in  which  the  motel  is  located, 
the  Bethel  Baptist  Church,  and  other  associated  resources  all  stand  as  a 
testament  to  the  heroism  of  those  who  worked  so  hard  to  advance  the 
cause of freedom. 
Thus,  the  sites  of  these  events  contain  objects  of  historic  interest  from 
a critical period in American history. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  the  Birmingham  Civil  Rights  Historic  District  (Historic  District) 
was  listed  in  the  National  Register  of  Historic  Places  (NRHP)  in  2006,  as 
a  nationally  significant  property  associated  with  the  climax  of  the  civil 
rights  struggle  during  the  1956–63  period;  and  the  Historic  District  contains 
three key areas and the streets that connect them, covering 36 acres through-
out the city; and the Gaston Motel, located in the African American commer-
cial  and  cultural  area  known  as  Northside,  is  deemed  a  ‘‘major  significant 
resource’’ in the Historic District; 
WHEREAS, many other Birmingham places have been listed and recognized 
for  their  historic  roles  in  the  Birmingham  civil  rights  story,  including  by 
designation as National Historic Landmarks; 
WHEREAS,  the  City  of  Birmingham  has  donated  to  the  National  Trust  for 
Historic Preservation fee and easement interests in the Gaston Motel, totaling 
approximately  0.23  acres  in  fee  and  0.65  acres  in  a  historic  preservation 
easement; 
WHEREAS,  the  National  Trust  for  Historic  Preservation  has  relinquished 
and  conveyed  all  of  these  lands  and  interests  in  lands  associated  with 
the  Gaston  Motel  to  the  Federal  Government  for  the  purpose  of  establishing 
a unit of the National Park System; 
WHEREAS,  the  designation  of  a  national  monument  to  be  administered 
by  the  National  Park  Service  would  recognize  the  historic  significance  of 
the Gaston Motel in the Birmingham civil rights story and provide a national 
platform for telling that story; 
WHEREAS,  the  City  of  Birmingham  and  the  National  Park  Service  intend 
to  cooperate  in  the  preservation,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Gaston 
Motel,  and  interpretation  and  education  related  to  the  civil  rights  struggle 
in Birmingham; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  the  Gaston 
Motel  in  Birmingham,  Alabama  and  the  historic  objects  associated  with 
it within a portion of the Historic District; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are

Federal  Government  to  be  the  Birmingham  Civil  Rights  National  Monument 
(monument)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as 
a  part  thereof  all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by 
the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accom-
panying  map,  which  is  attached  to  and  forms  a  part  of  this  proclamation. 
The  reserved  Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately 
0.88 acres. The boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined

all  forms  of  entry,  location,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the 
public  land  laws,  from  location,  entry,  and  patent  under  the  mining  laws, 
and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to  mineral  and  geothermal 
leasing. 
The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  If 
the  Federal  Government  acquires  any  lands  or  interests  in  lands  not  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved 
as  a  part  of  the  monument,  and  objects  identified  above  that  are  situated 
upon  those  lands  and  interests  in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument, 
upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government. 
The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument through 
the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent 
with  the  purposes  and  provisions  of  this  proclamation.  The  Secretary  shall 
prepare a management plan, with full public involvement and in coordination 
with the City of Birmingham, within 3 years of the date of this proclamation. 
The management plan shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following 
purposes  for  the  benefit  of  present  and  future  generations:  (1)  to  preserve 
and  protect  the  objects  of  historic  interest  associated  with  the  monument, 
and  (2)  to  interpret  the  objects,  resources,  and  values  related  to  the  civil 
rights  movement.  The  management  plan  shall,  among  other  things,  set  forth 
the  desired  relationship  of  the  monument  to  other  related  resources,  pro-
grams, and organizations, both within and outside the National Park System. 
The  National  Park  Service  is  directed  to  use  applicable  authorities  to  seek 
to  enter  into  agreements  with  others,  including  the  City  of  Birmingham, 
the  Birmingham  Civil  Rights  Institute,  the  Sixteenth  Street  Baptist  Church, 
and  the  Bethel  Baptist  Church,  to  address  common  interests  and  promote 
management  efficiencies,  including  provision  of  visitor  services,  interpreta-
tion  and  education,  establishment  and  care  of  museum  collections,  and 
preservation of historic objects. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation. 
Warning  is  hereby  given  to  all  unauthorized  persons  not  to  appropriate, 
injure,  destroy,  or  remove  any  feature  of  this  monument  and  not  to  locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Executive  Order  13788  of  April  18,  2017 

Buy  American  and  Hire  American 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  to  ensure  the  faithful  execution 
of the laws, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Definitions. As used in this order: 

(a) ‘‘Buy American Laws’’ means all statutes, regulations, rules, and Execu-
tive  Orders  relating  to  Federal  procurement  or  Federal  grants—including 
those  that  refer  to  ‘‘Buy  America’’  or  ‘‘Buy  American’’—that  require,  or 
provide  a  preference  for,  the  purchase  or  acquisition  of  goods,  products, 
or materials produced in the United States, including iron, steel, and manu-
factured goods. 

(b)  ‘‘Produced  in  the  United  States’’  means,  for  iron  and  steel  products, 
that  all  manufacturing  processes,  from  the  initial  melting  stage  through 
the application of coatings, occurred in the United States. 

(c)  ‘‘Petition  beneficiaries’’  means  aliens  petitioned  for  by  employers  to 
become nonimmigrant visa holders with temporary work authorization under 
the H–1B visa program. 

(d)  ‘‘Waivers’’  means  exemptions  from  or  waivers  of  Buy  American  Laws, 
or the procedures and conditions used by an executive department or agency 
(agency)  in  granting  exemptions  from  or  waivers  of  Buy  American  Laws. 
(e)  ‘‘Workers  in  the  United  States’’  and  ‘‘United  States  workers’’  shall 
both  be  defined  as  provided  at  section  212(n)(4)(E)  of  the  Immigration  and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(4)(E)). 
Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to buy American 
and hire American. 

(a) Buy American Laws. In order to promote economic and national security 
and  to  help  stimulate  economic  growth,  create  good  jobs  at  decent  wages, 
strengthen  our  middle  class,  and  support  the  American  manufacturing  and 
defense  industrial  bases,  it  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch 
to  maximize,  consistent  with  law,  through  terms  and  conditions  of  Federal 
financial  assistance  awards  and  Federal  procurements,  the  use  of  goods, 
products, and materials produced in the United States. 

(b)  Hire  American.  In  order  to  create  higher  wages  and  employment  rates 
for  workers  in  the  United  States,  and  to  protect  their  economic  interests, 
it  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  to  rigorously  enforce  and 
administer  the  laws  governing  entry  into  the  United  States  of  workers  from 
abroad,  including  section  212(a)(5)  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act 
(8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(5)). 
Sec.  3.  Immediate  Enforcement  and  Assessment  of  Domestic  Preferences 
According to Buy American Laws. (a) Every agency shall scrupulously mon-
itor,  enforce,  and  comply  with  Buy  American  Laws,  to  the  extent  they 
apply,  and  minimize  the  use  of  waivers,  consistent  with  applicable  law. 
(b)  Within  150  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  heads  of  all  agencies 

shall: 

(i) assess the monitoring of, enforcement of, implementation of, and compli-
ance with Buy American Laws within their agencies; 
(ii)  assess  the  use  of  waivers  within  their  agencies  by  type  and  impact 
on domestic jobs and manufacturing; and

section.  This  report  shall  be  submitted  within  220  days  of  the  date  of 
this  order  and  shall  include  specific  recommendations  to  strengthen  imple-
mentation  of  Buy  American  Laws,  including  domestic  procurement  pref-
erence  policies  and  programs.  Subsequent  reports  on  implementation  of 
Buy  American  Laws  shall  be  submitted  by  each  agency  head  annually  to 
the  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management

portion  of  the  cost  advantage  of  a  foreign-sourced  product  is  the  result 
of  the  use  of  dumped  steel,  iron,  or  manufactured  goods  or  the  use  of 
injuriously  subsidized  steel,  iron,  or  manufactured  goods,  and  it  shall  inte-
grate any findings into its waiver determination as appropriate.

Notice  of  May  9,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Central  African  Republic 

On  May  12,  2014,  by  Executive  Order  13667,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to 
the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by  the  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  the  Central  African  Republic,  which 
has  been  marked  by  a  breakdown  of  law  and  order,  intersectarian  tension, 
widespread  violence  and  atrocities,  and  the  pervasive,  often  forced  recruit-
ment  and  use  of  child  soldiers,  and  which  threatens  the  peace,  security, 
or stability of the Central African Republic and neighboring states. 
The  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  the  Central  African  Republic  continues 
to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and 
foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  May  12,  2014,  to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  May  12,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13667. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Continuation  of  U.S.  Drug  Interdiction  Assistance  to  the  Gov-
ernment  of  Colombia 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[  and]  the  Secretary  of  Defense 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the

Colombia,  that:  (1)  interdiction  of  aircraft  reasonably  suspected  to  be  pri-
marily  engaged  in  illicit  drug  trafficking  in  that  country’s  airspace  is  nec-
essary,  because  of  the  extraordinary  threat  posed  by  illicit  drug  trafficking

procedures  in  place  to  protect  against  innocent  loss  of  life  in  the  air  and 
on the ground in connection with such interdiction, which includes effective 
means  to  identify  and  warn  an  aircraft  before  the  use  of  force  is  directed

(ix)  ensure  that  water  users’  private  property  rights  are  not  encumbered 
when they attempt to secure permits to operate on public lands;

Executive  Order  13776  of  February  9,  2017 

Task  Force  on  Crime  Reduction  and  Public  Safety 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  reduce  crime  and 
restore  public  safety  to  communities  across  the  Nation,  it  is  hereby  ordered 
as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  to  reduce 
crime  in  America.  Many  communities  across  the  Nation  are  suffering  from 
high  rates  of  violent  crime.  A  focus  on  law  and  order  and  the  safety  and 
security  of  the  American  people  requires  a  commitment  to  enforcing  the 
law  and  developing  policies  that  comprehensively  address  illegal  immigra-
tion,  drug  trafficking,  and  violent  crime.  The  Department  of  Justice  shall 
take  the  lead  on  Federal  actions  to  support  law  enforcement  efforts  nation-
wide  and  to  collaborate  with  State,  tribal,  and  local  jurisdictions  to  restore 
public safety to all of our communities. 
Sec.  2.  Task  Force.  (a)  In  furtherance  of  the  policy  described  in  section 
1  of  this  order,  I  hereby  direct  the  Attorney  General  to  establish,  and  to 
appoint  or  designate  an  individual  or  individuals  to  chair,  a  Task  Force 
on  Crime  Reduction  and  Public  Safety  (Task  Force).  The  Attorney  General 
shall,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  provide  administrative  support  and 
funding for the Task Force. 

(b)  The  Attorney  General  shall  determine  the  characteristics  of  the  Task 
Force,  which  shall  be  composed  of  individuals  appointed  or  designated 
by him. 

(c) The Task Force shall: 
(i) exchange information and ideas among its members that will be useful 
in  developing  strategies  to  reduce  crime,  including,  in  particular,  illegal 
immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime; 
(ii)  based  on  that  exchange  of  information  and  ideas,  develop  strategies 
to reduce crime; 
(iii) identify deficiencies in existing laws that have made them less effective 
in  reducing  crime  and  propose  new  legislation  that  could  be  enacted 
to improve public safety and reduce crime; 
(iv) evaluate the availability and adequacy of crime-related data and iden-
tify  measures  that  could  improve  data  collection  in  a  manner  that  will 
aid  in  the  understanding  of  crime  trends  and  in  the  reduction  of  crime; 
and 
(v)  conduct  any  other  studies  and  develop  any  other  recommendations 
as directed by the Attorney General. 
(d)  The  Task  Force  shall  meet  as  required  by  the  Attorney  General  and 
shall  be  dissolved  once  it  has  accomplished  the  objectives  set  forth  in 
subsection (c) of this section, as determined by the Attorney General. 

(e)  The  Task  Force  shall  submit  at  least  one  report  to  the  President 
within  1  year  from  the  date  of  this  order,  and  a  subsequent  report  at 
least  once  per  year  thereafter  while  the  Task  Force  remains  in  existence. 
The  structure  of  the  report  is  left  to  the  discretion  of  the  Attorney  General. 
In  its  first  report  to  the  President  and  in  any  subsequent  reports,  the  Task 
Force  shall  summarize  its  findings  and  recommendations  under  subsections 
(c)(ii) through (c)(v) of this section.

Notice  of  January  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Cuba  and  of  the  Emergency  Authority  Relating  to  the  Regula-
tion  of  the  Anchorage  and  Movement  of  Vessels 

On  February  25,  2016,  by  Proclamation  9398,  the  national  emergency  with 
respect  to  Cuba  was  modified  and  continued  to  reflect  the  re-establishment 
of  diplomatic  relations  between  the  United  States  and  Cuba.  The  unauthor-
ized entry of any U.S.-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues 
to  be  detrimental  to  the  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  Therefore, 
in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50 
U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to 
Cuba and the emergency authority relating to the regulation of the anchorage 
and  movement  of  vessels  set  out  in  Proclamation  6867  as  amended  by 
Proclamation 7757 and as further modified by Proclamation 9398. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Memorandum  of  January  24,  2017 

Construction  of  the  Dakota  Access  Pipeline 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  the  Army 

[Editorial  Note:  Memorandum  of  January  24,  2017  entitled  Construction 
of  the  Dakota  Access  Pipeline,  Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  the 
Army,  Document  Number  2017–02032,  was  originally  published  on  pages 
8661  and  8662  in  the  Federal  Register  of  Monday,  January  30,  2017. 
Due  to  a  discrepancy  between  the  document  the  President  signed  and 
the  electronic  file  used  for  publication,  we  are  republishing  the  signed 
document here, in its entirety.] 

Section  1.  Policy.  The  Dakota  Access  Pipeline  (DAPL)  under  development 
by  Dakota  Access,  LLC,  represents  a  substantial,  multi-billion-dollar  private 
investment  in  our  Nation’s  energy  infrastructure.  This  approximately  1,100- 
mile  pipeline  is  designed  to  carry  approximately  500,000  barrels  per  day 
of  crude  oil  from  the  Bakken  and  Three  Forks  oil  production  areas  in 
North  Dakota  to  oil  markets  in  the  United  States.  At  this  time,  the  DAPL 
is  more  than  90  percent  complete  across  its  entire  route.  Only  a  limited 
portion remains to be constructed. 
I  believe  that  construction  and  operation  of  lawfully  permitted  pipeline 
infrastructure serve the national interest. 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the 
Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct 
as follows: 
Sec.  2.  Directives.  (a)  Pipeline  Approval  Review.  The  Secretary  of  the  Army 
shall  instruct  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  for  Civil  Works  and 
the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE),  including  the  Commanding 
General and Chief of Engineers, to take all actions necessary and appropriate 
to: 

(i)  review  and  approve  in  an  expedited  manner,  to  the  extent  permitted 
by  law  and  as  warranted,  and  with  such  conditions  as  are  necessary 
or  appropriate,  requests  for  approvals  to  construct  and  operate  the  DAPL, 
including  easements  or  rights-of-way  to  cross  Federal  areas  under  section 
28  of  the  Mineral  Leasing  Act,  as  amended,  30  U.S.C.  185;  permits  or 
approvals  under  section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act,  33  U.S.C.  1344; 
permits  or  approvals  under  section  14  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Act, 
33  U.S.C.  408;  and  such  other  Federal  approvals  as  may  be  necessary; 
(ii)  consider,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted,  whether 
to  rescind  or  modify  the  memorandum  by  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the 
Army  for  Civil  Works  dated  December  4,  2016  (Proposed  Dakota  Access 
Pipeline  Crossing  at  Lake  Oahe,  North  Dakota),  and  whether  to  withdraw 
the  Notice  of  Intent  to  Prepare  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  in 
Connection  with  Dakota  Access,  LLC’s  Request  for  an  Easement  to  Cross 
Lake  Oahe,  North  Dakota,  dated  January  18,  2017,  and  published  at  82 
Fed. Reg. 5543; 
(iii)  consider,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted,  prior 
reviews  and  determinations,  including  the  Environmental  Assessment 
issued  in  July  of  2016  for  the  DAPL,  as  satisfying  all  applicable  require-
ments  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C.

Notice  of  March  29,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Sig-
nificant  Malicious  Cyber-Enabled  Activities 

On April 1, 2015, by Executive Order 13694, the President declared a national 
emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States 
constituted  by  the  increasing  prevalence  and  severity  of  malicious  cyber- 
enabled  activities  originating  from,  or  directed  by  persons  located,  in  whole 
or  in  substantial  part,  outside  the  United  States.  On  December  28,  2016, 
the President issued Executive Order 13757 to take additional steps to address 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694. 
These  significant  malicious  cyber-enabled  activities  continue  to  pose  an 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy, 
and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  April  1,  2015,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  April  1,  2017. 
Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies 
Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13694. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Executive  Order  13780  of  March  6,  2017 

Protecting  the  Nation  From  Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  Into  the 
United  States 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nation-
ality  Act  (INA),  8  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.,  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United 
States  Code,  and  to  protect  the  Nation  from  terrorist  activities  by  foreign 
nationals  admitted  to  the  United  States,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy  and  Purpose.  (a)  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States 
to  protect  its  citizens  from  terrorist  attacks,  including  those  committed  by 
foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associ-
ated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions 
Program  (USRAP)  play  a  crucial  role  in  detecting  foreign  nationals  who 
may  commit,  aid,  or  support  acts  of  terrorism  and  in  preventing  those 
individuals  from  entering  the  United  States.  It  is  therefore  the  policy  of 
the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and proce-
dures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP. 

(b)  On  January  27,  2017,  to  implement  this  policy,  I  issued  Executive 
Order  13769  (Protecting  the  Nation  from  Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  into  the 
United States). 

(i)  Among  other  actions,  Executive  Order  13769  suspended  for  90  days 
the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, 
Sudan,  Syria,  and  Yemen.  These  are  countries  that  had  already  been 
identified  as  presenting  heightened  concerns  about  terrorism  and  travel 
to  the  United  States.  Specifically,  the  suspension  applied  to  countries 
referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 
1187(a)(12),  in  which  Congress  restricted  use  of  the  Visa  Waiver  Program 
for  nationals  of,  and  aliens  recently  present  in,  (A)  Iraq  or  Syria,  (B) 
any  country  designated  by  the  Secretary  of  State  as  a  state  sponsor  of 
terrorism  (currently  Iran,  Syria,  and  Sudan),  and  (C)  any  other  country 
designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Director  of  National 
Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, 
Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, 
based  on  consideration  of  three  statutory  factors  related  to  terrorism  and 
national  security:  ‘‘(I)  whether  the  presence  of  an  alien  in  the  country 
or  area  increases  the  likelihood  that  the  alien  is  a  credible  threat  to 
the  national  security  of  the  United  States;  (II)  whether  a  foreign  terrorist 
organization  has  a  significant  presence  in  the  country  or  area;  and  (III) 
whether  the  country  or  area  is  a  safe  haven  for  terrorists.’’  8  U.S.C. 
1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed con-
cerns  about  screening  and  vetting  procedures  following  recent  terrorist 
attacks in this country and in Europe. 
(ii) In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection 
(b)(i)  of  this  section,  I  exercised  my  authority  under  Article  II  of  the 
Constitution  and  under  section  212(f)  of  the  INA,  which  provides  in 
relevant  part:  ‘‘Whenever  the  President  finds  that  the  entry  of  any  aliens 
or  of  any  class  of  aliens  into  the  United  States  would  be  detrimental 
to  the  interests  of  the  United  States,  he  may  by  proclamation,  and  for 
such  period  as  he  shall  deem  necessary,  suspend  the  entry  of  all  aliens 
or  any  class  of  aliens  as  immigrants  or  nonimmigrants,  or  impose  on 
the  entry  of  aliens  any  restrictions  he  may  deem  to  be  appropriate.’’

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  45 / Thursday,  March  9,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

8  U.S.C.  1182(f).  Under  these  authorities,  I  determined  that,  for  a  brief 
period  of  90  days,  while  existing  screening  and  vetting  procedures  were 
under  review,  the  entry  into  the  United  States  of  certain  aliens  from 
the  seven  identified  countries—each  afflicted  by  terrorism  in  a  manner 
that  compromised  the  ability  of  the  United  States  to  rely  on  normal 
decision-making  procedures  about  travel  to  the  United  States—would  be 
detrimental  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  Nonetheless,  I  permitted 
the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  grant 
case-by-case  waivers  when  they  determined  that  it  was  in  the  national 
interest to do so. 
(iii)  Executive  Order  13769  also  suspended  the  USRAP  for  120  days. 
Terrorist  groups  have  sought  to  infiltrate  several  nations  through  refugee 
programs.  Accordingly,  I  temporarily  suspended  the  USRAP  pending  a 
review  of  our  procedures  for  screening  and  vetting  refugees.  Nonetheless, 
I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
to  jointly  grant  case-by-case  waivers  when  they  determined  that  it  was 
in the national interest to do so. 
(iv)  Executive  Order  13769  did  not  provide  a  basis  for  discriminating 
for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed 
for  prioritization  of  refugee  claims  from  members  of  persecuted  religious 
minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, includ-
ing those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority 
sects  within  a  religion.  That  order  was  not  motivated  by  animus  toward 
any  religion,  but  was  instead  intended  to  protect  the  ability  of  religious 
minorities—whoever  they  are  and  wherever  they  reside—to  avail  them-
selves  of  the  USRAP  in  light  of  their  particular  challenges  and  cir-
cumstances. 
(c)  The  implementation  of  Executive  Order  13769  has  been  delayed  by 
litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order 
has  been  temporarily  halted  by  court  orders  that  apply  nationwide  and 
extend  even  to  foreign  nationals  with  no  prior  or  substantial  connection 
to  the  United  States.  On  February  9,  2017,  the  United  States  Court  of 
Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  declined  to  stay  or  narrow  one  such  order 
pending  the  outcome  of  further  judicial  proceedings,  while  noting  that  the 
‘‘political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions’’ 
about  who  should  be  covered  by  a  suspension  of  entry  or  of  refugee  admis-
sions. 

(d)  Nationals  from  the  countries  previously  identified  under  section 
217(a)(12)  of  the  INA  warrant  additional  scrutiny  in  connection  with  our 
immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present height-
ened  threats.  Each  of  these  countries  is  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism,  has 
been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active 
conflict  zones.  Any  of  these  circumstances  diminishes  the  foreign  govern-
ment’s  willingness  or  ability  to  share  or  validate  important  information 
about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the signifi-
cant  presence  in  each  of  these  countries  of  terrorist  organizations,  their 
members,  and  others  exposed  to  those  organizations  increases  the  chance 
that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers 
to  travel  to  the  United  States.  Finally,  once  foreign  nationals  from  these 
countries  are  admitted  to  the  United  States,  it  is  often  difficult  to  remove 
them,  because  many  of  these  countries  typically  delay  issuing,  or  refuse 
to issue, travel documents. 

(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department 
of  State’s  Country  Reports  on  Terrorism  2015  (June  2016),  of  some  of  the 
conditions  in  six  of  the  previously  designated  countries  that  demonstrate 
why  their  nationals  continue  to  present  heightened  risks  to  the  security 
of the United States: 

(i)  Iran.  Iran  has  been  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism  since 
1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, 
Hamas,  and  terrorist  groups  in  Iraq.  Iran  has  also  been  linked  to  support

for  al-Qa’ida  and  has  permitted  al-Qa’ida  to  transport  funds  and  fighters 
through  Iran  to  Syria  and  South  Asia.  Iran  does  not  cooperate  with  the 
United States in counterterrorism efforts. 
(ii)  Libya.  Libya  is  an  active  combat  zone,  with  hostilities  between  the 
internationally  recognized  government  and  its  rivals.  In  many  parts  of 
the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed 
militias  rather  than  state  institutions.  Violent  extremist  groups,  including 
the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS),  have  exploited  these  conditions 
to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides 
some  cooperation  with  the  United  States’  counterterrorism  efforts,  but 
it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, 
enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. 
The  United  States  Embassy  in  Libya  suspended  its  operations  in  2014. 
(iii)  Somalia.  Portions  of  Somalia  have  been  terrorist  safe  havens.  Al- 
Shabaab, an al-Qa’ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country 
for  years  and  continues  to  plan  and  mount  operations  within  Somalia 
and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most coun-
tries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government 
cooperates  with  the  United  States  in  some  counterterrorism  operations 
but  does  not  have  the  capacity  to  sustain  military  pressure  on  or  to 
investigate suspected terrorists. 
(iv)  Sudan.  Sudan  has  been  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism 
since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, includ-
ing  Hizballah  and  Hamas.  Historically,  Sudan  provided  safe  havens  for 
al-Qa’ida  and  other  terrorist  groups  to  meet  and  train.  Although  Sudan’s 
support  to  al-Qa’ida  has  ceased  and  it  provides  some  cooperation  with 
the  United  States’  counterterrorism  efforts,  elements  of  core  al-Qa’ida  and 
ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country. 
(v)  Syria.  Syria  has  been  designated  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism  since 
1979.  The  Syrian  government  is  engaged  in  an  ongoing  military  conflict 
against  ISIS  and  others  for  control  of  portions  of  the  country.  At  the 
same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed 
or  encouraged  extremists  to  pass  through  its  territory  to  enter  Iraq.  ISIS 
continues  to  attract  foreign  fighters  to  Syria  and  to  use  its  base  in  Syria 
to  plot  or  encourage  attacks  around  the  globe,  including  in  the  United 
States.  The  United  States  Embassy  in  Syria  suspended  its  operations  in 
2012.  Syria  does  not  cooperate  with  the  United  States’  counterterrorism 
efforts. 
(vi) Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent 
government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, 
al-Qa’ida  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula  (AQAP),  have  exploited  this  conflict 
to  expand  their  presence  in  Yemen  and  to  carry  out  hundreds  of  attacks. 
Weapons  and  other  materials  smuggled  across  Yemen’s  porous  borders 
are  used  to  finance  AQAP  and  other  terrorist  activities.  In  2015,  the 
United  States  Embassy  in  Yemen  suspended  its  operations,  and  embassy 
staff  were  relocated  out  of  the  country.  Yemen  has  been  supportive  of, 
but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counter-
terrorism efforts. 
(f)  In  light  of  the  conditions  in  these  six  countries,  until  the  assessment 
of  current  screening  and  vetting  procedures  required  by  section  2  of  this 
order  is  completed,  the  risk  of  erroneously  permitting  entry  of  a  national 
of  one  of  these  countries  who  intends  to  commit  terrorist  acts  or  otherwise 
harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accord-
ingly,  while  that  assessment  is  ongoing,  I  am  imposing  a  temporary  pause 
on  the  entry  of  nationals  from  Iran,  Libya,  Somalia,  Sudan,  Syria,  and 
Yemen,  subject  to  categorical  exceptions  and  case-by-case  waivers,  as  de-
scribed in section 3 of this order. 

(g)  Iraq  presents  a  special  case.  Portions  of  Iraq  remain  active  combat 
zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory 
in  northern  and  central  Iraq.  Although  that  influence  has  been  significantly

reduced  due  to  the  efforts  and  sacrifices  of  the  Iraqi  government  and  armed 
forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict 
has  impacted  the  Iraqi  government’s  capacity  to  secure  its  borders  and 
to  identify  fraudulent  travel  documents.  Nevertheless,  the  close  cooperative 
relationship  between  the  United  States  and  the  democratically  elected  Iraqi 
government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the signifi-
cant  presence  of  United  States  forces  in  Iraq,  and  Iraq’s  commitment  to 
combat  ISIS  justify  different  treatment  for  Iraq.  In  particular,  those  Iraqi 
government  forces  that  have  fought  to  regain  more  than  half  of  the  territory 
previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned 
enduring  respect  as  they  battle  an  armed  group  that  is  the  common  enemy 
of  Iraq  and  the  United  States.  In  addition,  since  Executive  Order  13769 
was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance 
travel  documentation,  information  sharing,  and  the  return  of  Iraqi  nationals 
subject  to  final  orders  of  removal.  Decisions  about  issuance  of  visas  or 
granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scru-
tiny  to  determine  if  applicants  have  connections  with  ISIS  or  other  terrorist 
organizations,  or  otherwise  pose  a  risk  to  either  national  security  or  public 
safety. 

(h)  Recent  history  shows  that  some  of  those  who  have  entered  the  United 
States  through  our  immigration  system  have  proved  to  be  threats  to  our 
national  security.  Since  2001,  hundreds  of  persons  born  abroad  have  been 
convicted  of  terrorism-related  crimes  in  the  United  States.  They  have  in-
cluded not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals 
who  first  entered  the  country  as  refugees.  For  example,  in  January  2013, 
two  Iraqi  nationals  admitted  to  the  United  States  as  refugees  in  2009  were 
sentenced  to  40  years  and  to  life  in  prison,  respectively,  for  multiple  ter-
rorism-related  offenses.  And  in  October  2014,  a  native  of  Somalia  who 
had  been  brought  to  the  United  States  as  a  child  refugee  and  later  became 
a  naturalized  United  States  citizen  was  sentenced  to  30  years  in  prison 
for  attempting  to  use  a  weapon  of  mass  destruction  as  part  of  a  plot  to 
detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, 
Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons 
who  entered  the  United  States  as  refugees  are  currently  the  subjects  of 
counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 

(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals 
who  may  commit,  aid,  or  support  acts  of  terrorism  remains  a  matter  of 
grave  concern.  In  light  of  the  Ninth  Circuit’s  observation  that  the  political 
branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspen-
sions  than  are  the  courts,  and  in  order  to  avoid  spending  additional  time 
pursuing  litigation,  I  am  revoking  Executive  Order  13769  and  replacing 
it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories 
of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines 
the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens. 
Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular 
Concern  During  Review  Period.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security, 
in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Director  of  National 
Intelligence,  shall  conduct  a  worldwide  review  to  identify  whether,  and 
if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country 
to  adjudicate  an  application  by  a  national  of  that  country  for  a  visa,  admis-
sion,  or  other  benefit  under  the  INA  (adjudications)  in  order  to  determine 
that  the  individual  is  not  a  security  or  public-safety  threat.  The  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  may  conclude  that  certain  information  is  needed 
from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country. 

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President 
a  report  on  the  results  of  the  worldwide  review  described  in  subsection 
(a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security’s determina-
tion  of  the  information  needed  from  each  country  for  adjudications  and 
a  list  of  countries  that  do  not  provide  adequate  information,  within  20 
days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order.  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security

shall  provide  a  copy  of  the  report  to  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney 
General, and the Director of National Intelligence. 

(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during 
the  review  period  described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section,  to  ensure 
the  proper  review  and  maximum  utilization  of  available  resources  for  the 
screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards 
are  established  to  prevent  infiltration  by  foreign  terrorists,  and  in  light 
of  the  national  security  concerns  referenced  in  section  1  of  this  order, 
I  hereby  proclaim,  pursuant  to  sections  212(f)  and  215(a)  of  the  INA,  8 
U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States 
of  nationals  of  Iran,  Libya,  Somalia,  Sudan,  Syria,  and  Yemen  would  be 
detrimental  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States.  I  therefore  direct  that 
the  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  those  six  countries  be 
suspended  for  90  days  from  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  subject  to 
the  limitations,  waivers,  and  exceptions  set  forth  in  sections  3  and  12 
of this order. 

(d)  Upon  submission  of  the  report  described  in  subsection  (b)  of  this 
section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, 
the  Secretary  of  State  shall  request  that  all  foreign  governments  that  do 
not  supply  such  information  regarding  their  nationals  begin  providing  it 
within 50 days of notification. 

(e)  After  the  period  described  in  subsection  (d)  of  this  section  expires, 
the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of 
State  and  the  Attorney  General,  shall  submit  to  the  President  a  list  of 
countries  recommended  for  inclusion  in  a  Presidential  proclamation  that 
would  prohibit  the  entry  of  appropriate  categories  of  foreign  nationals  of 
countries  that  have  not  provided  the  information  requested  until  they  do 
so  or  until  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  certifies  that  the  country 
has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through 
other  means.  The  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  or  the  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  may  also  submit  to  the  President  the  names  of  addi-
tional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions 
or  limitations  deemed  necessary  for  the  security  or  welfare  of  the  United 
States. 

(f)  At  any  point  after  the  submission  of  the  list  described  in  subsection 
(e)  of  this  section,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation 
with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Attorney  General,  may  submit  to  the 
President  the  names  of  any  additional  countries  recommended  for  similar 
treatment,  as  well  as  the  names  of  any  countries  that  they  recommend 
should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection 
(e) of this section. 

(g)  The  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall 
submit  to  the  President  a  joint  report  on  the  progress  in  implementing 
this  order  within  60  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  a  second 
report  within  90  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  a  third  report 
within  120  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  and  a  fourth  report 
within 150 days of the effective date of this order. 
Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension. 

(a)  Scope.  Subject  to  the  exceptions  set  forth  in  subsection  (b)  of  this 
section  and  any  waiver  under  subsection  (c)  of  this  section,  the  suspension 
of  entry  pursuant  to  section  2  of  this  order  shall  apply  only  to  foreign 
nationals of the designated countries who: 

(i) are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;

(ii)  any  foreign  national  who  is  admitted  to  or  paroled  into  the  United 
States on or after the effective date of this order; 
(iii)  any  foreign  national  who  has  a  document  other  than  a  visa,  valid 
on  the  effective  date  of  this  order  or  issued  on  any  date  thereafter,  that 
permits  him  or  her  to  travel  to  the  United  States  and  seek  entry  or 
admission, such as an advance parole document; 
(iv)  any  dual  national  of  a  country  designated  under  section  2  of  this 
order  when  the  individual  is  traveling  on  a  passport  issued  by  a  non- 
designated country; 
(v)  any  foreign  national  traveling  on  a  diplomatic  or  diplomatic-type  visa, 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  visa,  C–2  visa  for  travel  to  the  United 
Nations, or G–1, G–2, G–3, or G–4 visa; or 
(vi)  any  foreign  national  who  has  been  granted  asylum;  any  refugee  who 
has  already  been  admitted  to  the  United  States;  or  any  individual  who 
has  been  granted  withholding  of  removal,  advance  parole,  or  protection 
under the Convention Against Torture. 
(c)  Waivers.  Notwithstanding  the  suspension  of  entry  pursuant  to  section 
2  of  this  order,  a  consular  officer,  or,  as  appropriate,  the  Commissioner, 
U.S.  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP),  or  the  Commissioner’s  delegee, 
may,  in  the  consular  officer’s  or  the  CBP  official’s  discretion,  decide  on 
a  case-by-case  basis  to  authorize  the  issuance  of  a  visa  to,  or  to  permit 
the  entry  of,  a  foreign  national  for  whom  entry  is  otherwise  suspended 
if  the  foreign  national  has  demonstrated  to  the  officer’s  satisfaction  that 
denying  entry  during  the  suspension  period  would  cause  undue  hardship, 
and  that  his  or  her  entry  would  not  pose  a  threat  to  national  security 
and  would  be  in  the  national  interest.  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  the 
Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  any  waiver  issued  by  a  consular  officer 
as  part  of  the  visa  issuance  process  will  be  effective  both  for  the  issuance 
of  a  visa  and  any  subsequent  entry  on  that  visa,  but  will  leave  all  other 
requirements  for  admission  or  entry  unchanged.  Case-by-case  waivers  could 
be appropriate in circumstances such as the following: 

(i)  the  foreign  national  has  previously  been  admitted  to  the  United  States 
for  a  continuous  period  of  work,  study,  or  other  long-term  activity,  is 
outside  the  United  States  on  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  seeks  to 
reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry 
during the suspension period would impair that activity; 
(ii)  the  foreign  national  has  previously  established  significant  contacts 
with  the  United  States  but  is  outside  the  United  States  on  the  effective 
date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity; 
(iii)  the  foreign  national  seeks  to  enter  the  United  States  for  significant 
business  or  professional  obligations  and  the  denial  of  entry  during  the 
suspension period would impair those obligations; 
(iv)  the  foreign  national  seeks  to  enter  the  United  States  to  visit  or  reside 
with  a  close  family  member  (e.g.,  a  spouse,  child,  or  parent)  who  is 
a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admit-
ted  on  a  valid  nonimmigrant  visa,  and  the  denial  of  entry  during  the 
suspension period would cause undue hardship; 
(v) the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual 
needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified 
by the special circumstances of the case; 
(vi)  the  foreign  national  has  been  employed  by,  or  on  behalf  of,  the 
United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) 
and  the  employee  can  document  that  he  or  she  has  provided  faithful 
and valuable service to the United States Government; 
(vii) the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international 
organization  designated  under  the  International  Organizations  Immunities 
Act  (IOIA),  22  U.S.C.  288  et  seq.,  traveling  for  purposes  of  conducting 
meetings  or  business  with  the  United  States  Government,  or  traveling

to  conduct  business  on  behalf  of  an  international  organization  not  des-
ignated under the IOIA; 
(viii)  the  foreign  national  is  a  landed  Canadian  immigrant  who  applies 
for a visa at a location within Canada; or 
(ix)  the  foreign  national  is  traveling  as  a  United  States  Government-spon-
sored exchange visitor. 

Sec.  4.  Additional  Inquiries  Related  to  Nationals  of  Iraq.  An  application 
by  any  Iraqi  national  for  a  visa,  admission,  or  other  immigration  benefit 
should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consulta-
tion  with  a  designee  of  the  Secretary  of  Defense  and  use  of  the  additional 
information  that  has  been  obtained  in  the  context  of  the  close  U.S.-Iraqi 
security  partnership,  since  Executive  Order  13769  was  issued,  concerning 
individuals  suspected  of  ties  to  ISIS  or  other  terrorist  organizations  and 
individuals  coming  from  territories  controlled  or  formerly  controlled  by 
ISIS.  Such  review  shall  include  consideration  of  whether  the  applicant  has 
connections  with  ISIS  or  other  terrorist  organizations  or  with  territory  that 
is  or  has  been  under  the  dominant  influence  of  ISIS,  as  well  as  any  other 
information  bearing  on  whether  the  applicant  may  be  a  threat  to  commit 
acts  of  terrorism  or  otherwise  threaten  the  national  security  or  public  safety 
of the United States. 
Sec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immi-
gration  Programs.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Sec-
retary  of  Homeland  Security,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  shall 
implement  a  program,  as  part  of  the  process  for  adjudications,  to  identify 
individuals  who  seek  to  enter  the  United  States  on  a  fraudulent  basis, 
who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group 
or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing 
harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development 
of  a  uniform  baseline  for  screening  and  vetting  standards  and  procedures, 
such  as  in-person  interviews;  a  database  of  identity  documents  proffered 
by  applicants  to  ensure  that  duplicate  documents  are  not  used  by  multiple 
applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identi-
fying  fraudulent  answers  and  malicious  intent;  a  mechanism  to  ensure  that 
applicants  are  who  they  claim  to  be;  a  mechanism  to  assess  whether  appli-
cants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist 
acts  after  entering  the  United  States;  and  any  other  appropriate  means  for 
ensuring  the  proper  collection  of  all  information  necessary  for  a  rigorous 
evaluation  of  all  grounds  of  inadmissibility  or  grounds  for  the  denial  of 
other immigration benefits. 

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary 
of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence, 
shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program 
described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  within  60  days  of  the  effective 
date  of  this  order,  a  second  report  within  100  days  of  the  effective  date 
of  this  order,  and  a  third  report  within  200  days  of  the  effective  date 
of this order. 
Sec.  6.  Realignment  of  the  U.S.  Refugee  Admissions  Program  for  Fiscal 
Year  2017.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  suspend  travel  of  refugees  into 
the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall  suspend  decisions  on  applications  for  refugee  status,  for  120  days 
after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection 
(c)  of  this  section.  During  the  120-day  period,  the  Secretary  of  State,  in 
conjunction  with  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  in  consultation 
with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application 
and  adjudication  processes  to  determine  what  additional  procedures  should 
be  used  to  ensure  that  individuals  seeking  admission  as  refugees  do  not 
pose  a  threat  to  the  security  and  welfare  of  the  United  States,  and  shall 
implement  such  additional  procedures.  The  suspension  described  in  this 
subsection  shall  not  apply  to  refugee  applicants  who,  before  the  effective 
date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department 
of  State.  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  resume  travel  of  refugees  into  the

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  45 / Thursday,  March  9,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

United  States  under  the  USRAP  120  days  after  the  effective  date  of  this 
order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions 
on  applications  for  refugee  status  only  for  stateless  persons  and  nationals 
of  countries  for  which  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  have  jointly  determined 
that  the  additional  procedures  implemented  pursuant  to  this  subsection 
are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States. 

(b)  Pursuant  to  section  212(f)  of  the  INA,  I  hereby  proclaim  that  the 
entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental 
to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess 
of  that  number  until  such  time  as  I  determine  that  additional  entries  would 
be in the national interest. 

(c)  Notwithstanding  the  temporary  suspension  imposed  pursuant  to  sub-
section (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Home-
land  Security  may  jointly  determine  to  admit  individuals  to  the  United 
States  as  refugees  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  in  their  discretion,  but  only 
so  long  as  they  determine  that  the  entry  of  such  individuals  as  refugees 
is  in  the  national  interest  and  does  not  pose  a  threat  to  the  security  or 
welfare  of  the  United  States,  including  in  circumstances  such  as  the  fol-
lowing:  the  individual’s  entry  would  enable  the  United  States  to  conform 
its  conduct  to  a  preexisting  international  agreement  or  arrangement,  or  the 
denial of entry would cause undue hardship. 

(d)  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  that,  to  the  extent  permitted 
by  law  and  as  practicable,  State  and  local  jurisdictions  be  granted  a  role 
in  the  process  of  determining  the  placement  or  settlement  in  their  jurisdic-
tions  of  aliens  eligible  to  be  admitted  to  the  United  States  as  refugees. 
To  that  end,  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  examine  existing  law  to  determine 
the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdic-
tions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the place-
ment  or  resettlement  of  refugees  in  their  jurisdictions,  and  shall  devise 
a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement. 
Sec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds 
of  Inadmissibility.  The  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding 
the  exercises  of  authority  permitted  by  section  212(d)(3)(B)  of  the  INA, 
8  U.S.C.  1182(d)(3)(B),  relating  to  the  terrorism  grounds  of  inadmissibility, 
as well as any related implementing directives or guidance. 
Sec.  8.  Expedited  Completion  of  the  Biometric  Entry-Exit  Tracking  System. 
(a)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  expedite  the  completion  and 
implementation  of  a  biometric  entry-exit  tracking  system  for  in-scope  trav-
elers  to  the  United  States,  as  recommended  by  the  National  Commission 
on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. 

(b)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  submit  to  the  President 
periodic  reports  on  the  progress  of  the  directive  set  forth  in  subsection 
(a)  of  this  section.  The  initial  report  shall  be  submitted  within  100  days 
of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 
200  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order,  and  a  third  report  shall  be 
submitted  within  365  days  of  the  effective  date  of  this  order.  The  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  shall  submit  further  reports  every  180  days  thereafter 
until the system is fully deployed and operational. 
Sec.  9.  Visa  Interview  Security.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  immediately 
suspend  the  Visa  Interview  Waiver  Program  and  ensure  compliance  with 
section  222  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1202,  which  requires  that  all  individuals 
seeking  a  nonimmigrant  visa  undergo  an  in-person  interview,  subject  to 
specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign 
national  traveling  on  a  diplomatic  or  diplomatic-type  visa,  North  Atlantic 
Treaty  Organization  visa,  C–2  visa  for  travel  to  the  United  Nations,  or 
G–1, G–2, G–3, or G–4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international 
organization  designated  under  the  IOIA;  or  traveling  for  purposes  of  con-
ducting meetings or business with the United States Government.

(b)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  subject  to  the  availability  of 
appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular 
Fellows  Program,  including  by  substantially  increasing  the  number  of  Fel-
lows,  lengthening  or  making  permanent  the  period  of  service,  and  making 
language  training  at  the  Foreign  Service  Institute  available  to  Fellows  for 
assignment  to  posts  outside  of  their  area  of  core  linguistic  ability,  to  ensure 
that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected. 
Sec.  10.  Visa  Validity  Reciprocity.  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  review  all 
nonimmigrant  visa  reciprocity  agreements  and  arrangements  to  ensure  that 
they  are,  with  respect  to  each  visa  classification,  truly  reciprocal  insofar 
as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 
221(c)  and  281  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1201(c)  and  1351,  and  other  treatment. 
If  another  country  does  not  treat  United  States  nationals  seeking  non-
immigrant  visas  in  a  truly  reciprocal  manner,  the  Secretary  of  State  shall 
adjust  the  visa  validity  period,  fee  schedule,  or  other  treatment  to  match 
the  treatment  of  United  States  nationals  by  that  foreign  country,  to  the 
extent practicable. 
Sec.  11.  Transparency  and  Data  Collection.  (a)  To  be  more  transparent 
with  the  American  people  and  to  implement  more  effectively  policies  and 
practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
in  consultation  with  the  Attorney  General,  shall,  consistent  with  applicable 
law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following 
information: 

(i)  information  regarding  the  number  of  foreign  nationals  in  the  United 
States  who  have  been  charged  with  terrorism-related  offenses  while  in 
the  United  States;  convicted  of  terrorism-related  offenses  while  in  the 
United  States;  or  removed  from  the  United  States  based  on  terrorism- 
related  activity,  affiliation  with  or  provision  of  material  support  to  a 
terrorism-related  organization,  or  any  other  national-security-related  rea-
sons; 
(ii)  information  regarding  the  number  of  foreign  nationals  in  the  United 
States  who  have  been  radicalized  after  entry  into  the  United  States  and 
who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material 
support  to  terrorism-related  organizations  in  countries  that  pose  a  threat 
to the United States; 
(iii)  information  regarding  the  number  and  types  of  acts  of  gender-based 
violence against women, including so-called ‘‘honor killings,’’ in the United 
States by foreign nationals; and 
(iv)  any  other  information  relevant  to  public  safety  and  security  as  deter-
mined  by  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  or  the  Attorney  General, 
including  information  on  the  immigration  status  of  foreign  nationals 
charged with major offenses. 
(b)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  release  the  initial  report 
under  subsection  (a)  of  this  section  within  180  days  of  the  effective  date 
of  this  order  and  shall  include  information  for  the  period  from  September 
11,  2001,  until  the  date  of  the  initial  report.  Subsequent  reports  shall  be 
issued  every  180  days  thereafter  and  reflect  the  period  since  the  previous 
report. 
Sec.  12.  Enforcement.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  Home-
land  Security  shall  consult  with  appropriate  domestic  and  international 
partners, including countries and organizations, to ensure efficient, effective, 
and appropriate implementation of the actions directed in this order. 

(b)  In  implementing  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary 
of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, 
including,  as  appropriate,  those  providing  an  opportunity  for  individuals 
to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determina-
tion  for  aliens  covered  by  section  235(b)(1)(A)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C. 
1225(b)(1)(A).

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  45 / Thursday,  March  9,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

(c)  No  immigrant  or  nonimmigrant  visa  issued  before  the  effective  date 

of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order. 

(d)  Any  individual  whose  visa  was  marked  revoked  or  marked  canceled 
as  a  result  of  Executive  Order  13769  shall  be  entitled  to  a  travel  document 
confirming  that  the  individual  is  permitted  to  travel  to  the  United  States 
and  seek  entry.  Any  prior  cancellation  or  revocation  of  a  visa  that  was 
solely  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  13769  shall  not  be  the  basis  of  inadmis-
sibility for any future determination about entry or admissibility. 

(e)  This  order  shall  not  apply  to  an  individual  who  has  been  granted 
asylum,  to  a  refugee  who  has  already  been  admitted  to  the  United  States, 
or  to  an  individual  granted  withholding  of  removal  or  protection  under 
the  Convention  Against  Torture.  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, withholding of removal, 
or  protection  under  the  Convention  Against  Torture,  consistent  with  the 
laws of the United States. 
Sec.  13.  Revocation.  Executive  Order  13769  of  January  27,  2017,  is  revoked

time on March 16, 2017. 
Sec.  15.  Severability.  (a)  If  any  provision  of  this  order,  or  the  application 
of  any  provision  to  any  person  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid, 
the  remainder  of  this  order  and  the  application  of  its  other  provisions 
to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby. 

(b)  If  any  provision  of  this  order,  or  the  application  of  any  provision 
to  any  person  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid  because  of  the  lack 
of  certain  procedural  requirements,  the  relevant  executive  branch  officials 
shall implement those procedural requirements. 
Sec.  16.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

National  Security  Presidential  Memorandum–3  of  January  28,  2017 

Plan  To  Defeat  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria 

the  Treasury[,] 
the  Secretary  of  Energy[,] 

Memorandum  for  the  Vice  President[,]  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Sec-
retary  of 
the  Attorney 
General[,] 
the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security[,]  the  Assistant  to  the  President  and  Chief  of  Staff[,]  the  Director 
of  National  Intelligence[,]  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National  Se-
curity  Affairs[,]  the  Counsel  to  the  President[,]  the  Director  of  the  Central 
Intelligence  Agency[,  and]  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff 

the  Secretary  of  Defense[,] 

The  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria,  or  ISIS,  is  not  the  only  threat  from 
radical  Islamic  terrorism  that  the  United  States  faces,  but  it  is  among  the 
most  vicious  and  aggressive.  It  is  also  attempting  to  create  its  own  state, 
which  ISIS  claims  as  a  ‘‘caliphate.’’  But  there  can  be  no  accommodation 
or  negotiation  with  it.  For  those  reasons  I  am  directing  my  Administration 
to develop a comprehensive plan to defeat ISIS. 
ISIS is responsible for the violent murder of American citizens in the Middle 
East,  including  the  beheadings  of  James  Foley,  Steven  Sotloff,  and  Peter 
Abdul-Rahman  Kassig,  as  well  as  the  death  of  Kayla  Mueller.  In  addition, 
ISIS  has  inspired  attacks  in  the  United  States,  including  the  December 
2015  attack  in  San  Bernardino,  California,  and  the  June  2016  attack  in 
Orlando,  Florida.  ISIS  is  complicit  in  a  number  of  terrorist  attacks  on  our 
allies in which Americans have been wounded or killed, such as the Novem-
ber 2015 attack in Paris, France, the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, 
the  July  2016  attack  in  Nice,  France,  and  the  December  2016  attack  in 
Berlin, Germany. 
ISIS has engaged in a systematic campaign of persecution and extermination 
in  those  territories  it  enters  or  controls.  If  ISIS  is  left  in  power,  the  threat 
that it poses will only grow. We know it has attempted to develop chemical 
weapons  capability.  It  continues  to  radicalize  our  own  citizens,  and  its 
attacks against our allies and partners continue to mount. The United States 
must take decisive action to defeat ISIS. 
Sec.  1.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  that  ISIS  be  defeated. 
Sec. 2. Policy Coordination. Policy coordination, guidance, dispute resolution, 
and  periodic  in-progress  reviews  for  the  functions  and  programs  described 
and assigned in this memorandum shall be provided through the interagency 
process established in National Security Presidential Memorandum–2 of Janu-
ary  28,  2017  (Organization  of  the  National  Security  Council  and  the  Home-
land Security Council), or any successor. 
Sec. 3. Plan to Defeat ISIS. (a) Scope and Timing. 

(i)  Development  of  a  new  plan  to  defeat  ISIS  (the  Plan)  shall  commence 
immediately. 
(ii)  Within  30  days,  a  preliminary  draft  of  the  Plan  to  defeat  ISIS  shall 
be submitted to the President by the Secretary of Defense. 
(iii) The Plan shall include: 

(A) a comprehensive strategy and plans for the defeat of ISIS; 
(B)  recommended  changes  to  any  United  States  rules  of  engagement 
and  other  United  States  policy  restrictions  that  exceed  the  requirements 
of international law regarding the use of force against ISIS;

isolate and delegitimize ISIS and its radical Islamist ideology; 

(D)  identification  of  new  coalition  partners  in  the  fight  against  ISIS 
and  policies  to  empower  coalition  partners  to  fight  ISIS  and  its  affiliates; 
(E)  mechanisms  to  cut  off  or  seize  ISIS’s  financial  support,  including 
financial transfers, money laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, sales 
of looted art and historical artifacts, and other revenue sources; and 

(F) a detailed strategy to robustly fund the Plan. 

(b) Participants. The Secretary of Defense shall develop the Plan in collabo-
ration with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security,  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  the  Chairman 
of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National 
Security  Affairs,  and  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Homeland  Security

(c)  Development  of  the  Plan.  Consistent  with  applicable  law,  the  Partici-
pants identified in subsection (b) of this section shall compile all information 
in  the  possession  of  the  Federal  Government  relevant  to  the  defeat  of  ISIS 
and its affiliates. All executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent 
permitted  by  law,  promptly  comply  with  any  request  of  the  Participants 
to  provide  information  in  their  possession  or  control  pertaining  to  ISIS. 
The  Participants  may  seek  further  information  relevant  to  the  Plan  from 
any appropriate source. 

(d)  The  Secretary  of  Defense  is  hereby  authorized  and  directed  to  publish 

this memorandum in the Federal Register.

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury[, 
and]  the  Secretary  of  Energy 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States,  after  carefully  considering  the  reports  submitted 
to  the  Congress  by  the  Energy  Information  Administration,  including  the 
report  submitted  April  11,  2017,  and  other  relevant  factors  such  as  global 
economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, the level 
of  spare  petroleum  production  capacity,  and  the  availability  of  strategic 
reserves, I determine, pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National 
Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2012,  Public  Law  112–81,  and 
consistent  with  prior  determinations,  that  there  is  a  sufficient  supply  of 
petroleum  and  petroleum  products  from  countries  other  than  Iran  to  permit 
a  significant  reduction  in  the  volume  of  petroleum  and  petroleum  products 
purchased  from  Iran  by  or  through  foreign  financial  institutions.  As  my 
Administration  conducts  a  review  of  its  Iran  policy,  and  consistent  with 
United  States  commitments  specified  in  the  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of 
Action,  however,  the  United  States  is  not  pursuing  efforts  to  reduce  Iran’s 
sales of crude oil at this time. 
I will continue to monitor this situation closely.

Proclamation  9645  of  September  24,  2017 

Enhancing  Vetting  Capabilities  and  Processes  for  Detecting 
Attempted  Entry  Into  the  United  States  by  Terrorists  or 
Other  Public-Safety  Threats 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  Executive  Order  13780  of  March  6,  2017  (Protecting  the  Nation  from 
Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  into  the  United  States),  on  the  recommendations 
of  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  the  Attorney  General,  I  ordered 
a  worldwide  review  of  whether,  and  if  so  what,  additional  information 
would  be  needed  from  each  foreign  country  to  assess  adequately  whether 
their  nationals  seeking  to  enter  the  United  States  pose  a  security  or  safety 
threat.  This  was  the  first  such  review  of  its  kind  in  United  States  history. 
As part of the review, the Secretary of Homeland Security established global 
requirements  for  information  sharing  in  support  of  immigration  screening 
and vetting. The Secretary of Homeland Security developed a comprehensive 
set  of  criteria  and  applied  it  to  the  information-sharing  practices,  policies, 
and  capabilities  of  foreign  governments.  The  Secretary  of  State  thereafter 
engaged  with  the  countries  reviewed  in  an  effort  to  address  deficiencies 
and  achieve  improvements.  In  many  instances,  those  efforts  produced  posi-
tive  results.  By  obtaining  additional  information  and  formal  commitments 
from  foreign  governments,  the  United  States  Government  has  improved  its 
capacity  and  ability  to  assess  whether  foreign  nationals  attempting  to  enter 
the  United  States  pose  a  security  or  safety  threat.  Our  Nation  is  safer  as 
a result of this work. 
Despite  those  efforts,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation 
with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Attorney  General,  has  determined  that 
a  small  number  of  countries—out  of  nearly  200  evaluated—remain  deficient 
at  this  time  with  respect  to  their  identity-management  and  information- 
sharing  capabilities,  protocols,  and  practices.  In  some  cases,  these  countries 
also have a significant terrorist presence within their territory. 
As  President,  I  must  act  to  protect  the  security  and  interests  of  the  United 
States  and  its  people.  I  am  committed  to  our  ongoing  efforts  to  engage 
those  countries  willing  to  cooperate,  improve  information-sharing  and  iden-
tity-management  protocols  and  procedures,  and  address  both  terrorism-re-
lated and public-safety risks. Some of the countries with remaining inadequa-
cies  face  significant  challenges.  Others  have  made  strides  to  improve  their 
protocols  and  procedures,  and  I  commend  them  for  these  efforts.  But  until 
they  satisfactorily  address  the  identified  inadequacies,  I  have  determined, 
on  the  basis  of  recommendations  from  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security 
and other members of my Cabinet, to impose certain conditional restrictions 
and  limitations,  as  set  forth  more  fully  below,  on  entry  into  the  United 
States of nationals of the countries identified in section 2 of this proclamation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me 
by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including 
sections  212(f)  and  215(a)  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  (INA), 
8  U.S.C.  1182(f)  and  1185(a),  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States 
Code,  hereby  find  that,  absent  the  measures  set  forth  in  this  proclamation, 
the  immigrant  and  nonimmigrant  entry  into  the  United  States  of  persons 
described  in  section  2  of  this  proclamation  would  be  detrimental  to  the

interests  of  the  United  States,  and  that  their  entry  should  be  subject  to 
certain  restrictions,  limitations,  and  exceptions.  I  therefore  hereby  proclaim 
the following: 
Section  1.  Policy  and  Purpose.  (a)  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States 
to  protect  its  citizens  from  terrorist  attacks  and  other  public-safety  threats. 
Screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with visa adjudica-
tions  and  other  immigration  processes  play  a  critical  role  in  implementing 
that  policy.  They  enhance  our  ability  to  detect  foreign  nationals  who  may 
commit,  aid,  or  support  acts  of  terrorism,  or  otherwise  pose  a  safety  threat, 
and  they  aid  our  efforts  to  prevent  such  individuals  from  entering  the 
United States. 

(b)  Information-sharing  and  identity-management  protocols  and  practices 
of  foreign  governments  are  important  for  the  effectiveness  of  the  screening 
and  vetting  protocols  and  procedures  of  the  United  States.  Governments 
manage  the  identity  and  travel  documents  of  their  nationals  and  residents. 
They  also  control  the  circumstances  under  which  they  provide  information 
about  their  nationals  to  other  governments,  including  information  about 
known  or  suspected  terrorists  and  criminal-history  information.  It  is,  there-
fore,  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  take  all  necessary  and  appropriate 
steps to encourage foreign governments to improve their information-sharing 
and  identity-management  protocols  and  practices  and  to  regularly  share 
identity  and  threat  information  with  our  immigration  screening  and  vetting 
systems. 

(c)  Section  2(a)  of  Executive  Order  13780  directed  a  ‘‘worldwide  review 
to  identify  whether,  and  if  so  what,  additional  information  will  be  needed 
from  each  foreign  country  to  adjudicate  an  application  by  a  national  of 
that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudica-
tions)  in  order  to  determine  that  the  individual  is  not  a  security  or  public- 
safety threat.’’ That review culminated in a report submitted to the President 
by  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  on  July  9,  2017.  In  that  review, 
the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of 
State  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  developed  a  baseline  for 
the  kinds  of  information  required  from  foreign  governments  to  support  the 
United  States  Government’s  ability  to  confirm  the  identity  of  individuals 
seeking  entry  into  the  United  States  as  immigrants  and  nonimmigrants, 
as  well  as  individuals  applying  for  any  other  benefit  under  the  immigration 
laws,  and  to  assess  whether  they  are  a  security  or  public-safety  threat. 
That baseline incorporates three categories of criteria: 

(i)  Identity-management  information.  The  United  States  expects  foreign 
governments  to  provide  the  information  needed  to  determine  whether 
individuals  seeking  benefits  under  the  immigration  laws  are  who  they 
claim  to  be.  The  identity-management  information  category  focuses  on 
the  integrity  of  documents  required  for  travel  to  the  United  States.  The 
criteria  assessed  in  this  category  include  whether  the  country  issues  elec-
tronic  passports  embedded  with  data  to  enable  confirmation  of  identity, 
reports  lost  and  stolen  passports  to  appropriate  entities,  and  makes  avail-
able upon request identity-related information not included in its passports. 
(ii)  National  security  and  public-safety  information.  The  United  States 
expects foreign governments to provide information about whether persons 
who  seek  entry  to  this  country  pose  national  security  or  public-safety 
risks.  The  criteria  assessed  in  this  category  include  whether  the  country 
makes  available,  directly  or  indirectly,  known  or  suspected  terrorist  and 
criminal-history  information  upon  request,  whether  the  country  provides 
passport and national-identity document exemplars, and whether the coun-
try  impedes  the  United  States  Government’s  receipt  of  information  about 
passengers and crew traveling to the United States. 
(iii) National security and public-safety risk assessment. The national secu-
rity and public-safety risk assessment category focuses on national security 
risk  indicators.  The  criteria  assessed  in  this  category  include  whether 
the  country  is  a  known  or  potential  terrorist  safe  haven,  whether  it  is

a  participant  in  the  Visa  Waiver  Program  established  under  section  217 
of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187, that meets all of its requirements, and whether 
it  regularly  fails  to  receive  its  nationals  subject  to  final  orders  of  removal 
from the United States. 
(d) The Department of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Depart-
ment  of  State,  collected  data  on  the  performance  of  all  foreign  governments 
and  assessed  each  country  against  the  baseline  described  in  subsection  (c) 
of  this  section.  The  assessment  focused,  in  particular,  on  identity  manage-
ment, security and public-safety threats, and national security risks. Through 
this  assessment,  the  agencies  measured  each  country’s  performance  with 
respect  to  issuing  reliable  travel  documents  and  implementing  adequate 
identity-management and information-sharing protocols and procedures, and 
evaluated  terrorism-related  and  public-safety  risks  associated  with  foreign 
nationals seeking entry into the United States from each country. 

(e)  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  evaluated  each  country  against 
the  baseline  described  in  subsection  (c)  of  this  section.  The  Secretary  of 
Homeland  Security  identified  16  countries  as  being  ‘‘inadequate’’  based  on 
an analysis of their identity-management protocols, information-sharing prac-
tices,  and  risk  factors.  Thirty-one  additional  countries  were  classified  ‘‘at 
risk’’ of becoming ‘‘inadequate’’ based on those criteria. 

(f)  As  required  by  section  2(d)  of  Executive  Order  13780,  the  Department 
of  State  conducted  a  50-day  engagement  period  to  encourage  all  foreign 
governments,  not  just  the  47  identified  as  either  ‘‘inadequate’’  or  ‘‘at  risk,’’ 
to  improve  their  performance  with  respect  to  the  baseline  described  in 
subsection (c) of this section. Those engagements yielded significant improve-
ments  in  many  countries.  Twenty-nine  countries,  for  example,  provided 
travel  document  exemplars  for  use  by  Department  of  Homeland  Security 
officials  to  combat  fraud.  Eleven  countries  agreed  to  share  information  on 
known or suspected terrorists. 

(g)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  assesses  that  the  following  coun-
tries continue to have ‘‘inadequate’’ identity-management protocols, informa-
tion-sharing practices, and risk factors, with respect to the baseline described 
in  subsection  (c)  of  this  section,  such  that  entry  restrictions  and  limitations 
are  recommended:  Chad,  Iran,  Libya,  North  Korea,  Syria,  Venezuela,  and 
Yemen.  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  also  assesses  that  Iraq  did 
not  meet  the  baseline,  but  that  entry  restrictions  and  limitations  under 
a  Presidential  proclamation  are  not  warranted.  The  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security  recommends,  however,  that  nationals  of  Iraq  who  seek  to  enter 
the  United  States  be  subject  to  additional  scrutiny  to  determine  if  they 
pose  risks  to  the  national  security  or  public  safety  of  the  United  States. 
In reaching these conclusions, the Secretary of Homeland Security considered 
the  close  cooperative  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  the  demo-
cratically  elected  government  of  Iraq,  the  strong  United  States  diplomatic 
presence  in  Iraq,  the  significant  presence  of  United  States  forces  in  Iraq, 
and  Iraq’s  commitment  to  combating  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria 
(ISIS). 

(h) Section 2(e) of Executive Order 13780 directed the Secretary of Home-
land  Security  to  ‘‘submit  to  the  President  a  list  of  countries  recommended 
for  inclusion  in  a  Presidential  proclamation  that  would  prohibit  the  entry 
of  appropriate  categories  of  foreign  nationals  of  countries  that  have  not 
provided  the  information  requested  until  they  do  so  or  until  the  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  certifies  that  the  country  has  an  adequate  plan  to 
do  so,  or  has  adequately  shared  information  through  other  means.’’  On 
September  15,  2017,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  submitted  a  report 
to  me  recommending  entry  restrictions  and  limitations  on  certain  nationals 
of 7 countries determined to be ‘‘inadequate’’ in providing such information 
and  in  light  of  other  factors  discussed  in  the  report.  According  to  the 
report,  the  recommended  restrictions  would  help  address  the  threats  that 
the countries’ identity-management protocols, information-sharing inadequa-
cies,  and  other  risk  factors  pose  to  the  security  and  welfare  of  the  United

States. The restrictions also encourage the countries to work with the United 
States  to  address  those  inadequacies  and  risks  so  that  the  restrictions  and 
limitations  imposed  by  this  proclamation  may  be  relaxed  or  removed  as 
soon as possible. 

(i) In evaluating the recommendations of the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity  and  in  determining  what  restrictions  to  impose  for  each  country, 
I  consulted  with  appropriate  Assistants  to  the  President  and  members 
of  the  Cabinet,  including  the  Secretaries  of  State,  Defense,  and  Homeland 
Security, and the Attorney General. I considered several factors, including 
each  country’s  capacity,  ability,  and  willingness  to  cooperate  with  our 
identity-management  and  information-sharing  policies  and  each  country’s 
risk  factors,  such  as  whether  it  has  a  significant  terrorist  presence  within 
its territory. I also considered foreign policy, national security, and counter-
terrorism  goals.  I  reviewed  these  factors  and  assessed  these  goals,  with 
a particular focus on crafting those country-specific restrictions that would 
be  most  likely  to  encourage  cooperation  given  each  country’s  distinct 
circumstances, and that would, at the same time, protect the United States 
until  such  time  as  improvements  occur.  The  restrictions  and  limitations 
imposed  by  this  proclamation  are,  in  my  judgment,  necessary  to  prevent 
the entry of those foreign nationals about whom the United States Govern-
ment  lacks  sufficient  information  to  assess  the  risks  they  pose  to  the 
United  States.  These  restrictions  and  limitations  are  also  needed  to  elicit 
improved  identity-management  and  information-sharing  protocols  and 
practices from foreign governments; and to advance foreign policy, national 
security, and counterterrorism objectives. 
(ii)  After  reviewing  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security’s  report  of  Sep-
tember  15,  2017,  and  accounting  for  the  foreign  policy,  national  security, 
and  counterterrorism  objectives  of  the  United  States,  I  have  determined 
to  restrict  and  limit  the  entry  of  nationals  of  7  countries  found  to  be 
‘‘inadequate’’  with  respect  to  the  baseline  described  in  subsection  (c) 
of  this  section:  Chad,  Iran,  Libya,  North  Korea,  Syria,  Venezuela,  and 
Yemen.  These  restrictions  distinguish  between  the  entry  of  immigrants 
and  nonimmigrants.  Persons  admitted  on  immigrant  visas  become  lawful 
permanent  residents  of  the  United  States.  Such  persons  may  present  na-
tional  security  or  public-safety  concerns  that  may  be  distinct  from  those 
admitted  as  nonimmigrants.  The  United  States  affords  lawful  permanent 
residents  more  enduring  rights  than  it  does  to  nonimmigrants.  Lawful 
permanent  residents  are  more  difficult  to  remove  than  nonimmigrants 
even  after  national  security  concerns  arise,  which  heightens  the  costs 
and  dangers  of  errors  associated  with  admitting  such  individuals.  And 
although  immigrants  generally  receive  more  extensive  vetting  than  non-
immigrants,  such  vetting  is  less  reliable  when  the  country  from  which 
someone seeks to emigrate exhibits significant gaps in its identity-manage-
ment  or  information-sharing  policies,  or  presents  risks  to  the  national 
security of the United States. For all but one of those 7 countries, therefore, 
I am restricting the entry of all immigrants. 
(iii) I am adopting a more tailored approach with respect to nonimmigrants, 
in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security.  For  some  countries  found  to  be  ‘‘inadequate’’  with  respect  to 
the  baseline  described  in  subsection  (c)  of  this  section,  I  am  restricting 
the  entry  of  all  nonimmigrants.  For  countries  with  certain  mitigating  fac-
tors,  such  as  a  willingness  to  cooperate  or  play  a  substantial  role  in 
combatting  terrorism,  I  am  restricting  the  entry  only  of  certain  categories 
of  nonimmigrants,  which  will  mitigate  the  security  threats  presented  by 
their entry into the United States. In those cases in which future coopera-
tion  seems  reasonably  likely,  and  accounting  for  foreign  policy,  national 
security,  and  counterterrorism  objectives,  I  have  tailored  the  restrictions 
to encourage such improvements. 
(i) Section 2(e) of Executive Order 13780 also provided that the ‘‘Secretary 
of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  may 
also  submit  to  the  President  the  names  of  additional  countries  for  which

any  of  them  recommends  other  lawful  restrictions  or  limitations  deemed 
necessary  for  the  security  or  welfare  of  the  United  States.’’  The  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security  determined  that  Somalia  generally  satisfies  the  infor-
mation-sharing  requirements  of  the  baseline  described  in  subsection  (c)  of 
this  section,  but  its  government’s  inability  to  effectively  and  consistently 
cooperate, combined with the terrorist threat that emanates from its territory, 
present  special  circumstances  that  warrant  restrictions  and  limitations  on 
the  entry  of  its  nationals  into  the  United  States.  Somalia’s  identity-manage-
ment  deficiencies  and  the  significant  terrorist  presence  within  its  territory 
make  it  a  source  of  particular  risks  to  the  national  security  and  public 
safety  of  the  United  States.  Based  on  the  considerations  mentioned  above, 
and  as  described  further  in  section  2(h)  of  this  proclamation,  I  have  deter-
mined  that  entry  restrictions,  limitations,  and  other  measures  designed  to 
ensure  proper  screening  and  vetting  for  nationals  of  Somalia  are  necessary 
for the security and welfare of the United States. 

(j)  Section  2  of  this  proclamation  describes  some  of  the  inadequacies 
that  led  me  to  impose  restrictions  on  the  specified  countries.  Describing 
all  of  those  reasons  publicly,  however,  would  cause  serious  damage  to 
the  national  security  of  the  United  States,  and  many  such  descriptions 
are classified. 
Sec. 2. Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Identified Concern. 
The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  the  following  countries 
is hereby suspended and limited, as follows, subject to categorical exceptions 
and case-by-case waivers, as described in sections 3 and 6 of this proclama-
tion: 

(a) Chad. 
(i) The government of Chad is an important and valuable counterterrorism 
partner  of  the  United  States,  and  the  United  States  Government  looks 
forward to expanding that cooperation, including in the areas of immigra-
tion  and  border  management.  Chad  has  shown  a  clear  willingness  to 
improve  in  these  areas.  Nonetheless,  Chad  does  not  adequately  share 
public-safety  and  terrorism-related  information  and  fails  to  satisfy  at  least 
one  key  risk  criterion.  Additionally,  several  terrorist  groups  are  active 
within  Chad  or  in  the  surrounding  region,  including  elements  of  Boko 
Haram,  ISIS-West  Africa,  and  al-Qa’ida  in  the  Islamic  Maghreb.  At  this 
time,  additional  information  sharing  to  identify  those  foreign  nationals 
applying  for  visas  or  seeking  entry  into  the  United  States  who  represent 
national security and public-safety threats is necessary given the significant 
terrorism-related risk from this country. 
(ii)  The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  Chad,  as  immigrants, 
and  as  nonimmigrants  on  business  (B–1),  tourist  (B–2),  and  business/ 
tourist (B–1/B–2) visas, is hereby suspended. 
(b) Iran. 
(i)  Iran  regularly  fails  to  cooperate  with  the  United  States  Government 
in  identifying  security  risks,  fails  to  satisfy  at  least  one  key  risk  criterion, 
is the source of significant terrorist threats, and fails to receive its nationals 
subject to final orders of removal from the United States. The Department 
of State has also designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
(ii)  The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  Iran  as  immigrants 
and  as  nonimmigrants  is  hereby  suspended,  except  that  entry  by  such 
nationals  under  valid  student  (F  and  M)  and  exchange  visitor  (J)  visas 
is not suspended, although such individuals should be subject to enhanced 
screening and vetting requirements. 
(c) Libya. 
(i) The government of Libya is an important and valuable counterterrorism 
partner  of  the  United  States,  and  the  United  States  Government  looks 
forward to expanding on that cooperation, including in the areas of immi-
gration and border management. Libya, nonetheless, faces significant chal-
lenges  in  sharing  several  types  of  information,  including  public-safety

and  terrorism-related  information  necessary  for  the  protection  of  the  na-
tional  security  and  public  safety  of  the  United  States.  Libya  also  has 
significant  inadequacies  in  its  identity-management  protocols.  Further, 
Libya  fails  to  satisfy  at  least  one  key  risk  criterion  and  has  been  assessed 
to  be  not  fully  cooperative  with  respect  to  receiving  its  nationals  subject 
to final orders of removal from the United States. The substantial terrorist 
presence  within  Libya’s  territory  amplifies  the  risks  posed  by  the  entry 
into the United States of its nationals. 
(ii)  The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  Libya,  as  immigrants, 
and  as  nonimmigrants  on  business  (B–1),  tourist  (B–2),  and  business/ 
tourist (B–1/B–2) visas, is hereby suspended. 
(d) North Korea. 
(i)  North  Korea  does  not  cooperate  with  the  United  States  Government 
in  any  respect  and  fails  to  satisfy  all  information-sharing  requirements. 
(ii)  The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  North  Korea  as  immi-
grants and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended. 
(e) Syria. 
(i)  Syria  regularly  fails  to  cooperate  with  the  United  States  Government 
in  identifying  security  risks,  is  the  source  of  significant  terrorist  threats, 
and  has  been  designated  by  the  Department  of  State  as  a  state  sponsor 
of  terrorism.  Syria  has  significant  inadequacies  in  identity-management 
protocols,  fails  to  share  public-safety  and  terrorism  information,  and  fails 
to satisfy at least one key risk criterion. 
(ii)  The  entry  into  the  United  States  of  nationals  of  Syria  as  immigrants 
and nonimmigrants is hereby suspended. 
(f) Venezuela. 
(i)  Venezuela  has  adopted  many  of  the  baseline  standards  identified  by 
the Secretary of Homeland Security and in section 1 of this proclamation, 
but  its  government  is  uncooperative  in  verifying  whether  its  citizens  pose 
national  security  or  public-safety  threats.  Venezuela’s  government  fails 
to  share  public-safety  and  terrorism-related  information  adequately,  fails 
to  satisfy  at  least  one  key  risk  criterion,  and  has  been  assessed  to  be 
not  fully  cooperative  with  respect  to  receiving  its  nationals  subject  to 
final  orders  of  removal  from  the  United  States.  There  are,  however,  alter-
native  sources  for  obtaining  information  to  verify  the  citizenship  and 
identity of nationals from Venezuela. As a result, the restrictions imposed 
by  this  proclamation  focus  on  government  officials  of  Venezuela  who 
are responsible for the identified inadequacies. 
(ii)  Notwithstanding  section  3(b)(v)  of  this  proclamation,  the  entry  into 
the United States of officials of government agencies of Venezuela involved 
in screening and vetting procedures—including the Ministry of the Popular 
Power for Interior, Justice and Peace; the Administrative Service of Identi-
fication,  Migration  and  Immigration;  the  Scientific,  Penal  and  Criminal 
Investigation  Service  Corps;  the  Bolivarian  National  Intelligence  Service; 
and  the  Ministry  of  the  Popular  Power  for  Foreign  Relations—and  their 
immediate  family  members,  as  nonimmigrants  on  business  (B–1),  tourist 
(B–2),  and  business/tourist  (B–1/B–2)  visas,  is  hereby  suspended.  Further, 
nationals  of  Venezuela  who  are  visa  holders  should  be  subject  to  appro-
priate  additional  measures  to  ensure  traveler  information  remains  current. 
(g) Yemen. 
(i) The government of Yemen is an important and valuable counterterrorism 
partner,  and  the  United  States  Government  looks  forward  to  expanding 
that cooperation, including in the areas of immigration and border manage-
ment.  Yemen,  nonetheless,  faces  significant  identity-management  chal-
lenges,  which  are  amplified  by  the  notable  terrorist  presence  within  its 
territory. The government of Yemen fails to satisfy critical identity-manage-
ment requirements, does not share public-safety and terrorism-related infor-
mation  adequately,  and  fails  to  satisfy  at  least  one  key  risk  criterion.

(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Yemen as immigrants, 
and  as  nonimmigrants  on  business  (B–1),  tourist  (B–2),  and  business/ 
tourist (B–1/B–2) visas, is hereby suspended. 
(h) Somalia. 
(i)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security’s  report  of  September  15,  2017, 
determined  that  Somalia  satisfies  the  information-sharing  requirements 
of  the  baseline  described  in  section  1(c)  of  this  proclamation.  But  several 
other  considerations  support  imposing  entry  restrictions  and  limitations 
on Somalia. Somalia has significant identity-management deficiencies. For 
example,  while  Somalia  issues  an  electronic  passport,  the  United  States 
and  many  other  countries  do  not  recognize  it.  A  persistent  terrorist  threat 
also  emanates  from  Somalia’s  territory.  The  United  States  Government 
has  identified  Somalia  as  a  terrorist  safe  haven.  Somalia  stands  apart 
from other countries in the degree to which its government lacks command 
and  control  of  its  territory,  which  greatly  limits  the  effectiveness  of  its 
national capabilities in a variety of respects. Terrorists use under-governed 
areas  in  northern,  central,  and  southern  Somalia  as  safe  havens  from 
which  to  plan,  facilitate,  and  conduct  their  operations.  Somalia  also  re-
mains  a  destination  for  individuals  attempting  to  join  terrorist  groups 
that  threaten  the  national  security  of  the  United  States.  The  State  Depart-
ment’s  2016  Country  Reports  on  Terrorism  observed  that  Somalia  has 
not sufficiently degraded the ability of terrorist groups to plan and mount 
attacks from its territory. Further, despite having made significant progress 
toward  formally  federating  its  member  states,  and  its  willingness  to  fight 
terrorism, Somalia continues to struggle to provide the governance needed 
to limit terrorists’ freedom of movement, access to resources, and capacity 
to  operate.  The  government  of  Somalia’s  lack  of  territorial  control  also 
compromises  Somalia’s  ability,  already  limited  because  of  poor  record-
keeping,  to  share  information  about  its  nationals  who  pose  criminal  or 
terrorist  risks.  As  a  result  of  these  and  other  factors,  Somalia  presents 
special concerns that distinguish it from other countries. 
(ii) The entry into the United States of nationals of Somalia as immigrants 
is  hereby  suspended.  Additionally,  visa  adjudications  for  nationals  of  So-
malia  and  decisions  regarding  their  entry  as  nonimmigrants  should  be 
subject  to  additional  scrutiny  to  determine  if  applicants  are  connected 
to terrorist organizations or otherwise pose a threat to the national security 
or public safety of the United States. 

Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspensions and Limitations. (a) Scope. 
Subject  to  the  exceptions  set  forth  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  section  and

(iv)  any  dual  national  of  a  country  designated  under  section  2  of  this 
proclamation  when  the  individual  is  traveling  on  a  passport  issued  by 
a non-designated country; 
(v)  any  foreign  national  traveling  on  a  diplomatic  or  diplomatic-type  visa, 
North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  visa,  C–2  visa  for  travel  to  the  United 
Nations, or G–1, G–2, G–3, or G–4 visa; or 
(vi)  any  foreign  national  who  has  been  granted  asylum  by  the  United 
States;  any  refugee  who  has  already  been  admitted  to  the  United  States; 
or  any  individual  who  has  been  granted  withholding  of  removal,  advance 
parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture. 
(c)  Waivers.  Notwithstanding  the  suspensions  of  and  limitations  on  entry 
set forth in section 2 of this proclamation, a consular officer, or the Commis-
sioner,  United  States  Customs  and  Border  Protection  (CBP),  or  the  Commis-
sioner’s  designee,  as  appropriate,  may,  in  their  discretion,  grant  waivers 
on  a  case-by-case  basis  to  permit  the  entry  of  foreign  nationals  for  whom 
entry is otherwise suspended or limited if such foreign nationals demonstrate 
that waivers would be appropriate and consistent with subsections (i) through 
(iv) of this subsection. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland 
Security  shall  coordinate  to  adopt  guidance  addressing  the  circumstances 
in  which  waivers  may  be  appropriate  for  foreign  nationals  seeking  entry 
as immigrants or nonimmigrants. 

(i)  A  waiver  may  be  granted  only  if  a  foreign  national  demonstrates  to 
the consular officer’s or CBP official’s satisfaction that: 

(A)  denying  entry  would  cause  the  foreign  national  undue  hardship; 
(B)  entry  would  not  pose  a  threat  to  the  national  security  or  public 

safety of the United States; and 

(C) entry would be in the national interest. 

(ii)  The  guidance  issued  by  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of 
Homeland  Security  under  this  subsection  shall  address  the  standards, 
policies, and procedures for: 

(A)  determining  whether  the  entry  of  a  foreign  national  would  not 
pose  a  threat  to  the  national  security  or  public  safety  of  the  United 
States; 

(B)  determining  whether  the  entry  of  a  foreign  national  would  be  in 

the national interest; 

(C)  addressing  and  managing  the  risks  of  making  such  a  determination 
in  light  of  the  inadequacies  in  information  sharing,  identity  management, 
and other potential dangers posed by the nationals of individual countries 
subject  to  the  restrictions  and  limitations  imposed  by  this  proclamation; 
(D)  assessing  whether  the  United  States  has  access,  at  the  time  of  the 
waiver  determination,  to  sufficient  information  about  the  foreign  national 
to  determine  whether  entry  would  satisfy  the  requirements  of  subsection 
(i) of this subsection; and 

(E)  determining  the  special  circumstances  that  would  justify  granting 

a waiver under subsection (iv)(E) of this subsection. 
(iii)  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security, 
any  waiver  issued  by  a  consular  officer  as  part  of  the  visa  adjudication 
process  will  be  effective  both  for  the  issuance  of  a  visa  and  for  any 
subsequent  entry  on  that  visa,  but  will  leave  unchanged  all  other  require-
ments for admission or entry. 
(iv)  Case-by-case  waivers  may  not  be  granted  categorically,  but  may  be 
appropriate,  subject  to  the  limitations,  conditions,  and  requirements  set 
forth  under  subsection  (i)  of  this  subsection  and  the  guidance  issued 
under  subsection  (ii)  of  this  subsection,  in  individual  circumstances  such 
as the following:

The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State, devise a process to assess whether any suspensions and limitations

and procedures based on the criteria set forth in section 1 of this proclamation 
and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security’s  report  of  September  15,  2017. 
Within  180  days  of  the  date  of  this  proclamation,  and  every  180  days

Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, 
and  other  appropriate  heads  of  agencies,  shall  submit  a  report  with  rec-
ommendations  to  the  President,  through  appropriate  Assistants  to  the  Presi-

the  restrictions  and  limitations  imposed  by  section  2  of  this  proclamation 
should be continued, modified, terminated, or supplemented; and

(ii)  the  interests  of  the  United  States,  if  any,  that  require  the  suspension 
of,  or  limitations  on,  the  entry  of  certain  classes  of  nationals  of  countries 
not identified in this proclamation. 
(b) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland 
Security,  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Director  of 
National  Intelligence,  and  the  head  of  any  other  executive  department  or 
agency  (agency)  that  the  Secretary  of  State  deems  appropriate,  shall  engage 
the countries listed in section 2 of this proclamation, and any other countries

(c)  Notwithstanding  the  process  described  above,  and  consistent  with  the 
process  described  in  section  2(f)  of  Executive  Order  13780,  if  the  Secretary

ney  General,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  determines,  at  any 
time, that a country meets the standards of the baseline described in section 
1(c)  of  this  proclamation,  that  a  country  has  an  adequate  plan  to  provide 
such  information,  or  that  one  or  more  of  the  restrictions  or  limitations 
imposed  on  the  entry  of  a  country’s  nationals  are  no  longer  necessary  for 
the  security  or  welfare  of  the  United  States,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security  may  recommend  to  the  President  the  removal  or  modification  of

countries  for  which  any  of  them  recommends  any  lawful  restrictions  or 
limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States. 
Sec.  5.  Reports  on  Screening  and  Vetting  Procedures.  (a)  The  Secretary

ney  General,  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  and  other  appropriate

Security  on  the  basis  of  a  validation  study,  made  in  applications  for 
immigration benefits under the immigration laws; and 
(iii)  evaluate  the  procedures  related  to  screening  and  vetting  established 
by the Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs in order to enhance 
the safety and security of the United States and to ensure sufficient review

(b)  In  implementing  this  proclamation,  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the 
Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  comply  with  all  applicable  laws  and 
regulations,  including  those  that  provide  an  opportunity  for  individuals

(c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the applicable effec-
tive  date  under  section  7  of  this  proclamation  shall  be  revoked  pursuant 
to this proclamation. 

(d)  Any  individual  whose  visa  was  marked  revoked  or  marked  canceled 
as  a  result  of  Executive  Order  13769  of  January  27,  2017  (Protecting  the 
Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States), shall be entitled 
to  a  travel  document  confirming  that  the  individual  is  permitted  to  travel 
to  the  United  States  and  seek  entry  under  the  terms  and  conditions  of 
the  visa  marked  revoked  or  marked  canceled.  Any  prior  cancellation  or 
revocation  of  a  visa  that  was  solely  pursuant  to  Executive  Order  13769 
shall  not  be  the  basis  of  inadmissibility  for  any  future  determination  about 
entry or admissibility. 

(e)  This  proclamation  shall  not  apply  to  an  individual  who  has  been 
granted  asylum  by  the  United  States,  to  a  refugee  who  has  already  been 
admitted  to  the  United  States,  or  to  an  individual  granted  withholding 
of  removal  or  protection  under  the  Convention  Against  Torture.  Nothing 
in  this  proclamation  shall  be  construed  to  limit  the  ability  of  an  individual 
to  seek  asylum,  refugee  status,  withholding  of  removal,  or  protection  under 
the  Convention  Against  Torture,  consistent  with  the  laws  of  the  United 
States. 
Sec.  7.  Effective  Dates.  Executive  Order  13780  ordered  a  temporary  pause 
on  the  entry  of  foreign  nationals  from  certain  foreign  countries.  In  two 
cases, however, Federal courts have enjoined those restrictions. The Supreme 
Court has stayed those injunctions as to foreign nationals who lack a credible 
claim  of  a  bona  fide  relationship  with  a  person  or  entity  in  the  United 
States, pending its review of the decisions of the lower courts. 

(a) The restrictions and limitations established in section 2 of this proclama-
tion  are  effective  at  3:30  p.m.  eastern  daylight  time  on  September  24,  2017, 
for foreign nationals who: 

(i)  were  subject  to  entry  restrictions  under  section  2  of  Executive  Order 
13780,  or  would  have  been  subject  to  the  restrictions  but  for  section 
3 of that Executive Order, and 
(ii)  lack  a  credible  claim  of  a  bona  fide  relationship  with  a  person  or 
entity in the United States. 
(b) The restrictions and limitations established in section 2 of this procla-
mation  are  effective  at  12:01  a.m.  eastern  daylight  time  on  October  18, 
2017,  for  all  other  persons  subject  to  this  proclamation,  including  nationals 
of: 

(i)  Iran,  Libya,  Syria,  Yemen,  and  Somalia  who  have  a  credible  claim 
of  a  bona  fide  relationship  with  a  person  or  entity  in  the  United  States; 
and 
(ii) Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela. 

Sec.  8.  Severability.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  enforce  this 
proclamation  to  the  maximum  extent  possible  to  advance  the  national  secu-
rity,  foreign  policy,  and  counterterrorism  interests  of  the  United  States. 
Accordingly: 

(a) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision 
to  any  person  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid,  the  remainder  of 
this  proclamation  and  the  application  of  its  other  provisions  to  any  other 
persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby; and 

(b) if any provision of this proclamation, or the application of any provision 
to  any  person  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid  because  of  the  lack 
of  certain  procedural  requirements,  the  relevant  executive  branch  officials 
shall  implement  those  procedural  requirements  to  conform  with  existing 
law and with any applicable court orders. 
Sec. 9. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this proclamation shall be construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

9965 

Executive  Order  13772  of  February  3,  2017 

Core  Principles  for  Regulating  the  United  States  Financial 
System 

By  the  power  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws 
of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  shall  be  the  policy  of  my  Administration  to  regulate 
the United States financial system in a manner consistent with the following 
principles of regulation, which shall be known as the Core Principles: 

(a)  empower  Americans  to  make  independent  financial  decisions  and  in-
formed choices in the marketplace, save for retirement, and build individual 
wealth; 

(b) prevent taxpayer-funded bailouts; 
(c)  foster  economic  growth  and  vibrant  financial  markets  through  more 
rigorous  regulatory  impact  analysis  that  addresses  systemic  risk  and  market 
failures, such as moral hazard and information asymmetry; 

(d)  enable  American  companies  to  be  competitive  with  foreign  firms  in 

domestic and foreign markets; 

(e) advance American interests in international financial regulatory negotia-

tions and meetings; 

(f)  make  regulation  efficient,  effective,  and  appropriately  tailored;  and 
(g)  restore  public  accountability  within  Federal  financial  regulatory  agen-

cies and rationalize the Federal financial regulatory framework. 
Sec.  2.  Directive  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury.  The  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury shall consult with the heads of the member agencies of the Financial 
Stability  Oversight  Council  and  shall  report  to  the  President  within  120 
days  of  the  date  of  this  order  (and  periodically  thereafter)  on  the  extent 
to which existing laws, treaties, regulations, guidance, reporting and record-
keeping requirements, and other Government policies promote the Core Prin-
ciples  and  what  actions  have  been  taken,  and  are  currently  being  taken, 
to promote and support the Core Principles. That report, and all subsequent 
reports,  shall  identify  any  laws,  treaties,  regulations,  guidance,  reporting 
and recordkeeping requirements, and other Government policies that inhibit 
Federal  regulation  of  the  United  States  financial  system  in  a  manner  con-
sistent with the Core Principles. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

The  President 

Presidential Documents

45417 

Memorandum  of  September  25,  2017 

Increasing  Access  to  High-Quality  Science,  Technology,  Engi-
neering,  and  Mathematics  (STEM)  Education 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Education 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  directed  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  A  key  priority  of  my  Administration  is  to  better  equip 
America’s  young  people  with  the  relevant  knowledge  and  skills  that  will 
enable  them  to  secure  high-paying,  stable  jobs  throughout  their  careers. 
With  the  growing  role  of  technology  in  driving  the  American  economy, 
many  jobs  increasingly  require  skills  in  science,  technology,  engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM)—including, in particular, Computer Science. These 
skills  open  the  door  to  jobs,  strengthening  the  backbone  of  American  inge-
nuity, driving solutions to complex problems across industries, and improv-
ing  lives  around  the  world.  As  part  of  my  Administration’s  commitment 
to  supporting  American  workers  and  increasing  economic  growth  and  pros-
perity, it is critical that we educate and train our future workforce to compete 
and excel in lucrative and important STEM fields. 
Today,  too  many  of  our  Nation’s  K–12  and  post-secondary  students  lack 
access  to  high-quality  STEM  education,  and  thus  are  at  risk  of  being  shut 
out  from  some  of  the  most  attractive  job  options  in  the  growing  United 
States  economy.  Courses  in  Computer  Science  are  especially  scarce  in  too 
many  schools  and  communities,  despite  the  job  opportunities  that  these 
skills  create.  Nearly  40  percent  of  high  schools  do  not  offer  physics  and 
60  percent  of  high  schools  do  not  offer  computer  programming.  Of  the 
nearly 17,000 high schools that were accredited to offer Advanced Placement 
exams in 2015, only 18 percent were accredited to teach Advanced Placement 
Computer  Science  (AP–CS).  Minorities  and  students  in  rural  communities 
often  have  even  less  access  to  Computer  Science  education.  Nationwide, 
only  34  percent  of  African  American  students  and  30  percent  of  rural  high 
school students have access to a Computer Science class. Furthermore, even 
where  classes  are  offered,  there  is  a  serious  gender  gap:  less  than  a  quarter 
of  the  students  who  took  the  AP–CS  A  exam  nationally  in  2016  were 
girls. 
Shortages  in  high-quality  STEM  teachers  at  all  levels,  particularly  in  Com-
puter  Science,  often  drive  these  problems.  The  Department  of  Education, 
therefore, should prioritize helping districts recruit and train teachers capable 
of  providing  students  with  a  rigorous  education  in  STEM  fields,  focusing 
in  particular  on  Computer  Science.  This  will  help  equip  students  with 
the skills needed to obtain certifications and advanced degrees that ultimately 
lead to jobs in STEM fields. 
Sec.  2.  Expanding  Access  to  Computer  Science  and  STEM  Education.  (a) 
Establish promotion of high-quality STEM education, with a particular focus 
on  Computer  Science,  as  a  Department  of  Education  priority.  The  Secretary 
of  Education  (Secretary)  shall,  consistent  with  law,  establish  the  promotion 
of  high-quality  STEM  education,  including  Computer  Science  in  particular, 
as  one  of  the  priorities  of  the  Department  of  Education.  The  Secretary 
shall  take  this  priority  into  account,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  when 
awarding grant funds in fiscal year 2018 and in future years.

(b)  Funding  level.  The  Secretary  shall,  to  the  extent  consistent  with  law, 
establish  a  goal  of  devoting  at  least  $200  million  in  grant  funds  per  year 
to  the  promotion  of  high-quality  STEM  education,  including  Computer 
Science in particular. Within 30 days of the Congress passing final appropria-
tions for each fiscal year for which the priority established under subsection 
(a) of this section is in effect, the Secretary shall identify the grant programs 
to  which  the  STEM  priority  will  apply  and  estimate  the  total  amount  of 
such  grant  funds  that  will  support  high-quality  STEM  education,  including 
Computer  Science.  The  Secretary  shall  communicate  plans  for  achieving 
this  goal  to  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB 
Director) each fiscal year. 

(c)  Explore  administrative  actions  to  promote  Computer  Science  at  the 
Department of Education. The Secretary shall explore appropriate administra-
tive  actions,  to  the  extent  consistent  with  law,  to  add  or  increase  focus 
on  Computer  Science  in  existing  K–12  and  post-secondary  programs.  As 
part  of  this  effort,  the  Secretary  shall  identify  and  take  action  to  provide 
guidance documents and other technical assistance that could support high- 
quality Computer Science education. 

(d)  Report.  Not  later  than  90  days  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year, 
the  Secretary  shall  submit  to  the  OMB  Director  a  report  on  the  activities 
carried  out  during  the  preceding  fiscal  year  under  subsections  (b)  and  (c) 
of  this  section.  In  particular,  the  report  shall  describe  how  the  grant  funds 
referenced  in  subsection  (b)  were  spent,  any  administrative  actions  that 
were  taken,  guidance  documents  that  were  released,  or  technical  assistance 
that  was  provided  pursuant  to  subsection  (c)  of  this  section,  and  whether 
these  actions  succeeded  in  promoting  and  expanding  access  to  high-quality 
STEM  education,  including  Computer  Science  in  particular,  both  generally 
and with respect to underserved populations. 
Sec.  3.  Definition.  The  term  ‘‘Computer  Science’’  means  the  study  of  com-
puters and algorithmic processes and includes the study of computing prin-
ciples  and  theories,  computer  hardware,  software  design,  coding,  analytics, 
and computer applications. 
Sec.  4.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii) the functions of the OMB Director relating to budgetary, administrative, 
or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable 

law and subject to the availability of appropriations.

Presidential Documents

Memorandum  of  June  14,  2017 

Effective  Date  in  Executive  Order  13780 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Attorney  General[,]  the 
Secretary  of  Homeland  Security[,  and]  the  Director  of  National  Intel-
ligence 

This memorandum provides guidance for the Secretary of State, the Attorney 
General,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  and  the  Director  of  National 
Intelligence  in  light  of  two  preliminary  injunctions  that  bar  enforcement 
of  certain  provisions  of  Executive  Order  13780,  ‘‘Protecting  the  Nation  from 
Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  into  the  United  States’’  (Mar.  6,  2017).  The  prelimi-
nary  injunction  entered  by  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District 
of  Maryland,  and  affirmed  in  substantial  part  by  the  United  States  Court 
of  Appeals  for  the  Fourth  Circuit,  bars  enforcement  of  section  2(c)  of  the 
Executive  Order.  The  portions  of  the  preliminary  injunction  entered  by 
the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii that were affirmed 
by  the  recent  decision  of  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth 
Circuit  bar  enforcement  of  certain  provisions  of  sections  2  and  6  of  the 
Executive Order. 
Various  provisions  of  sections  2  and  6  of  the  Executive  Order  (as  well 
as sections 3 and 12(c), which delineate the scope of the suspension contained 
in section 2(c)), refer to the Order’s effective date. Section 14 of the Executive 
Order  provides  that  the  Order  was  effective  at  12:01  a.m.,  eastern  daylight 
time  on  March  16,  2017.  Sections  2  and  6,  however,  were  enjoined  before 
that  effective  date,  and  the  courts  of  appeals  have  affirmed  the  injunctions 
with  respect  to  certain  provisions  of  sections  2  and  6.  As  a  result,  under 
the terms of the Executive Order, the effective date of the enjoined provisions 
(as  well  as  related  provisions  of  sections  3  and  12(c))  is  delayed  or  tolled 
until those injunctions are lifted or stayed. 
In  light  of  questions  in  litigation  about  the  effective  date  of  the  enjoined 
provisions  and  in  the  interest  of  clarity,  I  hereby  declare  the  effective  date 
of  each  enjoined  provision  to  be  the  date  and  time  at  which  the  referenced 
injunctions  are  lifted  or  stayed  with  respect  to  that  provision.  To  the  extent 
it is necessary, this memorandum should be construed to amend the Execu-
tive Order. 
Because  the  injunctions  have  delayed  the  effective  date  of  section  12(c), 
no immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of section 
2(c) shall be revoked pursuant to the Executive Order.

of  Homeland  Security,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  to  jointly 
begin  implementation  of  each  relevant  provision  of  sections  2  and  6  of 
the  Executive  Order  72  hours  after  all  applicable  injunctions  are  lifted  or 
stayed  with  respect  to  that  provision,  to  ensure  an  orderly  and  proper 
implementation  of  those  provisions.  Prior  to  that  time,  consular  officers 
may  issue  valid  visas  to,  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  may 
admit,  otherwise  eligible  aliens  without  regard  to  sections  2  and  6.  If  not 
otherwise  revoked,  visas  and  other  travel  documents  issued  during  this 
period  remain  valid  for  travel  as  if  they  were  issued  prior  to  the  effective 
date.

Notice  of  August  15,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Ex-
port  Control  Regulations 

On  August  17,  2001,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13222  pursuant 
to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et 
seq.). In that order, the President declared a national emergency with respect 
to  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign 
policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States  related  to  the  expiration  of  the 
Export  Administration  Act  of  1979,  as  amended  (50  U.S.C.  4601  et  seq.). 
Because  the  Congress  has  not  renewed  the  Export  Administration  Act,  the 
national  emergency  declared  on  August  17,  2001,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  August  17,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of 
the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1 
year the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13222, as amended 
by Executive Order 13637 of March 8, 2013. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Presidential Documents

Memorandum  of  February  3,  2017 

Fiduciary  Duty  Rule 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Labor 

One  of  the  priorities  of  my  Administration  is  to  empower  Americans  to 
make  their  own  financial  decisions,  to  facilitate  their  ability  to  save  for 
retirement and build the individual wealth necessary to afford typical lifetime 
expenses,  such  as  buying  a  home  and  paying  for  college,  and  to  withstand 
unexpected financial emergencies. 
The  Department  of  Labor’s  (Department)  final  rule  entitled,  Definition  of 
the  Term  ‘‘Fiduciary’’;  Conflict  of  Interest  Rule—Retirement  Investment  Ad-
vice,  81  Fed.  Reg.  20946  (April  8,  2016)  (Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  or  Rule), 
may significantly alter the manner in which Americans can receive financial 
advice,  and  may  not  be  consistent  with  the  policies  of  my  Administration. 
Accordingly,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct  the  following: 
Section  1.  Department  of  Labor  Review  of  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule.  (a)  You 
are  directed  to  examine  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  to  determine  whether 
it  may  adversely  affect  the  ability  of  Americans  to  gain  access  to  retirement 
information  and  financial  advice.  As  part  of  this  examination,  you  shall 
prepare an updated economic and legal analysis concerning the likely impact 
of  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule,  which  shall  consider,  among  other  things,  the 
following: 

(i)  Whether  the  anticipated  applicability  of  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  has 
harmed  or  is  likely  to  harm  investors  due  to  a  reduction  of  Americans’ 
access to certain retirement savings offerings, retirement product structures, 
retirement savings information, or related financial advice; 
(ii)  Whether  the  anticipated  applicability  of  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  has 
resulted in dislocations or disruptions within the retirement services indus-
try that may adversely affect investors or retirees; and 
(iii)  Whether  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  is  likely  to  cause  an  increase  in 
litigation,  and  an  increase  in  the  prices  that  investors  and  retirees  must 
pay to gain access to retirement services. 
(b) If you make an affirmative determination as to any of the considerations 
identified  in  subsection  (a)—or  if  you  conclude  for  any  other  reason  after 
appropriate  review  that  the  Fiduciary  Duty  Rule  is  inconsistent  with  the 
priority  identified  earlier  in  this  memorandum—then  you  shall  publish  for 
notice  and  comment  a  proposed  rule  rescinding  or  revising  the  Rule,  as 
appropriate and as consistent with law. 
Sec.  2.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable 

law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c)  This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right 
or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by

tually  committed  to,  the  following  pledge  upon  becoming  an  appointee: 
‘‘As  a  condition,  and  in  consideration,  of  my  employment  in  the  United 
States  Government  in  an  appointee  position  invested  with  the  public  trust, 
I commit myself to the following obligations, which I understand are binding 
on me and are enforceable under law: 

‘‘1.  I  will  not,  within  5  years  after  the  termination  of  my  employment 
as  an  appointee  in  any  executive  agency  in  which  I  am  appointed  to  serve, 
engage in lobbying activities with respect to that agency. 

‘‘2.  If,  upon  my  departure  from  the  Government,  I  am  covered  by  the 
post-employment  restrictions  on  communicating  with  employees  of  my 
former  executive  agency  set  forth  in  section  207(c)  of  title  18,  United  States 
Code, I agree that I will abide by those restrictions. 

‘‘3.  In  addition  to  abiding  by  the  limitations  of  paragraphs  1  and  2, 
I  also  agree,  upon  leaving  Government  service,  not  to  engage  in  lobbying 
activities  with  respect  to  any  covered  executive  branch  official  or  non- 
career Senior Executive Service appointee for the remainder of the Adminis-
tration. 

‘‘4.  I  will  not,  at  any  time  after  the  termination  of  my  employment  in 
the  United  States  Government,  engage  in  any  activity  on  behalf  of  any 
foreign  government  or  foreign  political  party  which,  were  it  undertaken 
on January 20, 2017, would require me to register under the Foreign Agents 
Registration Act of 1938, as amended. 

‘‘5. I will not accept gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations 

for the duration of my service as an appointee. 

‘‘6.  I  will  not  for  a  period  of  2  years  from  the  date  of  my  appointment 
participate in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly 
and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including 
regulations and contracts. 

‘‘7.  If  I  was  a  registered  lobbyist  within  the  2  years  before  the  date 
of  my  appointment,  in  addition  to  abiding  by  the  limitations  of  paragraph 
6,  I  will  not  for  a  period  of  2  years  after  the  date  of  my  appointment 
participate  in  any  particular  matter  on  which  I  lobbied  within  the  2  years 
before  the  date  of  my  appointment  or  participate  in  the  specific  issue  area 
in which that particular matter falls. 

‘‘8.  I  agree  that  any  hiring  or  other  employment  decisions  I  make  will 
be  based  on  the  candidate’s  qualifications,  competence,  and  experience. 
‘‘9.  I  acknowledge  that  the  Executive  Order  entitled  ’Ethics  Commitments 
by  Executive  Branch  Appointees,’  issued  by  the  President  on  January  28,

procedures  to  implement  this  subsection,  which  shall  include  (but  not  be 
limited  to)  providing  for  factfinding  and  investigation  of  possible  violations 
of this order and for referrals to the Attorney General for his or her consider-
ation pursuant to subsection (c). 

(c) The Attorney General or his or her designee is authorized: 
(1)  upon  receiving  information  regarding  the  possible  breach  of  any  com-
mitment in a signed pledge, to request any appropriate Federal investigative

ments in the pledge he or she signed; and 
(2)  establishment  of  a  constructive  trust  for  the  benefit  of  the  United 
States, requiring an accounting and payment to the United States Treasury 
of  all  money  and  other  things  of  value  received  by,  or  payable  to,  the

and  therefore  Executive  Order  13490  is  hereby  revoked.  No  other  prior 
Executive  Orders  are  repealed  by  this  order.  To  the  extent  that  this  order 
is  inconsistent  with  any  provision  of  any  prior  Executive  Order,  this  order 
shall control. 

(b)  If  any  provision  of  this  order  or  the  application  of  such  provision 
is  held  to  be  invalid,  the  remainder  of  this  order  and  other  dissimilar 
applications of such provision shall not be affected. 

(c)  The  pledge  and  this  order  are  not  intended  to,  and  do  not,  create 
any  right  or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in 
equity  by  any  party  (other  than  by  the  United  States)  against  the  United 
States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, 
or any other person. 

(d)  The  definitions  set  forth  in  this  order  are  solely  applicable  to  the 
terms  of  this  order,  and  are  not  otherwise  intended  to  impair  or  affect

pursuant  to  subsection  (b)  of  this  section,  the  Director  shall  submit  to  the 
President  a  proposed  plan  to  reorganize  the  executive  branch  in  order  to 
improve  the  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and  accountability  of  agencies.  The 
proposed  plan  shall  include,  as  appropriate,  recommendations  to  eliminate 
unnecessary  agencies,  components  of  agencies,  and  agency  programs,  and 
to  merge  functions.  The  proposed  plan  shall  include  recommendations  for 
any legislation or administrative measures necessary to achieve the proposed 
reorganization. 

(d)  In  developing  the  proposed  plan  described  in  subsection  (c)  of  this 
section, the Director shall consider, in addition to any other relevant factors: 
(i)  whether  some  or  all  of  the  functions  of  an  agency,  a  component, 
or  a  program  are  appropriate  for  the  Federal  Government  or  would  be 
better  left  to  State  or  local  governments  or  to  the  private  sector  through 
free enterprise; 
(ii)  whether  some  or  all  of  the  functions  of  an  agency,  a  component, 
or  a  program  are  redundant,  including  with  those  of  another  agency, 
component, or program; 
(iii)  whether  certain  administrative  capabilities  necessary  for  operating 
an agency, a component, or a program are redundant with those of another 
agency, component, or program; 
(iv)  whether  the  costs  of  continuing  to  operate  an  agency,  a  component, 
or a program are justified by the public benefits it provides; and 
(v)  the  costs  of  shutting  down  or  merging  agencies,  components,  or  pro-
grams,  including  the  costs  of  addressing  the  equities  of  affected  agency 
staff. 
(e)  In  developing  the  proposed  plan  described  in  subsection  (c)  of  this 
section,  the  Director  shall  consult  with  the  head  of  each  agency  and,  con-
sistent  with  applicable  law,  with  persons  or  entities  outside  the  Federal

employee  in  the  excepted  service  (other  than  a  position  subject  to  suit-
ability), as a contractor employee, or as a nonappropriated fund employee.

with an individual. 
‘‘(f)  ‘Nonappropriated  fund  employee’  means  an  employee  paid  from  non-
appropriated  funds  of  an  instrumentality  of  the  United  States  under  the

appropriated fund employment. While the Office of Personnel Management 
establishes  the  minimum  adjudicative  criteria  for  suitability  and  fitness 
determinations  for  employment  in  the  civil  service  pursuant  to  the  Civil 
Service  Rules,  the  heads  of  agencies  retain  the  discretion  to  establish 
adjudicative criteria for determining fitness to perform work as a contractor 
employee  or  as  a  nonappropriated  fund  employee.  Such  discretion  shall 
be  exercised  with  due  regard  to  the  regulations  and  guidance  prescribed

contractual  work,  subject  to  applicable  regulations  and  directives  of  the 
Office of Management and Budget.

appropriated  fund  employment.  Contractor  employee  fitness  or  non-
appropriated fund employee fitness is subject to the same position designa-
tion  requirements  and  investigative  standards,  policies,  and  procedures 
as  fitness  determinations  for  civil  service  employees,  as  prescribed  by 
the Office of Personnel Management under the Civil Service Rules. 
‘‘(c) Reciprocity. Fitness determinations and investigations for fitness deter-
minations for contractor employees and for nonappropriated fund employ-
ees  are  subject  to  the  same  reciprocity  requirements  as  those  for  employ-
ment in the civil service, as prescribed by the Office of Personnel Manage-
ment under the Civil Service Rules.’’ 
(d)  Executive  Order  13488  is  revised  by  striking  section  4  in  its  entirety, 
and redesignating sections 5 through 8 as sections 4 through 7, respectively.

(a)  The  preamble  to  Executive  Order  13467  is  revised  to  read  as  follows: 
‘‘By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and 
the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  sections  3301,  7103(b), 
and  7301  of  title  5,  United  States  Code,  and  in  order  to  strengthen  and 
ensure  a  secure,  efficient,  timely,  reciprocal,  and  aligned  system  for  inves-
tigating  and  determining  suitability  or  fitness  for  Government  employment, 
fitness to work as a contractor or a nonappropriated fund employee, eligibility 
for  access  to  classified  information  or  to  hold  a  sensitive  position,  and 
authorization  to  be  issued  a  Federal  credential,  while  providing  fair,  impar-

eligibility for access to classified information shall be aligned using consistent 
standards  to  the  extent  possible,  shall  provide  for  reciprocal  recognition, 
and shall ensure cost-effective, timely, and efficient protection of the national 
interest,  while  providing  fair  treatment  to  those  upon  whom  the  Federal 
Government  relies  to  conduct  our  Nation’s  business  and  protect  national 
security. 

‘‘(b)  The  Government’s  tools,  systems,  and  processes  for  conducting  these 
background investigations and managing sensitive investigative information 
should  keep  pace  with  technological  advancements,  regularly  integrating 
current  best  practices  to  better  anticipate,  detect,  and  counter  malicious 
activities,  and  threats  posed  by  external  or  internal  actors  who  may  seek 
to  do  harm  to  the  Government’s  personnel,  property,  and  information. 
To  help  fulfill  these  responsibilities,  there  shall  be  a  primary  executive 
branch investigative service provider whose mission is to provide effective, 
efficient, and secure background investigations for the Federal Government. 
‘‘(c)  Executive  branch  vetting  policies  and  procedures  shall  be  sustained 
by  an  enhanced  risk-management  approach  that  facilitates  early  detection 
of issues by an informed, aware, and responsible Federal workforce; results 
in quality decisions enabled by improved vetting capabilities; and advances 
Government-wide capabilities through enterprise approaches. 
‘‘(d)  The  appointment  or  retention  of  each  covered  individual  shall  be 
subject to an investigation. Federal investigative standards established pur-
suant to this order shall be designed to develop information as to whether 
the  employment  or  retention  in  employment  in  the  Federal  service  of 
the  person  being  investigated  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  interests  of 
the national security, and the scope of the investigation shall be determined 
in  the  first  instance  according  to  the  degree  of  material  adverse  effect 
the  occupant  of  the  position  sought  to  be  filled  could  bring  about,  by 
virtue of the nature of the position, on the national security.’’ 
‘‘(e) Investigative agencies shall control the reports, information, and other 
investigative  materials  that  are  developed  during  the  vetting  process.  Re-
cipient departments and agencies may retain and use the received reports, 
information,  and  other  investigative  material  within  that  recipient  for  au-
thorized  purposes  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  adjudications,  hearings 
and  appeals,  continuous  evaluation,  inspector  general  functions,  counter-
intelligence,  research,  and  insider  threat  programs),  in  compliance  with 
the  Privacy  Act  of  1974,  as  amended  (section  552a  of  title  5,  United 
States  Code).  Investigative  agencies  shall  ensure  that  their  applicable  Sys-
tem  of  Records  Notices  include,  at  a  minimum,  the  authorized  uses  of 
the  recipient  departments  and  agencies  such  as  those  set  forth  above. 
Recipient  departments  and  agencies  shall  not  make  any  external  releases 
of  received  information,  other  than  to  an  investigative  subject  for  the 
purpose  of  providing  procedural  rights  or  administrative  due  process; 
and  shall  direct  any  other  requests  for  external  releases  of  copies  of 
the reports, information, and other investigative materials to the investiga-
tive  agency.  In  the  event  redisclosure  by  the  recipient  agency  is  required 
by  compulsory  legal  process,  the  recipient  agency  shall  consult  with  the 
investigating  agency.  The  investigative  agency  shall  maintain  the  reports, 
information, and other investigative material in a system of records subject 
to  the  Privacy  Act  and  ensure  that  any  re-disclosure  does  not  violate 
statutory restrictions or result in the unauthorized disclosure of: classified 
information,  information  subject  to  a  claim  of  privilege,  or  information 
that  is  otherwise  lawfully  exempt  from  disclosure.  Subject  to  Security 
Executive  Agent  authorizations  consistent  with  section  3341(e)(5)  of  title 
50,  United  States  Code,  the  investigative  agencies  shall  make  reports, 
information,  and  other  investigative  material  available,  as  necessary,  to 
carry  out  the  responsibilities  set  forth  in  this  order,  including  but  not 
limited  to,  authorized  executive  branch-sponsored  research  and  initiatives 
for enterprise-wide continuous performance improvement of vetting policy 
and procedures, as permitted by law.’’ 
(c)  Section  1.2  of  Executive  Order  13467  is  revised  to  read  as  follows:

implement this provision. 

‘‘(b)  The  aligned  executive  branch-wide  vetting  enterprise  shall  employ

sions  are  in  the  national  interest  and  in  accordance  with  due  process 
requirements,  and  providing  the  Federal  Government  with  an  effective 
trusted workforce. 
‘‘(c)  The  investigative  and  adjudicative  standards  for  fitness  shall,  to  the 
extent  practicable,  be  consistent  with  the  standards  for  suitability.  The

priate biometric or database searches not precluded by law.’’

issued  by  the  applicable  Executive  Agent,  agencies  shall  accept  background 
investigations  and  adjudications  conducted  by  other  authorized  agencies 
unless  an  agency  determines  that  a  particular  background  investigation  or 
adjudication does not sufficiently address the standards used by that agency 
in  determining  the  fitness  of  its  excepted  service  employees  who  cannot 
be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service. Except as described 
above  and  except  to  the  extent  authority  to  apply  additional  requirements 
is  vested  by  statute  in  an  agency,  an  agency  may  not  establish  additional 
investigative  or  adjudicative  requirements  (other  than  requirements  for  the 
conduct of a polygraph examination consistent with law, directive, or regula-
tion) that exceed existing requirements without the approval of the Suitability 
and Credentialing Executive Agent exercising its Suitability Executive Agent 
functions or Security Executive Agent, as appropriate. Any additional require-
ments  approved  by  the  appropriate  Executive  Agent  shall  be  limited  to 
those  that  are  necessary  to  address  significant  needs  unique  to  the  agency 
involved,  to  protect  national  security,  or  to  satisfy  a  requirement  imposed 
by law.’’

laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  order  a  freeze  on  the  hiring 
of Federal civilian employees to be applied across the board in the executive 
branch.  As  part  of  this  freeze,  no  vacant  positions  existing  at  noon  on 
January  22,  2017,  may  be  filled  and  no  new  positions  may  be  created, 
except  in  limited  circumstances.  This  order  does  not  include  or  apply  to 
military  personnel.  The  head  of  any  executive  department  or  agency  may 
exempt  from  the  hiring  freeze  any  positions  that  it  deems  necessary  to 
meet  national  security  or  public  safety  responsibilities.  In  addition,  the 
Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) may grant exemptions 
from this freeze where those exemptions are otherwise necessary. 
Within  90  days  of  the  date  of  this  memorandum,  the  Director  of  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB),  in  consultation  with  the  Director  of 
OPM,  shall  recommend  a  long-term  plan  to  reduce  the  size  of  the  Federal 
Government’s  workforce  through  attrition.  This  order  shall  expire  upon  im-
plementation of the OMB plan. 
Contracting  outside  the  Government  to  circumvent  the  intent  of  this  memo-
randum shall not be permitted. 
This  hiring  freeze  applies  to  all  executive  departments  and  agencies  regard-
less of the sources of their operational and programmatic funding, excepting 
military personnel. 
In  carrying  out  this  memorandum,  I  ask  that  you  seek  efficient  use  of 
existing  personnel  and  funds  to  improve  public  services  and  the  delivery 
of  these  services.  Accordingly,  this  memorandum  does  not  prohibit  making 
reallocations  to  meet  the  highest  priority  needs  and  to  ensure  that  essential 
services are not interrupted and national security is not affected. 
This  memorandum  does  not  limit  the  nomination  and  appointment  of  offi-
cials to positions requiring Presidential appointment or Senate confirmation, 
the  appointment  of  officials  to  non-career  positions  in  the  Senior  Executive 
Service  or  to  Schedule  C  positions  in  the  Excepted  Service,  or  the  appoint-
ment  of  any  other  officials  who  serve  at  the  pleasure  of  the  appointing 
authority.  Moreover,  it  does  not  limit  the  hiring  of  personnel  where  such 
a  limit  would  conflict  with  applicable  law.  This  memorandum  does  not 
revoke  any  appointment  to  Federal  service  made  prior  to  January  22,  2017.

the  Counsel 

As  President,  my  highest  priority  is  to  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of 
the  American  people.  In  order  to  advise  and  assist  me  in  executing  this 
solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests 
of  the  United  States  at  home  and  abroad,  I  hereby  direct  that  my  system 
for national security policy development and decision making shall be orga-
nized as follows: 
A.  The  National  Security  Council,  the  Homeland  Security  Council,  and 
Supporting Staff 
The  National  Security  Act  of  1947,  as  amended,  established  the  National 
Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration 
of  domestic,  foreign,  and  military  policies  relating  to  the  national  security. 
There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC)—established through Exec-
utive  Order  13228  of  October  8,  2001,  and  subsequently  codified  in  the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002—that has the purpose of advising the Presi-
dent on matters pertaining to homeland security. Each Council is also respon-
sible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and func-
tions of the executive departments and agencies. 
The  security  threats  facing  the  United  States  in  the  21st  century  transcend 
international boundaries. Accordingly, the United States Government’s deci-
sion-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain 
equally  adaptive  and  transformative.  Both  Councils  are  statutory  bodies  that

the  President  will  continue  to  chair.  Invitations  to  participate  in  specific 
Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments 
and  agencies,  and  other  senior  officials,  who  are  needed  to  address  the 
issue  or  issues  under  consideration.  When  the  President  is  absent  from 
a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President’s 
direction. 
The Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security 
Advisor) shall be responsible, as appropriate and at the President’s direction, 
for  determining  the  agenda  for  the  NSC  or  HSC,  respectively,  ensuring 
that  the  necessary  papers  are  prepared  and  recording  Council  actions  and 
Presidential  decisions  in  a  timely  manner.  The  Assistant  to  the  President 
for  Homeland  Security  and  Counterterrorism  (Homeland  Security  Advisor)

functions.  When  international  economic  issues  are  on  the  agenda  of  the 
NSC,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Economic  Policy  may,  at  the  sole 
discretion of the National Security Advisor, perform those functions. 
The  NSC  and  HSC  shall  have  as  their  regular  attendees  (both  statutory 
and  non-statutory)  the  President,  the  Vice  President,  the  Secretary  of  State, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, 
the  Secretary  of  Energy,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  the  National 
Security  Advisor,  the  Homeland  Security  Advisor,  and  the  Representative 
of  the  United  States  to  the  United  Nations.  The  Director  of  National  Intel-
ligence  and  the  Chairman  of  the  Joint  Chiefs  of  Staff,  as  statutory  advisors 
to  the  NSC,  shall  also  be  regular  attendees,  as  will  the  Director  of  the 
Central Intelligence Agency. 
When  international  economic  issues  are  on  the  agenda  of  the  NSC,  the 
NSC’s regular attendees will include the Secretary of Commerce, the United 
States Trade Representative, and the Assistant to the President for Economic 
Policy. 
The  Assistant  to  the  President  and  Chief  of  Staff  (Chief  of  Staff  to  the 
President), the Counsel to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President 
for  National  Security  Affairs,  and  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management 
and Budget are invited as attendees to any NSC meeting. 
In  addition  to  the  NSC  and  HSC,  there  is  also  a  single  NSC  staff  within 
the  Executive  Office  of  the  President  that  serves  both  the  NSC  and  HSC. 
The  staff  is  composed  of  regional,  issue-focused,  and  functional  directorates 
and  headed  by  a  single  civilian  Executive  Secretary,  pursuant  to  50  U.S.C. 
3021,  who  is  also  the  Chief  of  Staff.  All  policy  and  staff  activity  decisions 
will  be  transmitted  to  the  Executive  Secretary  for  appropriate  distribution 
and  awareness.  The  purpose  of  the  staff  is  to  advise  the  President,  the 
National  Security  Advisor,  the  Homeland  Security  Advisor,  the  NSC  mem-
bers,  the  HSC  members,  and  others  in  the  White  House;  to  facilitate  the 
implementation  of  Administration  policy;  and  to  help  coordinate  the  na-
tional-security-related  activities  of  the  executive  departments  and  agencies. 
B. The Principals Committee 
The  Principals  Committee  (PC)  shall  continue  to  serve  as  the  Cabinet-level 
senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national 
security interests of the United States. The PC shall be convened and chaired 
by  the  National  Security  Advisor.  The  Homeland  Security  Advisor  may, 
at  the  sole  discretion  of  the  National  Security  Advisor,  also  convene  and 
chair  the  PC.  The  Chair  shall  determine  the  agenda  in  consultation  with 
the appropriate committee members, and the Executive Secretary shall ensure 
that  necessary  papers  are  prepared,  and  that  conclusions  and  decisions 
are communicated in a timely manner. Invitations to participate in or attend 
a  specific  PC  shall  be  extended  at  the  discretion  of  the  Chair,  and  may 
include  those  Cabinet-level  heads  of  executive  departments  and  agencies, 
and other senior officials, who are needed to address any issue under consid-
eration.

The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) 
and for providing objectives and clear guidance. 
D. Policy Coordination Committees 
Management  of  the  development  and  implementation  of  national  security 
policies  by  multiple  executive  departments  and  agencies  typically  shall  be 
accomplished  by  the  PCCs,  with  participation  primarily  occurring  at  the 
Assistant Secretary level. As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordi-
nation  of  national  security  policies,  the  PCCs  shall  provide  policy  analysis 
for  consideration  by  the  more  senior  committees  of  the  national  security 
system and ensure timely responses to the President’s decisions. 
Regional  and  issue-related  PCCs  shall  be  established  at  the  direction  of 
the  DC.  Members  of  the  NSC  staff  (or  National  Economic  Council  staff, 
as  appropriate)  will  chair  the  PCCs;  the  DC,  at  its  discretion,  may  add 
co-chairs to any PCC. The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementa-
tion  of  Presidential  decisions  in  their  respective  policy  areas.  The  Chair 
of  each  PCC,  in  consultation  with  the  Executive  Secretary,  shall  invite  rep-
resentatives  of  other  executive  departments  and  agencies  to  attend  meetings 
of  the  PCC  where  appropriate.  The  Chair  of  each  PCC,  with  the  agreement 
of  the  Executive  Secretary,  may  establish  subordinate  working  groups  to 
assist that PCC in the performance of its duties. 
E. General 
The  President  and  the  Vice  President  may  attend  any  and  all  meetings 
of any entity established by or under this memorandum. 
This  document  is  part  of  a  series  of  National  Security  Presidential  Memo-
randa,  which  have  replaced  both  Presidential  Policy  Directives  and  Presi-
dential Study Directives as the instrument for communicating relevant Presi-
dential decisions. This memorandum shall supersede all other existing Presi-
dential  directives  and  guidance  on  the  organization  or  support  of  the  NSC 
and the HSC, including National Security Presidential Memorandum—2 (Jan-
uary  28,  2017),  which  is  hereby  revoked.  With  regard  to  its  application 
to  economic  matters,  this  document  shall  be  interpreted  in  concert  with 
any  Executive  Order  governing  the  National  Economic  Council  and  with 
Presidential Memoranda signed hereafter that implement it or those Executive 
Orders.

portions thereof, that have been rescinded. 
(b)  Each  agency  RRO  shall  periodically  report  to  the  agency  head  and 

regularly consult with agency leadership. 
Sec.  3.  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Forces.  (a)  Each  agency  shall  establish  a 
Regulatory Reform Task Force composed of: 

(i) the agency RRO; 
(ii)  the  agency  Regulatory  Policy  Officer  designated  under  section  6(a)(2) 
of Executive Order 12866; 
(iii)  a  representative  from  the  agency’s  central  policy  office  or  equivalent

(b)  Unless  otherwise  designated  by  the  agency  head,  the  agency  RRO 

shall chair the agency’s Regulatory Reform Task Force. 

(c)  Each  entity  staffed  by  officials  of  multiple  agencies,  such  as  the  Chief 
Acquisition  Officers  Council,  shall  form  a  joint  Regulatory  Reform  Task 
Force  composed  of  at  least  one  official  described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this 
section  from  each  constituent  agency’s  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Force.  Joint 
Regulatory  Reform  Task  Forces  shall  implement  this  order  in  coordination 
with  the  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Forces  of  their  members’  respective  agen-
cies.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  39 / Wednesday,  March  1,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

(d)  Each  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Force  shall  evaluate  existing  regulations 
(as  defined  in  section  4  of  Executive  Order  13771)  and  make  recommenda-
tions to the agency head regarding their repeal, replacement, or modification, 
consistent  with  applicable  law.  At  a  minimum,  each  Regulatory  Reform 
Task Force shall attempt to identify regulations that: 

(i) eliminate jobs, or inhibit job creation; 
(ii) are outdated, unnecessary, or ineffective; 
(iii) impose costs that exceed benefits; 
(iv)  create  a  serious  inconsistency  or  otherwise  interfere  with  regulatory 
reform initiatives and policies; 
(v)  are  inconsistent  with  the  requirements  of  section  515  of  the  Treasury 
and  General  Government  Appropriations  Act,  2001  (44  U.S.C.  3516  note), 
or  the  guidance  issued  pursuant  to  that  provision,  in  particular  those 
regulations  that  rely  in  whole  or  in  part  on  data,  information,  or  methods 
that  are  not  publicly  available  or  that  are  insufficiently  transparent  to 
meet the standard for reproducibility; or 
(vi) derive from or implement Executive Orders or other Presidential direc-
tives  that  have  been  subsequently  rescinded  or  substantially  modified. 
(e) In performing the evaluation described in subsection (d) of this section, 
each  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Force  shall  seek  input  and  other  assistance, 
as  permitted  by  law,  from  entities  significantly  affected  by  Federal  regula-
tions,  including  State,  local,  and  tribal  governments,  small  businesses,  con-
sumers, non-governmental organizations, and trade associations. 

(f)  When  implementing  the  regulatory  offsets  required  by  Executive  Order 
13771,  each  agency  head  should  prioritize,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law, 
those regulations that the agency’s Regulatory Reform Task Force has identi-
fied  as  being  outdated,  unnecessary,  or  ineffective  pursuant  to  subsection 
(d)(ii) of this section. 

(g) Within 90 days of the date of this order, and on a schedule determined 
by  the  agency  head  thereafter,  each  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Force  shall 
provide  a  report  to  the  agency  head  detailing  the  agency’s  progress  toward 
the following goals: 

(i)  improving  implementation  of  regulatory  reform  initiatives  and  policies 
pursuant to section 2 of this order; and 
(ii) identifying regulations for repeal, replacement, or modification. 

Sec.  4.  Accountability.  Consistent  with  the  policy  set  forth  in  section  1 
of  this  order,  each  agency  should  measure  its  progress  in  performing  the 
tasks outlined in section 3 of this order. 

(a)  Agencies  listed  in  section  901(b)(1)  of  title  31,  United  States  Code, 
shall  incorporate  in  their  annual  performance  plans  (required  under  the 
Government  Performance  and  Results  Act,  as  amended  (see  31  U.S.C. 
1115(b))), performance indicators that measure progress toward the two goals 
listed  in  section  3(g)  of  this  order.  Within  60  days  of  the  date  of  this 
order,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (Director)  shall 
issue  guidance  regarding  the  implementation  of  this  subsection.  Such  guid-
ance  may  also  address  how  agencies  not  otherwise  covered  under  this  sub-
section should be held accountable for compliance with this order. 

(b)  The  head  of  each  agency  shall  consider  the  progress  toward  the  two 
goals  listed  in  section  3(g)  of  this  order  in  assessing  the  performance  of 
the  Regulatory  Reform  Task  Force  and,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law, 
those individuals responsible for developing and issuing agency regulations. 
Sec.  5.  Waiver.  Upon  the  request  of  an  agency  head,  the  Director  may 
waive compliance with this order if the Director determines that the agency 
generally  issues  very  few  or  no  regulations  (as  defined  in  section  4  of 
Executive  Order  13771).  The  Director  may  revoke  a  waiver  at  any  time. 
The  Director  shall  publish,  at  least  once  every  3  months,  a  list  of  agencies 
with current waivers.

Executive  Order  13807  of  August  15,  2017 

Establishing  Discipline  and  Accountability  in  the  Environ-
mental  Review  and  Permitting  Process  for  Infrastructure 
Projects 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  ensure  that  the 
Federal  environmental  review  and  permitting  process  for  infrastructure 
projects  is  coordinated,  predictable,  and  transparent,  it  is  hereby  ordered 
as follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  America  needs  increased  infrastructure  investment  to 
strengthen our economy, enhance our competitiveness in world trade, create 
jobs  and  increase  wages  for  our  workers,  and  reduce  the  costs  of  goods 
and services for our families. The poor condition of America’s infrastructure 
has  been  estimated  to  cost  a  typical  American  household  thousands  of 
dollars  each  year.  Inefficiencies  in  current  infrastructure  project  decisions, 
including  management  of  environmental  reviews  and  permit  decisions  or 
authorizations,  have  delayed  infrastructure  investments,  increased  project 
costs,  and  blocked  the  American  people  from  enjoying  improved  infrastruc-
ture  that  would  benefit  our  economy,  society,  and  environment.  More  effi-
cient  and  effective  Federal  infrastructure  decisions  can  transform  our  econ-
omy,  so  the  Federal  Government,  as  a  whole,  must  change  the  way  it 
processes environmental reviews and authorization decisions. 
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the Federal Government to: 

(a) safeguard our communities and maintain a healthy environment; 
(b)  ensure  that  Federal  authorities  make  informed  decisions  concerning 

the environmental impacts of infrastructure projects; 

(c) develop infrastructure in an environmentally sensitive manner; 
(d)  provide  transparency  and  accountability  to  the  public  regarding  envi-

ronmental review and authorization decisions; 

(e)  be  good  stewards  of  public  funds,  including  those  used  to  develop 

infrastructure projects, and avoid duplicative and wasteful processes; 

(f) conduct environmental reviews and authorization processes in a coordi-
nated,  consistent,  predictable,  and  timely  manner  in  order  to  give  public 
and  private  investors  the  confidence  necessary  to  make  funding  decisions 
for new infrastructure projects; 

(g) speak with a coordinated voice when conducting environmental reviews 

and making authorization decisions; and 

(h) make timely decisions with the goal of completing all Federal environ-
mental  reviews  and  authorization  decisions  for  major  infrastructure  projects 
within 2 years. 
Sec.  3.  Definitions.  The  terms  of  this  order  shall  be  applied  consistently 
with  those  defined  under  42  U.S.C.  4370m  and  implementing  guidance 
to the maximum extent possible. The following definitions shall specifically 
apply: 

(a)  ‘‘Authorization’’  means  any  license,  permit,  approval,  finding,  deter-
mination,  or  other  administrative  decision  issued  by  a  Federal  department 
or  agency  (agency)  that  is  required  or  authorized  under  Federal  law  in

order to site, construct, reconstruct, or commence operations of an infrastruc-
ture project, including any authorization under 42 U.S.C. 4370m(3). 

(b)  ‘‘CAP  Goals’’  means  Federal  Government  Priority  Goals  established 
by  the  Government  Performance  and  Results  Act  (GPRA)  Modernization 
Act  of  2010,  Public  Law  111–352,  124  Stat.  3866,  and  commonly  referred 
to as Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals. 

(c) ‘‘Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council’’ or ‘‘FPISC’’ means 

the entity established under 42 U.S.C. 4370m–1. 

(d)  ‘‘Infrastructure  project’’  means  a  project  to  develop  the  public  and 
private  physical  assets  that  are  designed  to  provide  or  support  services 
to the general public in the following sectors: surface transportation, includ-
ing roadways, bridges, railroads, and transit; aviation; ports, including naviga-
tional  channels;  water  resources  projects;  energy  production  and  generation, 
including  from  fossil,  renewable,  nuclear,  and  hydro  sources;  electricity 
transmission; broadband Internet; pipelines; stormwater and sewer infrastruc-
ture;  drinking  water  infrastructure;  and  other  sectors  as  may  be  determined 
by the FPISC. 

(e) ‘‘Major infrastructure project’’ means an infrastructure project for which 
multiple  authorizations  by  Federal  agencies  will  be  required  to  proceed 
with construction, the lead Federal agency has determined that it will prepare 
an  environmental  impact  statement  (EIS)  under  the  National  Environmental 
Policy  Act  (NEPA),  42  U.S.C.  4321  et  seq.,  and  the  project  sponsor  has 
identified  the  reasonable  availability  of  funds  sufficient  to  complete  the 
project. 

(f)  ‘‘Permitting  timetable’’  means  an  environmental  review  and  authoriza-
tion schedule, or other equivalent schedule, for a project or group of projects 
that identifies milestones—including intermediate and final completion dates 
for action by each agency on any Federal environmental review or authoriza-
tion  required  for  a  project  or  group  of  projects—that  is  prepared  by  the 
lead  Federal  agency  in  consultation  with  all  cooperating  and  participating 
agencies. 
Sec.  4.  Agency  Performance  Accountability.  Federal  agencies  should  follow 
transparent and coordinated processes for conducting environmental reviews 
and  making  authorization  decisions.  These  processes  must  include  early 
and  open  coordination  among  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  agencies  and 
early  engagement  with  the  public.  Holding  Federal  agencies  accountable 
for  their  progress  on  implementing  the  policy  set  forth  in  section  2  of 
this  order  should,  among  other  things,  produce  measurably  better  environ-
mental outcomes with respect to infrastructure development. 

(a) Performance Priority Goals. 
(i)  CAP  Goal.  A  CAP  Goal  is  a  Federal  tool  for  accelerating  progress 
in priority areas that require active collaboration among multiple agencies 
to  overcome  organizational  barriers  and  to  achieve  better  performance 
than  one  agency  could  achieve  on  its  own.  Within  180  days  of  the  date 
of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), 
in consultation with the FPISC, shall establish a CAP Goal on Infrastructure 
Permitting Modernization so that, where permitted by law: 

(A) Federal environmental reviews and authorization processes for infra-

structure projects are consistent, coordinated, and predictable; and 

(B)  the  time  for  the  Federal  Government’s  processing  of  environmental 
reviews  and  authorization  decisions  for  new  major  infrastructure  projects 
should  be  reduced  to  not  more  than  an  average  of  approximately  2  years, 
measured  from  the  date  of  the  publication  of  a  notice  of  intent  to  prepare 
an  environmental  impact  statement  or  other  benchmark  deemed  appro-
priate by the Director of OMB. 
(ii) Agency Goals. All Federal agencies with environmental review, author-
ization,  or  consultation  responsibilities  for  infrastructure  projects  shall 
modify  their  Strategic  Plans  and  Annual  Performance  Plans  under  the

GPRA  Modernization  Act  of  2010  to  include  agency  performance  goals 
related  to  the  completion  of  environmental  reviews  and  authorizations 
for infrastructure projects consistent with the new CAP Goal on Infrastruc-
ture  Permitting  Modernization.  The  agencies  shall  integrate  the  achieve-
ment  of  these  performance  goals  into  appropriate  agency  personnel  per-
formance  plans,  such  as  those  of  the  agency  Chief  Environmental  Review 
and Permitting Officers (CERPOs) or other appropriate officials, consistent 
with  guidance  to  be  provided  by  OMB,  in  consultation  with  the  Office 
of  Personnel  Management.  Progress  on  these  goals  shall  be  reviewed  and 
analyzed  by  agency  leadership,  pursuant  to  the  GPRA  Modernization  Act 
of 2010. 
(b)  Accountability.  Within  180  days  of  the  establishment  of  the  CAP  Goal 
on  Infrastructure  Permitting  Modernization,  as  described  in  subsection  (a) 
of  this  section,  or  such  longer  period  of  time  as  determined  by  the  Director 
of  OMB,  OMB,  in  consultation  with  the  FPISC,  shall  issue  guidance  for 
establishing  a  performance  accountability  system  to  facilitate  achievement 
of the CAP Goal. 

(i)  Tracking  of  Major  Infrastructure  Projects.  The  performance  account-
ability  system  shall  track  each  major  infrastructure  project.  The  perform-
ance  accountability  system  shall  include,  at  a  minimum,  assessments  of 
the  agency’s  performance  with  respect  to  each  of  the  following  areas, 
as applicable: 

(A)  whether  major  infrastructure  projects  are  processed  using  the  ‘‘One 
Federal  Decision’’  mechanism,  as  described  in  subsection  5(b)  of  this 
order; 

(B)  whether  major  infrastructure  projects  have  a  permitting  timetable; 
(C)  whether  major  infrastructure  projects  follow  an  effective  process 
that  automatically  elevates  instances  in  which  permitting  timetable  mile-
stones are missed or extended, or are anticipated to be missed or extended, 
to appropriate senior agency officials; 

(D)  whether  agencies  are  meeting  the  established  milestones  in  the  per-

mitting timetable; 

(E) the time it takes to complete the processing of environmental reviews 

and authorizations for each major infrastructure project; and 

(F)  the  costs  of  the  environmental  reviews  and  authorizations  for  each 

major infrastructure project. 
(ii)  Scoring.  The  accountability  system  shall  include  a  scoring  mechanism 
that shall follow, at a minimum, the following procedures: 

(A)  agencies  will  submit  information  to  OMB,  consistent  with  existing 
reporting mechanisms to the maximum extent possible, on the assessment 
areas described in subsection (b)(i) of this section; 

(B)  at  least  once  per  quarter,  OMB  will  produce  a  scorecard  of  agency 

performance and overall progress toward achieving CAP Goal targets; 

(C) where an agency’s inability to meet a permitting timetable milestone 
results  in  a  significant  delay  of  the  project  timeline,  after  consulting  with 
the  project  sponsor  and  relevant  agencies,  agencies  will  submit  (based 
on  OMB  guidance)  an  estimate  of  the  delay’s  costs  to  the  project;  and 
(D) the Director of OMB will consider each agency’s performance during 
budget formulation and determine whether appropriate penalties, including 
those  authorized  at  23  U.S.C.  139(h)(7)  and  33  U.S.C.  2348(h)(5),  must 
or  should  be  imposed,  to  the  extent  required  or  permitted  by  law,  for 
those  that  significantly  fail  to  meet  a  permitting  timetable  milestone  or 
in other situations deemed appropriate by the Director of OMB after consid-
ering the causes of any poor performance. 
(iii) Best Practices. Agencies shall implement the techniques and strategies 
the  FPISC  annually  identifies  as  best  practices  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C. 
4370m–1(c)(2)(B),  as  appropriate.  The  performance  accountability  system

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  163 / Thursday,  August  24,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

shall  track  and  score  agencies  on  the  incorporation  and  implementation 
of  appropriate  best  practices  for  all  infrastructure  projects,  including  the 
implementation of such best practices at an agency’s field level. 

Sec.  5.  Process  Enhancements.  In  furtherance  of  the  policy  described  in 
section 2 of this order, Federal agencies shall follow a more unified environ-
mental review and authorization process. 

(a) Processing of Major Infrastructure Projects. In processing environmental 
reviews and authorizations for major infrastructure projects, Federal agencies 
shall: 

(i) use ‘‘One Federal Decision’’ described in subsection (b) of this section; 
(ii)  develop  and  follow  a  permitting  timetable,  which  shall  be  reviewed 
and  updated  at  least  quarterly  by  the  lead  Federal  agency  in  consultation 
with Federal cooperating and participating agencies; and 
(iii) follow an effective process that automatically elevates instances where 
a  permitting  timetable  milestone  is  missed  or  extended,  or  is  anticipated 
to  be  missed  or  extended,  to  appropriate  senior  agency  officials  of  the 
lead  Federal  agency  and  the  cooperating  and  participating  Federal  agency 
or agencies to which the milestone applies. 
(b) One Federal Decision. 
(i)  Each  major  infrastructure  project  shall  have  a  lead  Federal  agency, 
which  shall  be  responsible  for  navigating  the  project  through  the  Federal 
environmental  review  and  authorization  process,  including  the  identifica-
tion  of  a  primary  Federal  point  of  contact  at  each  Federal  agency.  All 
Federal  cooperating  and  participating  agencies  shall  identify  points  of 
contact  for  each  project,  cooperate  with  the  lead  Federal  agency  point 
of  contact,  and  respond  to  all  reasonable  requests  for  information  from 
the lead Federal agency in a timely manner. 
(ii)  With  respect  to  the  applicability  of  NEPA  to  a  major  infrastructure 
project,  the  Federal  lead,  cooperating,  and  participating  agencies  for  each 
major infrastructure project shall all record any individual agency decision 
in  one  Record  of  Decision  (ROD),  which  shall  be  coordinated  by  the 
lead  Federal  agency  unless  the  project  sponsor  requests  that  agencies 
issue  separate  NEPA  documents,  the  NEPA  obligations  of  a  cooperating 
or  participating  agency  have  already  been  satisfied,  or  the  lead  Federal 
agency  determines  that  a  single  ROD  would  not  best  promote  completion 
of the project’s environmental review and authorization process. The Fed-
eral lead, cooperating, and participating agencies shall all agree to a permit-
ting  timetable  that  includes  the  completion  dates  for  the  ROD  and  the 
federally required authorizations for the project. 
(iii)  All  Federal  authorization  decisions  for  the  construction  of  a  major 
infrastructure  project  shall  be  completed  within  90  days  of  the  issuance 
of a ROD by the lead Federal agency, provided that the final EIS includes 
an  adequate  level  of  detail  to  inform  agency  decisions  pursuant  to  their 
specific  statutory  authority  and  requirements.  The  lead  Federal  agency 
may  extend  the  90-day  deadline  if  the  lead  Federal  agency  determines 
that  Federal  law  prohibits  the  agency  from  issuing  its  approval  or  permit 
within  the  90-day  period,  the  project  sponsor  requests  that  the  permit 
or  approval  follow  a  different  timeline,  or  the  lead  Federal  agency  deter-
mines  that  an  extension  would  better  promote  completion  of  the  project’s 
environmental review and authorization process. 
(iv) The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) and OMB shall develop 
the  framework  for  implementing  One  Federal  Decision,  in  consultation 
with the FPISC. 

(A) The framework should be consistent with the model processes estab-
lished  under  42  U.S.C.  4370m–2,  23  U.S.C.  139,  33  U.S.C.  2348,  the 
2015  ‘‘Red  Book’’  (officially  entitled  ‘‘Synchronizing  Environmental  Re-
views  for  Transportation  and  Other  Infrastructure  Projects’’),  and  CEQ 
guidance  on  efficient  and  timely  environmental  reviews  under  NEPA.

40467 

(B)  The  framework  shall  also  include  guidance  on  the  development 
of  permitting  timetables  by  the  lead  Federal  agencies,  in  collaboration 
with Federal cooperating and participating agencies. Permitting timetables 
shall  identify  estimated  intermediate  and  final  completion  dates  for  all 
environmental  reviews  and  authorizations  that  are  reasonably  anticipated 
as being needed for a project, including the process for granting extensions 
of  any  established  dates.  The  guidance  shall  specify  that  lead  Federal 
agencies need not include the estimated intermediate and final completion 
dates  of  any  such  reviews  or  authorizations  until  the  design  of  a  project 
has  sufficiently  advanced  so  that  they  can  be  developed.  In  such  cases, 
the  guidance  shall  instruct  lead  Federal  agencies  to  estimate  when  the 
project’s  design  will  be  advanced  enough  to  determine  such  dates.  The 
timelines  shall  account  for  any  federally  required  decisions  or  permits 
that  are  assumed  by,  or  delegated  to,  State,  tribal,  or  local  agencies  and 
the  extent  to  which  any  approval  or  permit  to  be  issued  by  a  Federal 
agency  is  dependent  upon  the  issuance  of  such  a  decision  or  permit. 
(C) CEQ and OMB shall also develop guidance for applying One Federal 
Decision  whenever  the  lead  agency  is  a  State,  tribal,  or  local  agency 
exercising  an  assignment  or  delegation  of  an  agency’s  NEPA  responsibil-
ities. 
(c) Dashboard. All projects subject to 23 U.S.C. 139 and ‘‘covered projects’’ 
under 42 U.S.C. 4370m shall be tracked on the Dashboard established under 
42 U.S.C. 4370m–2(b). Other projects or classes of projects subject to special 
environmental  review  and  authorization  streamlining  processes  similar  to 
those  referenced  in  this  subsection  may  also  be  tracked  on  the  Dashboard 
at  the  discretion  of  the  FPISC  Executive  Director.  The  dates  for  milestones 
of  all  projects  tracked  on  the  Dashboard  shall  be  updated  monthly,  or  on 
another  appropriate  timeline  as  may  be  determined  by  the  FPISC  Executive 
Director. 

(d) Executive Order 13766. For purposes of implementing Executive Order 
13766 of January 24, 2017 (Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals 
for High Priority Infrastructure Projects), all infrastructure projects that meet 
the  criteria  for,  and  are  subject  to,  23  U.S.C.  139,  33  U.S.C.  2348,  or  42 
U.S.C. 4370m–4370m–12 shall qualify as high priority projects under Execu-
tive  Order  13766.  Other  projects  or  classes  of  projects  subject  to  special 
environmental  review  and  authorization  streamlining  processes,  similar  to 
those  referenced  in  this  subsection  as  may  be  determined  by  the  FPISC 
Executive  Director  in  consultation  with  OMB  and  CEQ,  shall  also  qualify 
as  high  priority  infrastructure  projects  under  Executive  Order  13766.  The 
CEQ  Chairman’s  responsibilities  under  sections  2  and  3  of  Executive  Order 
13766  shall  be  satisfied  by  referring  the  project  to  the  FPISC  Executive 
Director,  the  Secretary  of  Transportation,  or  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the 
Army for Civil Works, as appropriate. 

(e) Council on Environmental Quality. 
(i)  Directives.  Within  30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  CEQ  shall 
develop  an  initial  list  of  actions  it  will  take  to  enhance  and  modernize 
the Federal environmental review and authorization process. Such actions 
should  include  issuing  such  regulations,  guidance,  and  directives  as  CEQ 
may deem necessary to: 

(A)  ensure  optimal  interagency  coordination  of  environmental  review 
and  authorization  decisions,  including  by  providing  for  an  expanded  role 
and  authorities  for  lead  agencies,  more  clearly  defined  responsibilities 
for  cooperating  and  participating  agencies,  and  Government-wide  applica-
bility of NEPA decisions and analyses; 

(B)  ensure  that  environmental  reviews  and  authorization  decisions  in-
volving  multiple  agencies  are  conducted  in  a  manner  that  is  concurrent, 
synchronized, timely, and efficient; 

(C)  provide  for  agency  use,  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law, 
of  environmental  studies,  analysis,  and  decisions  conducted  in  support

of earlier Federal, State, tribal, or local environmental reviews or authoriza-
tion decisions; and 

(D) ensure that agencies apply NEPA in a manner that reduces unneces-
sary  burdens  and  delays  as  much  as  possible,  including  by  using  CEQ’s 
authority  to  interpret  NEPA  to  simplify  and  accelerate  the  NEPA  review 
process. 
(ii)  Dispute  Resolution.  Except  where  dispute  resolution  processes  are 
otherwise  provided  for  in  law,  including  under  42  U.S.C.  4370m–2,  or 
by  Executive  Order  or  other  Presidential  directive,  upon  request  of  a 
lead  Federal  agency,  cooperating  agency,  or  participating  agency,  CEQ 
may  mediate  interagency  disputes  arising  between  Federal  agencies  con-
cerning  Federal  environmental  review  or  authorization  decisions  for  any 
infrastructure project pertaining to any environmental law, regulation, order 
or  policy,  and  shall  facilitate  resolution  of  any  conflicting  positions  of 
the relevant agencies. 
(iii)  Agency  Procedures.  CEQ  shall  form  and  lead  an  interagency  working 
group, consisting of the Director of OMB, agency CERPOs, and such other 
representatives of agencies as CEQ deems appropriate. The working group 
shall review the NEPA implementing regulations and other environmental 
review and authorization processing policies of agencies that are members 
of  the  FPISC  to  identify  impediments  to  efficient  and  effective  environ-
mental reviews and authorizations for infrastructure projects. The working 
group  shall  also  identify  those  agencies  that  require  an  action  plan  to 
address  identified  impediments.  Based  on  this  review,  agencies  shall  de-
velop  action  plans  that  set  forth  the  actions  they  will  take  and  timelines 
for  completing  those  actions,  and  they  shall  submit  those  action  plans 
to  CEQ  and  OMB  for  comment.  Each  agency’s  action  plan  shall,  at  a 
minimum, establish procedures for a regular review and update of categor-
ical exclusions, where appropriate. 
(f) Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council. 
(i)  Organizational  Support.  Unless  otherwise  determined  by  the  Director 
of OMB, the General Services Administration (GSA) shall provide necessary 
administrative  and  organizational  support  to  the  FPISC,  including  per-
sonnel,  procurement,  and  budget  support.  The  GSA  Administrator,  or 
the  head  of  another  agency  designated  by  the  Director  of  OMB,  may 
delegate  any  authority  to  the  FPISC  Executive  Director  necessary  for  the 
operation and administration of the FPISC and the Office of the Executive 
Director,  and  the  Executive  Director  may  redelegate  these  authorities,  as 
appropriate. 
(ii) Additional Duties. In addition to the duties and responsibilities charged 
to  the  FPISC  Executive  Director  under  42  U.S.C.  4370m–4370m–12  and 
this  order,  the  FPISC  Executive  Director  may,  upon  request  of  a  FPISC 
member  agency  or  a  project  sponsor,  work  with  the  lead  agency  or  any 
cooperating  and  participating  agencies  to  facilitate  the  environmental  re-
view  and  authorization  process  for  any  infrastructure  project  regardless 
of  whether  the  project  is  a  ‘‘covered  project’’  under  42  U.S.C.  4370m, 
including  by  resolving  disputes  and  promoting  early  coordination.  The 
FPISC  Executive  Director,  the  Director  of  OMB,  or  the  Chairman  of  CEQ 
may establish any appropriate policies or procedures concerning the FPISC 
Executive Director’s facilitation of the environmental review and authoriza-
tion  process  under  this  subsection.  Agencies  must  cooperate  with  the 
FPISC  Executive  Director  with  respect  to  the  implementation  of  these 
additional duties. 
(g)  Energy  Corridors.  The  Departments  of  the  Interior  and  Agriculture, 
as  appropriate,  shall  be  the  lead  agencies  for  facilitating  the  identification 
and designation of energy right-of-way corridors on Federal lands for Govern-
ment-wide  expedited  environmental  review  for  the  development  of  energy 
infrastructure projects. 

(h)  The  Department  of  the  Interior  shall  provide  to  OMB  a  strategy  and 
recommendations for a multi-agency reorganization effort that would further

Notice  of  May  16,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Stabilization  of  Iraq 

On  May  22,  2003,  by  Executive  Order  13303,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Pow-
ers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  posed 
by obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and mainte-
nance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq. 

The obstacles to the orderly reconstruction of Iraq, the restoration and mainte-
nance of peace and security in the country, and the development of political, 
administrative, and economic institutions in Iraq continue to pose an unusual 
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the 
United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order  13303,  as  modified  in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps 
taken  in  Executive  Order  13315  of  August  28,  2003,  Executive  Order  13350 
of  July  29,  2004,  Executive  Order  13364  of  November  29,  2004,  Executive 
Order  13438  of  July  17,  2007,  and  Executive  Order  13668  of  May  27,  2014, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  May  22,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the 
stabilization of Iraq declared in Executive Order 13303. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Presidential Documents

Order  of  September  13,  2017 

Regarding  the  Proposed  Acquisition  of  Lattice  Semiconductor 
Corporation  by  China  Venture  Capital  Fund  Corporation 
Limited 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  section  721  of  the  Defense 
Production  Act  of  1950,  as  amended  (section  721),  50  U.S.C.  4565,  it  is 
hereby ordered as follows: 

Section  1.  Findings.  (a)  There  is  credible  evidence  that  leads  me  to  believe 
that  (1)  Canyon  Bridge  Merger  Sub,  Inc.,  a  corporation  organized  under 
the  laws  of  Delaware  (Merger  Sub);  (2)  Merger  Sub’s  parent  companies 
Canyon  Bridge  Acquisition  Company,  Inc.,  a  corporation  organized  under 
the  laws  of  Delaware  (Acquisition  Company),  Canyon  Bridge  Capital  Invest-
ment  Limited,  an  entity  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  Cayman  Islands 
(Capital Investment), and Canyon Bridge Fund I, LP (CBFI), a limited partner-
ship  organized  under  the  laws  of  Delaware;  and  (3)  CBFI’s  limited  partner 
Yitai  Capital  Limited,  a  company  organized  under  the  laws  of  Hong  Kong 
(Yitai), and Yitai’s parent company China Venture Capital Fund Corporation 
Limited,  a  corporation  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  People’s  Republic 
of China (CVCF and, together with Merger Sub, Acquisition Company, Capital 
Investment,  CBFI,  and  Yitai,  the  Purchasers),  through  exercising  control 
of  Lattice  Semiconductor  Corporation,  a  corporation  organized  under  the 
laws  of  Delaware  (Lattice),  might  take  action  that  threatens  to  impair  the 
national security of the United States; and 

(b)  Provisions  of  law,  other  than  section  721  and  the  International  Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), do not, in my judgment, 
provide  adequate  and  appropriate  authority  for  me  to  protect  the  national

Notice  of  July  28,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Leb-
anon 

On  August  1,  2007,  in  Executive  Order  13441,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  with  respect  to  Lebanon  pursuant  to  the  International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions  of  certain  persons  to  under-
mine Lebanon’s legitimate and democratically elected government and demo-
cratic  institutions;  contribute  to  the  deliberate  breakdown  in  the  rule  of 
law in Lebanon, including through politically motivated violence and intimi-
dation; reassert Syrian control or contribute to Syrian interference in Lebanon; 
or infringe upon or undermine Lebanese sovereignty. These actions contribute 
to political and economic instability in Lebanon and the region. 
Certain  ongoing  activities,  such  as  continuing  arms  transfers  to  Hizballah 
that include increasingly sophisticated weapons systems, serve to undermine 
Lebanese  sovereignty,  contribute  to  political  and  economic  instability  in 
Lebanon,  and  continue  to  constitute  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on August 1, 2007, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  August  1,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of 
the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1 
year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  Lebanon  declared  in  Executive 
Order 13441. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

30,  2016,  UNSCR  2356  of  June  2,  2017,  UNSCR  2371  of  August  5,  2017, 
and  UNSCR  2375  of  September  11,  2017,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President 
of the United States of America, find that: 
The  provocative,  destabilizing,  and  repressive  actions  and  policies  of  the 
Government  of  North  Korea,  including  its  intercontinental  ballistic  missile 
launches  of  July  3  and  July  28,  2017,  and  its  nuclear  test  of  September 
2,  2017,  each  of  which  violated  its  obligations  under  numerous  UNSCRs 
and contravened its commitments under the September 19, 2005, Joint State-
ment of the Six-Party Talks; its commission of serious human rights abuses; 
and  its  use  of  funds  generated  through  international  trade  to  support  its 
nuclear  and  missile  programs  and  weapons  proliferation,  constitute  a  con-
tinuing  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the 
United  States,  and  a  disturbance  of  the  international  relations  of  the  United 
States. 
In order to take further steps with respect to the national emergency declared 
in  Executive  Order  13466  of  June  26,  2008,  as  modified  in  scope  by  and 
relied  upon  for  additional  steps  in  subsequent  Executive  Orders,  I  hereby 
find, determine, and order: 
Section  1.  (a)  All  property  and  interests  in  property  that  are  in  the  United 
States,  that  hereafter  come  within  the  United  States,  or  that  are  or  hereafter

following  persons  are  blocked  and  may  not  be  transferred,  paid,  exported, 
withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: 
Any  person  determined  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation

(iv)  to  be  a  North  Korean  person,  including  a  North  Korean  person  that

ment of North Korea or the Workers’ Party of Korea; 
(v)  to  have  materially  assisted,  sponsored,  or  provided  financial,  material,

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  184 / Monday,  September  25,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

Sec. 8. For the purposes of this order: 

(a) the term ‘‘person’’ means an individual or entity; 
(b) the term ‘‘entity’’ means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, 

corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; 

(c)  the  term  ‘‘United  States  person’’  means  any  United  States  citizen, 
permanent  resident  alien,  entity  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United 
States  or  any  jurisdiction  within  the  United  States  (including  foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States; 

(d)  the  term  ‘‘North  Korean  person’’  means  any  North  Korean  citizen, 
North  Korean  permanent  resident  alien,  or  entity  organized  under  the  laws 
of  North  Korea  or  any  jurisdiction  within  North  Korea  (including  foreign 
branches).  For  the  purposes  of  section  1  of  this  order,  the  term  ‘‘North 
Korean  person’’  shall  not  include  any  United  States  citizen,  any  permanent 
resident alien of the United States, any alien lawfully admitted to the United 
States, or any alien holding a valid United States visa; 

(e)  the  term  ‘‘foreign  financial  institution’’  means  any  foreign  entity  that 
is  engaged  in  the  business  of  accepting  deposits,  making,  granting,  transfer-
ring,  holding,  or  brokering  loans  or  credits,  or  purchasing  or  selling  foreign 
exchange,  securities,  commodity  futures  or  options,  or  procuring  purchasers 
and  sellers  thereof,  as  principal  or  agent.  The  term  includes,  among  other 
entities,  depository  institutions;  banks;  savings  banks;  money  service  busi-
nesses;  trust  companies;  securities  brokers  and  dealers;  commodity  futures 
and  options  brokers  and  dealers;  forward  contract  and  foreign  exchange 
merchants;  securities  and  commodities  exchanges;  clearing  corporations;  in-
vestment  companies;  employee  benefit  plans;  dealers  in  precious  metals, 
stones,  or  jewels;  and  holding  companies,  affiliates,  or  subsidiaries  of  any 
of the foregoing. The term does not include the international financial institu-
tions identified in 22 U.S.C. 262r(c)(2), the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development,  the  North  American  Development  Bank,  or  any  other  inter-
national  financial  institution  so  notified  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury; 
and 

(f)  the  term  ‘‘knowingly,’’  with  respect  to  conduct,  a  circumstance,  or 
a  result,  means  that  a  person  has  actual  knowledge,  or  should  have  known, 
of the conduct, the circumstance, or the result. 
Sec.  9.  For  those  persons  whose  property  and  interests  in  property  are 
blocked  pursuant  to  this  order  who  might  have  a  constitutional  presence 
in  the  United  States,  I  find  that  because  of  the  ability  to  transfer  funds 
or  other  assets  instantaneously,  prior  notice  to  such  persons  of  measures 
to  be  taken  pursuant  to  this  order  would  render  those  measures  ineffectual. 
I  therefore  determine  that  for  these  measures  to  be  effective  in  addressing 
the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466,  there  need  be 
no  prior  notice  of  a  listing  or  determination  made  pursuant  to  this  order. 
Sec.  10.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary 
of  State,  is  hereby  authorized  to  take  such  actions,  including  adopting  rules 
and  regulations,  and  to  employ  all  powers  granted  to  me  by  IEEPA  and 
UNPA  as  may  be  necessary  to  implement  this  order.  The  Secretary  of  the 
Treasury  may,  consistent  with  applicable  law,  redelegate  any  of  these  func-
tions  to  other  officers  and  agencies  of  the  United  States.  All  agencies  shall 
take all appropriate measures within their authority to implement this order. 
Sec.  11.  This  order  is  effective  at  12:01  a.m.,  Eastern  Daylight  Time,  Sep-
tember 21, 2017.

Executive  Order  13765  of  January  20,  2017 

Minimizing  the  Economic  Burden  of  the  Patient  Protection 
and  Affordable  Care  Act  Pending  Repeal 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 

Section  1.  It  is  the  policy  of  my  Administration  to  seek  the  prompt  repeal 
of  the  Patient  Protection  and  Affordable  Care  Act  (Public  Law  111–148), 
as amended (the ‘‘Act’’). In the meantime, pending such repeal, it is impera-
tive  for  the  executive  branch  to  ensure  that  the  law  is  being  efficiently 
implemented,  take  all  actions  consistent  with  law  to  minimize  the  unwar-
ranted  economic  and  regulatory  burdens  of  the  Act,  and  prepare  to  afford 
the  States  more  flexibility  and  control  to  create  a  more  free  and  open 
healthcare market. 

Sec.  2.  To  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Secretary  of  Health 
and Human Services (Secretary) and the heads of all other executive depart-
ments  and  agencies  (agencies)  with  authorities  and  responsibilities  under 
the  Act  shall  exercise  all  authority  and  discretion  available  to  them  to 
waive,  defer,  grant  exemptions  from,  or  delay  the  implementation  of  any 
provision  or  requirement  of  the  Act  that  would  impose  a  fiscal  burden 
on any State or a cost, fee, tax, penalty, or regulatory burden on individuals, 
families,  healthcare  providers,  health  insurers,  patients,  recipients  of 
healthcare  services,  purchasers  of  health  insurance,  or  makers  of  medical 
devices, products, or medications. 

Sec.  3.  To  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Secretary  and  the 
heads  of  all  other  executive  departments  and  agencies  with  authorities  and 
responsibilities  under  the  Act,  shall  exercise  all  authority  and  discretion 
available  to  them  to  provide  greater  flexibility  to  States  and  cooperate  with 
them in implementing healthcare programs. 

Sec. 4. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the head of each department 
or  agency  with  responsibilities  relating  to  healthcare  or  health  insurance 
shall  encourage  the  development  of  a  free  and  open  market  in  interstate 
commerce  for  the  offering  of  healthcare  services  and  health  insurance,  with 
the  goal  of  achieving  and  preserving  maximum  options  for  patients  and 
consumers. 

Sec.  5.  To  the  extent  that  carrying  out  the  directives  in  this  order  would 
require  revision  of  regulations  issued  through  notice-and-comment  rule-
making,  the  heads  of  agencies  shall  comply  with  the  Administrative  Proce-
dure  Act  and  other  applicable  statutes  in  considering  or  promulgating  such 
regulatory revisions. 

Sec.  6.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed  to  impair  or  otherwise 
affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 

(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13798  of  May  4,  2017 

Promoting  Free  Speech  and  Religious  Liberty 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, in order to guide the executive branch 
in formulating and implementing policies with implications for the religious 
liberty  of  persons  and  organizations  in  America,  and  to  further  compliance 
with the Constitution and with applicable statutes and Presidential Directives, 
it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously 
enforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom. The Founders 
envisioned  a  Nation  in  which  religious  voices  and  views  were  integral 
to  a  vibrant  public  square,  and  in  which  religious  people  and  institutions 
were  free  to  practice  their  faith  without  fear  of  discrimination  or  retaliation 
by  the  Federal  Government.  For  that  reason,  the  United  States  Constitution 
enshrines  and  protects  the  fundamental  right  to  religious  liberty  as  Ameri-
cans’  first  freedom.  Federal  law  protects  the  freedom  of  Americans  and 
their  organizations  to  exercise  religion  and  participate  fully  in  civic  life 
without undue interference by the Federal Government. The executive branch 
will honor and enforce those protections. 
Sec. 2. Respecting Religious and Political Speech. All executive departments 
and  agencies  (agencies)  shall,  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  and  to  the 
extent  permitted  by  law,  respect  and  protect  the  freedom  of  persons  and 
organizations  to  engage  in  religious  and  political  speech.  In  particular,  the 
Secretary  of  the  Treasury  shall  ensure,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law, 
that the Department of the Treasury does not take any adverse action against 
any  individual,  house  of  worship,  or  other  religious  organization  on  the 
basis that such individual or organization speaks or has spoken about moral 
or  political  issues  from  a  religious  perspective,  where  speech  of  similar 
character has, consistent with law, not ordinarily been treated as participation 
or  intervention  in  a  political  campaign  on  behalf  of  (or  in  opposition  to) 
a  candidate  for  public  office  by  the  Department  of  the  Treasury.  As  used 
in  this  section,  the  term  ‘‘adverse  action’’  means  the  imposition  of  any 
tax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance 
of  tax  deductions  for  contributions  made  to  entities  exempted  from  taxation 
under  section  501(c)(3)  of  title  26,  United  States  Code;  or  any  other  action 
that  makes  unavailable  or  denies  any  tax  deduction,  exemption,  credit,  or 
benefit. 
Sec.  3.  Conscience  Protections  with  Respect  to  Preventive-Care  Mandate. 
The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  the  Secretary  of  Labor,  and  the  Secretary 
of  Health  and  Human  Services  shall  consider  issuing  amended  regulations, 
consistent  with  applicable  law,  to  address  conscience-based  objections  to 
the  preventive-care  mandate  promulgated  under  section  300gg–13(a)(4)  of 
title 42, United States Code. 
Sec. 4. Religious Liberty Guidance. In order to guide all agencies in complying 
with  relevant  Federal  law,  the  Attorney  General  shall,  as  appropriate,  issue 
guidance interpreting religious liberty protections in Federal law. 
Sec.  5.  Severability.  If  any  provision  of  this  order,  or  the  application  of 
any  provision  to  any  individual  or  circumstance,  is  held  to  be  invalid, 
the  remainder  of  this  order  and  the  application  of  its  other  provisions 
to  any  other  individuals  or  circumstances  shall  not  be  affected  thereby.

17095 

Notice  of  April  6,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  So-
malia 

On  April  12,  2010,  by  Executive  Order  13536,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to 
the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence 
in Somalia, acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, 
which  have  repeatedly  been  the  subject  of  United  Nations  Security  Council 
resolutions,  and  violations  of  the  arms  embargo  imposed  by  the  United 
Nations Security Council. 
On  July  20,  2012,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13620  to  take  addi-
tional  steps  to  deal  with  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order  13536  in  view  of  United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolution  2036 
of  February  22,  2012,  and  Resolution  2002  of  July  29,  2011,  and  to  address: 
exports  of  charcoal  from  Somalia,  which  generate  significant  revenue  for 
al-Shabaab;  the  misappropriation  of  Somali  public  assets;  and  certain  acts 
of  violence  committed  against  civilians  in  Somalia—all  of  which  contribute 
to  the  deterioration  of  the  security  situation  and  the  persistence  of  violence 
in Somalia. 
The  situation  with  respect  to  Somalia  continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United 
States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  April  12,  2010, 
and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date  and  on  July  20,  2012,  to  deal 
with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  April  12,  2017.  There-
fore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency 
declared in Executive Order 13536.

Notice  of  March  22,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
South  Sudan 

On April 3, 2014, by Executive Order 13664, the President declared a national 
emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by  the  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  South  Sudan,  which  has  been  marked 
by  activities  that  threaten  the  peace,  security,  or  stability  of  South  Sudan 
and  the  surrounding  region,  including  widespread  violence  and  atrocities, 
human rights abuses, recruitment and use of child soldiers, attacks on peace-
keepers  and  humanitarian  workers,  and  obstruction  of  humanitarian  oper-
ations. 
The  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  South  Sudan  continues  to  pose  an 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on

Proclamation  9618  of  May  31,  2017 

African-American  Music  Appreciation  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  June,  we  pay  tribute  to  the  contributions  African  Americans  have 
made  and  continue  to  make  to  American  music.  The  indelible  legacy  of 
these  musicians—who  have  witnessed  our  Nation’s  greatest  achievements, 
as  well  as  its  greatest  injustices—give  all  Americans  a  richer,  deeper  under-
standing  of  American  culture.  Their  creativity  has  shaped  every  genre  of 
music,  including  rock  and  roll,  rhythm  and  blues,  jazz,  gospel,  hip  hop, 
and rap. 
In  March,  rock  and  roll  lost  Chuck  Berry,  one  of  its  founding  fathers. 
Berry’s  signature  style  on  the  guitar,  on  display  in  classics  like  ‘‘Johnny 
B.  Goode,’’  ‘‘Roll  Over  Beethoven,’’  ‘‘Maybellene,’’  and  ‘‘Carol,’’  came  to 
define the explosive new sound of rock and roll. As Keith Richards, guitarist 
for  the  Rolling  Stones  said  while  introducing  Berry  into  the  Rock  and 
Roll Hall of Fame: ‘‘This is the gentleman who started it all.’’ 
We  also  take  time  this  month  to  recognize  the  musical  influence  of  two 
of the greatest jazz musicians of all time, Dizzy Gillespie and Ella Fitzgerald, 
as this year marks their centennial birthdays. Gillespie, through his legendary 
trumpet  sound  and  Fitzgerald,  through  her  pure,  energetic  voice,  treated 
people  around  the  world  to  spirited  and  soulful  jazz  music.  Their  work 
has influenced countless musicians, and continues to inspire listeners young 
and old. 
The contributions of Berry, Gillespie, Fitzgerald, and other African-American 
musicians  shine  as  examples  of  how  music  can  bring  us  together.  These 
musicians  also  remind  us  of  our  humanity  and  of  our  power  to  overcome. 
They  expressed  the  soul  of  blues,  gospel,  and  rock  and  roll,  which  has 
so often captured the hardships of racism and injustices suffered by African 
Americans,  as  well  as  daily  joys  and  celebrations.  Their  work  highlights 
the  power  music  has  to  channel  the  human  experience,  and  they  remain 
a  testament  to  the  resilience  of  all  freedom-loving  people.  We  are  grateful 
for their contribution to the cannon of great American art. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as African- 
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate 
activities  and  programs  that  raise  awareness  and  appreciation  of  African- 
American Music.

Proclamation  9574  of  March  1,  2017 

American  Red  Cross  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  more  than  135  years,  the  American  Red  Cross  has  stepped  into  the 
breach,  providing  shelter,  food,  and  emotional  support  to  victims  of  natural 
disaster,  war,  conflict,  and  unexpected  hardship.  Today,  the  Red  Cross  is 
responsible for a remarkable 40 percent of our Nation’s blood supply, teaches 
life-saving  techniques  to  volunteer  citizen-rescuers,  and  leads  the  world 
in  international  humanitarian  aid.  The  Red  Cross  has  proudly  and  ardently 
supported  our  military,  our  veterans,  and  their  families  for  more  than  a 
century,  delivering  over  352,000  services  to  members  of  the  military  and 
veterans each year. 
The  American  Red  Cross  is  a  miracle-working  organization,  rooted  in  the 
legacy of its gallant founder, Clara Barton, who tore down every convention 
at  the  time  regarding  women  in  battle,  giving  history  one  of  the  most 
incredible examples of courage and devotion to duty that it has ever known. 
Her  tremendous  legacy  lives  on  through  the  Red  Cross’s  assistance  to  hun-
dreds  of  thousands  of  Americans  affected  by  disasters  each  year.  In  2016, 
volunteers responded to 180 significant incidents, including wildfires, storms, 
flooding,  Hurricane  Matthew,  and  other  emergencies  at  all  times  of  the 
day  and  night.  They  opened  nearly  800  emergency  shelters,  served  more 
than  4.1  million  meals  and  snacks,  and  distributed  more  than  2.1  million 
relief  items.  Last  year,  the  Red  Cross  helped  79,000  families  recover  from 
home fires that left them with no place to go. 
The  comfort,  care,  and  relief  provided  by  the  American  Red  Cross  serves 
a  great  mission.  When  those  in  need  see  that  recognizable  symbol  of  hope, 
the  Red  Cross,  they  see  the  hearts  of  the  American  people  at  work—an 
incredibly  powerful  thing.  When  they  see  that  beacon,  they  know  that  true 
help  is  on  the  way,  and  they  feel  our  people’s  mighty  generosity,  love, 
and support for their fellow human beings. 
To  perform  its  vital  national  and  international  roles,  the  Red  Cross  relies 
on  volunteers  and  the  support  of  the  American  people.  The  Red  Cross 
needs our continued commitment of time, resources, and funds to be success-
ful, and our country and the world need the Red Cross. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Donald  J.  Trump,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America  and  Honorary  Chairman  of  the  American  Red  Cross,  by  virtue 
of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the 
United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2017  as  American  Red  Cross 
Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month  with  appropriate 
programs,  ceremonies,  and  activities,  and  by  supporting  the  work  of  service 
and relief organizations.

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9615  of  May  19,  2017 

Armed  Forces  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  almost  70  years,  our  Nation  has  set  aside  one  day  to  recognize  the 
great  debt  we  owe  to  the  men  and  women  who  serve  in  the  Army,  Navy, 
Air  Force,  Marine  Corps,  and  Coast  Guard.  On  Armed  Forces  Day,  we 
salute  the  bravery  of  those  who  defend  our  Nation’s  peace  and  security. 
Their  service  defends  for  Americans  the  freedom  that  all  people  deserve. 
This  year,  we  also  reflect  on  the  100th  anniversary  of  our  Nation’s  entry 
into  World  War  I.  More  than  4.7  million  Americans  would  ultimately  serve 
in the United States Armed Forces during that terrible conflict. Their sacrifice 
has  not  been  forgotten.  One  hundred  years  later,  we  face  different  threats 
and  challenges.  But  our  safety  and  security,  and  the  defense  of  our  way 
of life, rest in the same able hands of our Armed Forces. 
Because our Armed Forces must constantly adapt to new threats, our Nation 
is  committed  to  ensuring  they  have  the  tools  and  resources  they  need  as 
they  train,  deploy,  and  fight  in  defense  of  our  country  and  defending  our 
values.  This  is  why  my  budget  calls  for  a  $54  billion  increase  in  national 
defense spending. 
Today,  we  salute  our  Soldiers,  Sailors,  Airmen,  Marines,  and  Coast  Guards-
men for their dedication as they carry out the extraordinary duty of protecting 
our  country.  We  also  pay  tribute  to  the  families  who  serve  alongside  them, 
lending their steadfast love and support. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  and  Commander  in  Chief  of  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United 
States,  continuing  the  tradition  of  my  predecessors  in  office,  do  hereby 
proclaim the third Saturday of each May as Armed Forces Day. 
I  invite  the  Governors  of  the  States  and  Territories  and  other  areas  subject 
to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  to  provide  for  the  observance  of 
Armed  Forces  Day  within  their  jurisdiction  each  year  in  an  appropriate 
manner  designed  to  increase  public  understanding  and  appreciation  of  the 
Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States.  I  also  invite  veterans,  civic,  and  other 
organizations  to  join  in  the  observance  of  Armed  Forces  Day  each  year. 
Finally,  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States 
at  their  homes  and  businesses  on  Armed  Forces  Day,  and  I  urge  citizens 
to  learn  more  about  military  service  by  attending  and  participating  in  the 
local observances of the day. 
Proclamation 9452 of May 20, 2016, is hereby superseded.

Proclamation  9626  of  July  14,  2017 

Captive  Nations  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  Captive  Nations  Week,  we  stand  in  solidarity  with  those  living 
under repressive regimes, and we commit to promoting our American ideals, 
grounded  in  respect  for  natural  rights  and  protected  by  the  rule  of  law, 
throughout  the  world.  As  President  Reagan  often  reminded  us,  as  a  shining 
city  upon  a  hill,  America  has  a  duty  to  shine  its  beacon  light  on  freedom- 
loving people around the world. 
President  Eisenhower  first  proclaimed  Captive  Nations  Week  during  the 
Cold  War  with  the  Soviet  Union,  promising  that  America  would  stand 
with  those  people  in  captive  nations  who  seek  ‘‘freedom  and  national  inde-
pendence.’’  The  Soviet  Union  collapsed  more  than  a  quarter  of  a  century 
ago,  but  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  around  the  world  still  live  under 
the tyranny of authoritarian regimes. Authoritarianism and its many injustices 
have  wrought  misery  and  held  captive  the  dreams  of  generations,  while 
nations  that  value  liberty  have  prospered  and  empowered  their  citizens 
to pursue their God-given potential to the fullest. 
The  injustices  and  abuses  authoritarian  regimes  inflict  on  their  own  people 
affect  us  all,  and  we  must  recognize  the  bond  we  share  with  those  who 
long  to  be  free  from  oppression.  Throughout  our  Nation’s  history,  brave 
Americans  have 
those  suffering  under 
authoritarianism.  These  American  service  members  have  shined  light  in 
the darkest corners of the world, those that are marred by starvation, political 
imprisonment,  religious  intolerance,  and  many  other  civil  rights  abuses. 
Our  military  and  diplomatic  experiences  have  taught  us  that  freedom  is 
a  powerful,  yet  fragile  force  that  must  be  tirelessly  protected.  We  continue 
to encourage despotic regimes to turn away from their oppressive ideologies 
and  embrace  a  more  hopeful  and  prosperous  future  for  their  people.  This 
week,  and  always,  we  stand  with  all  people  throughout  the  world  who 
are fighting for liberty, justice, and the rule of law. 
The  Congress,  by  Joint  Resolution  approved  July  17,  1959  (73  Stat.  212), 
has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to  issue  a  proclamation  desig-
nating  the  third  week  of  July  of  each  year  as  ‘‘Captive  Nations  Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  July  16  through 
July 22, 2017, as Captive Nations Week. I call upon all Americans to reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  those  around  the  world  striving  for  liberty,  justice, 
and the rule of law.

Proclamation  9656  of  October  6,  2017 

Columbus  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Five  hundred  and  twenty-five  years  ago,  Christopher  Columbus  completed 
an  ambitious  and  daring  voyage  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean  to  the  Americas. 
The voyage was a remarkable and then-unparalleled feat that helped launch 
the  age  of  exploration  and  discovery.  The  permanent  arrival  of  Europeans 
to  the  Americas  was  a  transformative  event  that  undeniably  and  fundamen-
tally changed the course of human history and set the stage for the develop-
ment of our great Nation. Therefore, on Columbus Day, we honor the skilled 
navigator and man of faith, whose courageous feat brought together continents 
and  has  inspired  countless  others  to  pursue  their  dreams  and  convictions— 
even in the face of extreme doubt and tremendous adversity. 
More than five centuries after his initial voyage, we remember the ‘‘Admiral 
of  the  Ocean  Sea’’  for  building  the  critical  first  link  in  the  strong  and 
enduring  bond  between  the  United  States  and  Europe.  While  Isabella  I 
and  Ferdinand  II  of  Spain  sponsored  his  historic  voyage,  Columbus  was 
a  native  of  the  City  of  Genoa,  in  present  day  Italy,  and  represents  the 
rich history of important Italian American contributions to our great Nation. 
There can be no doubt that American culture, business, and civic life would 
all  be  much  less  vibrant  in  the  absence  of  the  Italian  American  community. 
We  also  take  this  opportunity  to  reaffirm  our  close  ties  to  Columbus’s 
country of birth, Italy. Italy is a strong ally and a valued partner in promoting 
peace and promoting prosperity around the world. 
In commemoration of Christopher Columbus’s historic voyage, the Congress, 
by  joint  resolution  of  April  30,  1934,  and  modified  in  1968  (36  U.S.C. 
107), as amended, has requested the President proclaim the second Monday 
of October of each year as ‘‘Columbus Day.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  9,  2017, 
as  Columbus  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe 
this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities.  I  also  direct  that  the 
flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed 
day in honor of our diverse history and all who have contributed to shaping 
this Nation.

44289 

Proclamation  9639  of  September  15,  2017 

Constitution  Day,  Citizenship  Day,  and  Constitution  Week, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  the  230th  anniversary  of  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  we  cele-
brate  the  enduring  brilliance  of  our  Founding  Charter  and  recognize  all 
American  citizens.  Older  than  any  other  written  constitution  in  use  today, 
our  Constitution  establishes  a  system  of  checks  and  balances  designed  to 
preserve  liberty,  promote  prosperity,  and  ensure  the  security  of  our  beloved 
country.  On  this  day  and  during  this  week,  we  recall  the  people  and  the 
principles  that  made  our  Nation  great  and  commit  ourselves  to  restoring 
that greatness. 
Our  Constitution  is  founded  on  a  fundamental  trust  in  America’s  citizens. 
‘‘We  the  People,’’  the  Constitution  proclaims,  are  the  source  of  all  govern-
mental  authority.  We  are,  as  President  Lincoln  declared  in  the  war-torn 
fields  of  Gettysburg,  a  ‘‘Government  of  the  People,  by  the  People,  for  the 
People.’’  That  is  why  we  must  be  particularly  mindful  of  a  would-be  ruling 
class that has lost sight of this foundational truth. In the drive for progressive 
reform,  our  Federal  Government  has  grown  beyond  belief  and  has  layered 
regulation on top of burdensome regulation. American citizens and businesses 
face  an  unrelenting  onslaught  of  rules  and  regulations  adopted  by  an  army 
of regulators unaccountable to the citizens they seek to control. 
My solemn promise as President is to return power to the American People— 
to  the  workers  and  the  warriors  who  made  this  Nation  great  and  will 
make  it  great  again.  Restoring  this  founding  principle  of  accountability  re-
quires us to once again respect the structural safeguards of our great Constitu-
tion. The Framers of our Constitution sought to preserve liberty by separating 
government  power.  In  our  constitutional  system,  the  Congress  is  charged 
with  authoring  and  amending  the  laws,  in  accordance  with  its  beliefs  about 
what  will  benefit  our  country.  The  President’s  duty  is  to  execute  those 
laws  and  protect  the  Nation,  consistent  with  the  Constitution.  And  the 
Judiciary’s role is to faithfully apply the Constitution and the laws to resolve 
specific cases and controversies. Modern government, however, has rebelled 
against  the  constraints  inherent  in  these  defined  roles,  abandoning  that 
original  design  in  favor  of  a  centralized  system  of  out-of-control  agencies 
that  claim  independence  from  elected  leaders  and  demand  deference  from 
the courts. 
On  this  day  and  during  this  week,  I  call  on  all  citizens  and  all  branches 
of  government  to  reflect  on  the  original  meaning  of  our  Constitution,  and 
to  recall  the  founding  principles  we  too  frequently  forget:  Our  government 
exists  to  preserve  freedom  and  to  serve  its  citizens.  We  are  accountable 
to  the  People.  And  the  public  deserves  clear,  intelligible  laws  that  are 
enacted through an open, Constitutional process. 
As  the  elected  head  of  the  Executive  Branch,  I  call  on  Federal  agencies 
to reduce the crushing burdens of the regulatory state and to restore fairness, 
transparency,  and  due  process  in  all  regulatory  matters.  We  are  here  to 
enable  the  greatness  of  our  Nation,  not  to  restrain  it.  I  call  on  the  Congress 
to  take  up  critical  legislative  measures,  and  to  work  together  to  set  free 
the  full  potential  of  our  People.  I  call  on  Federal  judges  to  apply  the

law  as  it  exists,  not  as  they  wish  it  to  be—to  exercise,  in  the  words  of 
our  Founders,  ‘‘neither  force  nor  will,  but  merely  judgment.’’  And  I  call 
on  all  American  citizens  to  pursue  greatness  in  their  lives  through  hard 
work  and  the  insistence  that  their  government  exists  only  by  the  people, 
and for the people, of this great land. 
The  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  of  February  29,  1952  (36  U.S.C.  106), 
designated  September  17  as  ‘‘Constitution  Day  and  Citizenship  Day,’’  and 
by  joint  resolution  of  August  2,  1956  (36  U.S.C.  108),  requested  that  the 
President proclaim the week beginning September 17 and ending September 
23 of each year as ‘‘Constitution Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  17,  2017, 
as  Constitution  Day  and  Citizenship  Day,  and  September  17,  2017,  through 
September  23,  2017,  as  Constitution  Week.  On  this  day  and  during  this 
week, we celebrate the citizens and the Constitution that has made America 
the  greatest  Nation  this  world  has  ever  known.  In  doing  so,  we  recommit 
ourselves to the enduring principles of the Constitution and thereby ‘‘secure 
the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.’’ 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  fifteenth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and 
forty-second.

Proclamation  9589  of  April  6,  2017 

Education  and  Sharing  Day,  U.S.A.,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
At  the  core  of  the  American  Dream  lies  the  belief  that  our  futures  are 
not  pre-determined  and  can  be  improved  through  learning  and  hard  work. 
On Education and Sharing Day, we acknowledge the critical role of families, 
schools, and religious and other civic institutions in nurturing in our children 
the  values  that  enable  them  to  realize  the  full  scope  of  their  ambitions. 
Education  and  Sharing  Day  recognizes  the  remarkable  efforts  of  Rabbi 
Menachem  Mendel  Schneerson,  the  Lubavitcher  Rebbe,  to  use  values-based 
education  to  drive  our  Nation’s  children  toward  the  American  Dream.  As 
an  educator,  Rabbi  Schneerson  understood  that  education  is  incomplete 
if  it  is  devoid  of  moral  development.  Working  through  a  spirit  of  optimism, 
he  strived  to  teach  children  to  be  honest,  civil,  respectful  of  differences, 
and self-disciplined, in addition to being intellectually rigorous. 
On April 18, 1978, our Nation’s first Education Day, U.S.A., Rabbi Schneerson 
wrote  that  ‘‘we  can  neither  be  satisfied  nor  slacken  our  efforts’’  so  long 
as  ‘‘there  is  still  one  child  that  does  not  receive  an  adequate  education.’’ 
These  words  inspire  us  today,  as  they  did  then,  to  empower  our  children 
and  share  with  each  of  them  the  opportunity  and  promise  of  America. 
It  is  up  to  us  to  support  our  children  in  realizing  their  hopes  and  to 
encourage them to reach their fullest potential. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  7,  2017,  as 
‘‘Education  and  Sharing  Day,  U.S.A.’’  I  call  upon  government  officials,  edu-
cators,  volunteers,  and  all  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  this 
day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

The  President 

Proclamation  9652  of  October  5,  2017 

German-American  Day,  2017 

47361 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  October  6,  1683,  13  families  landed  in  Philadelphia,  having  set  sail 
earlier  that  year  from  the  German  city  of  Krefeld.  These  pioneers  founded 
the  first  German  settlement  in  America:  Germantown,  Pennsylvania,  the 
first  American  community  to  formally  protest  the  evils  of  slavery.  Since 
this  auspicious  beginning,  millions  of  German  immigrants  have  come  to 
our  Nation  in  pursuit  of  personal  and  religious  freedoms  and  economic 
opportunity.  These  immigrants  and  their  descendants  have  changed  the  tra-
jectory  of  the  United  States,  and  on  German-American  Day,  we  celebrate 
their role in helping our country thrive. 
The  more  than  44  million  Americans  who  claim  German  heritage  join  pre-
vious generations in making important contributions to every facet of Amer-
ican  life.  As  the  proud  grandson  of  German  grandparents,  I  am  keenly 
aware  of  how  German  Americans  have  helped  drive  our  economy,  enrich 
our  culture,  and  protect  and  defend  the  land  they  embrace  as  their  own. 
Notable  German-American  leaders  in  business  and  finance  include  William 
Boeing,  John  D.  Rockefeller,  Henry  Heinz,  and  Milton  S.  Hershey.  Many 
others, such as Neil Armstrong, George Herman ‘‘Babe’’ Ruth Jr., Walt Disney, 
Amelia Earhart, and the inimitable ‘‘Dr. Seuss’’ (Theodor Seuss Geisel) have 
become  beloved  figures.  German  Americans  Chester  Nimitz,  John  Pershing, 
and Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. are among the most decorated military officers 
in American history. American painters of German descent include Emanuel 
Leutze,  best  known  for  his  classic  work  Washington  Crossing  the  Delaware, 
and  Albert  Bierstadt,  whose  canvas  captured  the  majestic  beauty  of  the 
American  West.  German  Americans  have  also  designed  some  of  the  most 
iconic  landmarks  in  the  United  States,  including  Johann  August  Roebling’s 
Brooklyn  Bridge.  Even  the  quintessential  American  hot  dog  owes  a  debt 
to  German  immigrant  Charles  Feltman,  who  debuted  the  savory  treat  when 
he opened the first hot dog stand at Coney Island. 
Today,  the  United  States  and  Germany  enjoy  a  close  relationship  through 
our  shared  history  and  common  interests.  As  our  Nation’s  largest  ancestry 
group,  German  Americans  are  rightfully  proud  of  how  their  deep  cultural, 
historical,  and  familial  ties  have  helped  strengthen  this  robust  transatlantic 
relationship.  A  strong  partnership  between  the  United  States  and  Germany 
is  vital  to  ensuring  that  we  live  in  a  peaceful  world  filled  with  vibrant 
economic opportunities for all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  6,  2017, 
as German-American Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achieve-
ments and contributions of German Americans to our Nation with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9580  of  March  24,  2017 

Greek  Independence  Day:  A  National  Day  of  Celebration  of 
Greek  and  American  Democracy,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
This  year  marks  the  196th  anniversary  of  Greek  independence.  Greek  and 
American  democracy  are  forever  intertwined.  American  patriots  built  our 
Republic on the ancient Greeks’ groundbreaking idea that the people should 
decide their political fates. 
As  a  young  Nation,  only  recently  free  from  Great  Britain  and  securing 
its  place  on  the  world  stage,  America  served  as  a  source  of  inspiration 
for the revolutionary and freedom-loving Greeks who sought their own inde-
pendence. Indeed, American citizens stood united with the people of Greece 
in its ‘‘glorious cause’’ of democracy and freedom, as expressed by Philadel-
phia’s Franklin Gazette at the time. 
The  ideas  and  ideals  of  the  ancient  Greeks  altered  the  course  of  human 
history,  from  our  own  American  Republic  to  the  modern  Greek  state  and 
many other nations. All those who believe in the refrain ‘‘liberty and justice 
for  all,’’  and  who  are  devoted  to  democracy  and  rule  of  law,  owe  a  debt 
of  gratitude  to  Greece  and  the  foundational  principles  that  took  root  in 
the ancient city-state of Athens. 
On this Greek Independence Day, we express our deep gratitude for Greece’s 
enduring friendship in a region that has experienced great uncertainty. Greece 
is  an  important  partner  in  our  engagements  throughout  the  international 
sphere.  We  look  forward  to  strengthening  our  excellent  bilateral  defense 
relationship,  and  recognize  the  value  and  importance  Greece’s  role  as  a 
strong ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
The  American  people  join  Greece  in  celebrating  another  milestone  in  its 
independent  history,  and  we  look  forward  to  a  future  of  shared  success 
as partners and allies. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  25,  2017, 
as  Greek  Independence  Day:  A  National  Day  of  Celebration  of  Greek  and 
American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe 
this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

33769 

Proclamation  9627  of  July  17,  2017 

Made  in  America  Day  and  Made  in  America  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Today,  we  mark  the  first  Made  in  America  Day  and  recognize  the  vital 
contributions of American workers and job creators to our Nation’s prosperity 
and  strength.  America  owes  much  of  its  success  to  the  determination  and 
ingenuity of its entrepreneurs, workers, and farmers, who drive our economy 
and support our military strength. 
American  work  ethic  and  quality  craftsmanship  are  the  heart  and  soul  of 
our  Nation.  We  are  a  Nation  of  innovators,  builders,  and  farmers.  We  con-
struct  architectural  wonders  like  the  Golden  Gate  Bridge  and  the  New  York 
skyline.  We  feed  the  Nation  and  the  world  with  agricultural  products  like 
American  wheat,  corn,  and  beef.  We  drive  technological  innovation,  like 
the  internet  and  the  Global  Positioning  System,  from  visions  to  realities. 
My Administration recognizes the critical connection between a strong manu-
facturing base and a thriving economy. I am committed to promoting Amer-
ican  manufacturing,  opening  markets  around  the  world  for  our  producers, 
and protecting our businesses from unfair trade practices. And I am reducing 
job-killing  regulations  and  cutting  taxes,  making  it  more  attractive  than 
ever to do business in the United States. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  July  17,  2017,  as 
Made  in  America  Day  and  this  week,  July  16  through  July  22,  as  Made 
in  America  Week.  Today  and  this  week,  I  call  upon  Americans  to  pay 
special  tribute  to  the  builders,  to  the  ranchers,  to  the  crafters,  and  to  all 
those who work every day to make America great.

Proclamation  9608  of  May  12,  2017 

Military  Spouse  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Military  Spouse  Day,  we  honor  military  spouses  for  their  invaluable 
contributions  to  the  defense  of  this  great  Nation.  In  1984,  President  Ronald 
Reagan first recognized this day with a proclamation, honoring the exemplary 
service  and  immeasurable  sacrifices  of  our  Nation’s  military  spouses.  This 
long  overdue  tribute  gives  thanks  to  those  who,  since  the  formation  of 
our Republic, have served our country with selfless support. Military spouses 
have  been,  and  continue  to  be,  a  steady,  strong  presence  on  the  home 
front and in the hearts of our military men and women. 
Most  military  spouses  hold  no  rank  and  wear  no  uniform,  yet  humbly 
serve  our  Nation  with  distinction.  They  endure  deployments  for  weeks, 
months,  and  years  at  a  time,  sometimes  with  little  warning,  and  they  must 
brace  themselves  for  the  uncertainty  that  comes  with  goodbye.  When  duty 
calls, they shoulder the full day-to-day responsibilities of managing a house-
hold  and  often  of  parenting—many  times  with  little  or  no  support.  They 
face  frequent  relocations,  which  interrupt  their  careers  and  educational  pur-
suits and require them to leave churches, homes, and friends. Most difficult 
of  all,  military  spouses  live  with  constant  worry  about  the  daily  risks  our 
military  forces  take  for  our  country.  Military  spouses  navigate  these  and 
other challenges with uncommon grace and inspiring strength. 
My  Administration  will  focus  on  supporting  and  increasing  opportunities 
for  military  spouses.  I  urge  American  businesses  to  create  opportunities 
for  hiring,  training,  and  promoting  military  spouses,  and  to  identify  ways 
to  keep  them  employed  following  relocations.  These  women  and  men  have 
skills  and  experiences  valued  by  employers  and  coworkers  alike.  They  give 
so  much  of  themselves  to  our  country,  and  they  deserve  our  enduring 
respect  and  appreciation  in  return.  I  have  pledged  to  our  Armed  Forces 
to  have  their  backs,  and  that  means  providing  for  our  military  spouses 
as well. 
On  this  Military  Spouse  Day,  we  recognize  the  exceptional  women  and 
men  who  have  shared  their  loved  ones  with  our  country.  We  honor  them 
for their service, praise them for their sacrifices, and offer them our gratitude 
and prayers on behalf of a grateful Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  12,  2017,  as 
Military  Spouse  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  honor 
military spouses with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9572  of  February  1,  2017 

National  African  American  History  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  we  celebrate  National  African  American  History  Month,  we  recognize 
the heritage and achievements of African Americans. The contributions Afri-
can  Americans  have  made  and  continue  to  make  are  an  integral  part  of 
our  society,  and  the  history  of  African  Americans  exemplifies  the  resilience 
and innovative spirit that continue to make our Nation great. 
For  generations,  African  Americans  have  embodied  the  shared  progress  of 
our  Nation.  Through  toil  and  struggle  and  with  courageous  actions  that 
have  broken  barriers,  they  have  made  America  a  better  place  to  live  and 
work  for  everybody.  Women  like  Katherine  Johnson,  a  pioneer  in  space 
history  whose  work  helped  America  win  the  Space  Race,  and  Madam  C.J. 
Walker,  who  became  one  of  the  most  successful  female  entrepreneurs  of 
her  time,  paved  the  way  for  both  women  and  African  Americans  in  their 
respective  fields.  Robert  Smalls,  a  man  born  into  slavery,  founded  our  Na-
tion’s  first  free  and  compulsory  public  school  system.  Later  in  life,  he 
served  as  a  lawmaker  in  South  Carolina’s  State  legislature  and  the  U.S. 
House of Representatives. The strength and determination of men and women 
like these remind us that our Nation brims with people whose contributions 
continue to make it stronger and better. 
This  year,  African  American  History  Month  calls  upon  us  to  reflect  on 
the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans. It reminds 
us of the importance of teaching and reflecting upon the many roles African 
Americans  have  played  in  building  this  Nation  and  driving  it  forward. 
This  year’s  theme  also  calls  upon  us  to  rededicate  ourselves  to  the  work 
of ensuring that all children in this Nation have access to quality educational 
opportunities  that  give  them  the  skills,  experiences,  relationships,  and  cre-
dentials  that  can  empower  them  to  follow  in  the  footsteps  of  people  like 
Katherine Johnson, Madam C.J. Walker, and Robert Smalls. 
As  we  journey  toward  a  stronger,  more  united  Nation,  let  us  use  this  com-
memoration  of  African  American  History  Month  to  serve  as  a  reminder 
of  the  need  for  meaningful  dialogue  and  shared  commitment  to  collective 
action  that  uplifts  and  empowers,  as  well  as  of  the  strength,  ingenuity, 
and perseverance required of us in the years to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  February  2017  as 
National  African  American  History  Month.  I  call  upon  public  officials,  edu-
cators,  librarians,  and  all  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation  9633  of  August  31,  2017 

National  Alcohol  and  Drug  Addiction  Recovery  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

During  National  Alcohol  and  Drug  Addiction  Recovery  Month,  we  stand 
with the millions of Americans in recovery from alcohol and drug addiction, 
and  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  support  those  who  are  struggling  with 
addiction, and their families and loved ones. Substance abuse robs Americans 
of  their  potential,  shatters  their  families,  and  tears  apart  our  communities. 
My Administration is committed to lifting our Nation from this tragic reality. 

Substance  addiction  affects  people  of  every  class,  creed,  and  color.  More 
than  20  million  Americans  are  addicted  to  alcohol  or  other  drugs,  and 
countless  more  lives  have  been  touched  as  a  consequence  of  substance 
abuse. 

Together,  however,  we  can  fight  drug  and  alcohol  abuse.  This  month,  we 
emphasize to all those suffering that recovery is possible. My Administration 
is  taking  a  proactive  approach  to  support  State  and  local  communities  as 
they  work  on  the  front  lines  to  prevent  substance  use  and  addiction  and 
to  promote  recovery.  To  date,  we  have  dedicated  more  than  $500  million 
to  strengthening  prevention  programs,  expanding  access  to  evidence-based 
addiction  treatment,  and  building  networks  of  recovery  support  services 
across our Nation. And earlier this year, I established the President’s Commis-
sion  on  Combating  Drug  Addiction  and  the  Opioid  Crisis  to  help  guide 
the  Federal  Government’s  response  to  drug  abuse  and  drug  addiction,  with 
a  particular  focus  on  the  opioid  epidemic  that  is  currently  afflicting  our 
country. 

Solving  our  Nation’s  drug  and  alcohol  problems  requires  both  a  strong 
public  health  response  and  a  strong  public  safety  response  that  stems  the 
flow  of  illicit  drugs  into  our  communities.  I  have,  therefore,  requested  $2.6 
billion  in  my  2018  budget  proposal  for  border  security  and  infrastructure 
that  will  improve  our  ability  to  protect  Americans  and  the  homeland  from 
the dangers of drug trafficking. 

During National Alcohol and Drug Addiction Recovery Month, and through-
out  the  year,  let  us  remember  those  who  have  bravely  conquered  their 
addiction.  We  also  pray  for  those  currently  suffering  so  they  may,  through 
effective  treatment  and  the  strength  of  family  and  friends,  transform  their 
lives.  Finally,  let  us  also  thank  the  family  members,  friends,  and  healthcare 
providers  who  provide  much-needed  assistance,  encouragement,  and  love 
to support Americans in recovery. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  2017 
as  National  Alcohol  and  Drug  Addiction  Recovery  Month.  I  call  upon  the 
people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation  9634  of  September  1,  2017 

National  Day  of  Prayer  for  the  Victims  of  Hurricane  Harvey 
and  for  Our  National  Response  and  Recovery  Efforts 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Hurricane  Harvey  first  made  landfall  as  a  Category  4  storm  near  Rockport, 
Texas,  on  the  evening  of  August  25,  2017.  The  storm  has  since  devastated 
communities  in  both  Texas  and  Louisiana,  claiming  many  lives,  inflicting 
countless  injuries,  destroying  or  damaging  tens  of  thousands  of  homes,  and 
causing  billions  of  dollars  in  damage.  The  entire  Nation  grieves  with  Texas 
and  Louisiana.  We  are  deeply  grateful  for  those  performing  acts  of  service, 
and we pray for healing and comfort for those in need. 
Americans  have  always  come  to  the  aid  of  their  fellow  countrymen—friend 
helping  friend,  neighbor  helping  neighbor,  and  stranger  helping  stranger— 
and  we  vow  to  do  so  in  response  to  Hurricane  Harvey.  From  the  beginning 
of  our  Nation,  Americans  have  joined  together  in  prayer  during  times  of 
great  need,  to  ask  for  God’s  blessings  and  guidance.  This  tradition  dates 
to June 12, 1775, when the Continental Congress proclaimed a day of prayer 
following  the  Battles  of  Lexington  and  Concord,  and  April  30,  1789,  when 
President George Washington, during the Nation’s first Presidential inaugura-
tion, asked Americans to pray for God’s protection and favor. 
When  we  look  across  Texas  and  Louisiana,  we  see  the  American  spirit 
of  service  embodied  by  countless  men  and  women.  Brave  first  responders 
have  rescued  those  stranded  in  drowning  cars  and  rising  water.  Families 
have  given  food  and  shelter  to  those  in  need.  Houses  of  worship  have 
organized  efforts  to  clean  up  communities  and  repair  damaged  homes.  Indi-
viduals  of  every  background  are  striving  for  the  same  goal—to  aid  and 
comfort  people  facing  devastating  losses.  As  Americans,  we  know  that  no 
challenge is too great for us to overcome. 
As  response  and  recovery  efforts  continue,  and  as  Americans  provide  much 
needed  relief  to  the  people  of  Texas  and  Louisiana,  we  are  reminded  of 
Scripture’s  promise  that  ‘‘God  is  our  refuge  and  strength,  a  very  present 
help  in  trouble.’’  Melania  and  I  are  grateful  to  everyone  devoting  time, 
effort, and resources to the ongoing response, recovery, and rebuilding efforts. 
We  invite  all  Americans  to  join  us  as  we  continue  to  pray  for  those  who 
have  lost  family  members  or  friends,  and  for  those  who  are  suffering  in 
this time of crisis. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  3,  2017,  as  a  National  Day 
of Prayer for the Victims of Hurricane Harvey and for our National Response 
and  Recovery  Efforts.  We  give  thanks  for  the  generosity  and  goodness  of 
all  those  who  have  responded  to  the  needs  of  their  fellow  Americans. 
I  urge  Americans  of  all  faiths  and  religious  traditions  and  backgrounds 
to  offer  prayers  today  for  all  those  harmed  by  Hurricane  Harvey,  including 
people  who  have  lost  family  members  or  been  injured,  those  who  have 
lost  homes  or  other  property,  and  our  first  responders,  law  enforcement 
officers,  military  personnel,  and  medical  professionals  leading  the  response 
and  recovery  efforts.  Each  of  us,  in  our  own  way,  may  call  upon  our 
God for strength and comfort during this difficult time. I call on all Americans 
and houses of worship throughout the Nation to join in one voice of prayer,

The  President 

Proclamation  9635  of  September  8,  2017 

National  Days  of  Prayer  and  Remembrance,  2017 

43293 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Days  of  Prayer  and  Remembrance,  our  Nation  recalls  the 
nearly  3,000  innocent  people  murdered  on  September  11,  2001.  As  we 
reflect  on  our  sorrow  and  our  grief,  we  come  together  to  pray  for  those 
who  lost  loved  ones.  As  a  Nation,  we  pray  that  the  love  of  God  and 
the  comfort  of  knowing  that  those  who  perished  are  forever  remembered 
brings them peace and gives them courage. 
We  pause  to  remember  that  tragic  morning,  when  our  homeland  endured 
unprecedented  attacks.  As  we  watched  smoke  billow  from  the  World  Trade 
Center,  we  prayed  for  the  safety  of  our  fellow  Americans,  and  we  reached 
out  to  help,  however  we  could.  Now,  during  these  days  of  prayer  and 
remembrance,  we  remind  ourselves  of  the  lives—mothers,  fathers,  sons,  and 
daughters—lost  at  the  World  Trade  Center,  at  the  Pentagon,  and  aboard 
United  Flight  93  when  it  crashed  near  Shanksville,  Pennsylvania.  We  also 
honor the brave first responders who rushed into crumbling buildings, risking 
their  own  lives  to  rescue  others.  More  than  400  first  responders  lost  their 
lives in those efforts, so that others would not perish. 
Today,  a  single  tree  stands  near  the  base  of  what  was  once  the  Twin 
Towers  of  the  World  Trade  Center,  having  survived  that  fateful  day  16 
years  ago.  This  tree,  the  ‘‘Survivor  Tree,’’  stands  as  a  living  testament  to 
our  national  character  of  triumph.  Like  the  Survivor  Tree,  we  continue 
to  stand  tall  and  strong  as  one  Nation.  Try  as  they  might,  terrorists  will 
never defeat our resilient American spirit. 
We  also  pause  to  pray  for  those  who  fight  today  and  every  day  to  protect 
our  country  from  terrorism.  Those  who  commit  acts  of  terror  only  have 
power  if  we  choose  to  fear.  In  remembrance  of  September  11,  2001,  Ameri-
cans reveal their courage, strength, and resolve. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  Friday,  September 
8,  through  Sunday,  September  10,  2017,  as  National  Days  of  Prayer  and 
Remembrance. I ask that the people of the United States mark these National 
Days  of  Prayer  and  Remembrance  with  prayer,  contemplation,  memorial 
services,  the  visiting  of  memorials,  the  ringing  of  bells,  and  evening  candle-
light  remembrance  vigils.  I  invite  all  people  around  the  world  to  share 
in these Days of Prayer and Remembrance.

Proclamation  9591  of  April  7,  2017 

National  Former  Prisoner  of  War  Recognition  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  National  Former  Prisoner  of  War  Recognition  Day,  America  honors  our 
service men and women imprisoned during war. These patriots have moved 
and  inspired  our  Nation  through  their  unyielding  sacrifices  and  devout 
allegiance.  We  honor  the  strength  through  adversity  of  all  of  these  heroes 
from  our  Nation’s  wars  and  conflicts,  from  the  American  Revolution  to 
the  World  Wars,  from  Korea  to  Vietnam,  from  Desert  Storm  to  the  War 
on Terror. 
American  service  members  serve  and  fight  selflessly  each  day  to  secure 
the  freedoms  we  often  take  for  granted.  They  bear  the  full  weight  of  their 
oath  to  ‘‘support  and  defend  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States  against 
all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic,’’  in  which  there  is  no  safety  clause. 
None  know  this  so  well  as  our  former  prisoners  of  war  (POWs).  According 
to  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  more  than  half  a  million  Americans 
have  been  captured  and  interned  as  POWs  since  the  American  Revolution. 
This  year  marks  the  75th  anniversary  of  the  Bataan  Death  March.  After 
the  surrender  of  the  Bataan  peninsula  in  the  Philippines  on  April  9,  1942, 
Filipino  and  American  soldiers  were  rounded  up  and  forced  to  march  60 
miles  from  Mariveles  to  San  Fernando.  An  estimated  500  Americans  died 
during  the  march,  as  they  were  starved,  beaten,  and  tortured  to  death. 
Those  who  reached  San  Fernando  were  taken  in  cramped  boxcars  to  POW 
camps,  where  thousands  more  Americans  died  of  disease  and  starvation. 
These  stories  remind  us  of  the  great  sacrifice  and  bravery  of  our  men 
and  women  in  the  Armed  Forces.  Throughout  our  history,  they  have  risked 
everything  to  defend  our  country.  They  have  been  stripped  of  liberty,  and 
regained  it.  They  have  faced  the  darkness  of  captivity,  and  emerged  to 
the  warm  light  of  freedom.  These  victories  have  no  match.  These  triumphs 
ignite  the  flame  of  liberty  deep  within  their  hearts,  and  in  ours,  and  make 
America the great Nation it is today. 
But in celebrating those POWs who returned from captivity, we also solemnly 
remember  and  honor  those  who  died  in  captivity.  They  paid  the  ultimate 
price for their love of country. 
As  President,  I  am  committed  to  providing  our  veterans,  and  especially 
our  former  POWs,  with  the  support,  care,  and  resources  they  deserve.  Our 
country  owes  a  debt  to  our  heroes  that  we  can  never  adequately  repay, 
but which we will always honor each day. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  9,  2017,  as 
National  Former  Prisoner  of  War  Recognition  Day.  I  call  upon  Americans 
to  observe  this  day  by  honoring  the  service  and  sacrifice  of  all  our  former 
prisoners  of  war  and  to  express  our  Nation’s  eternal  gratitude  for  their 
sacrifice.  I  also  call  upon  Federal,  State,  and  local  government  officials 
and organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activi-
ties.

Proclamation  9629  of  July  26,  2017 

National  Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  National  Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day,  we  honor  the  patriots 
who  defended  the  Korean  Peninsula  against  the  spread  of  Communism  in 
what  became  the  first  major  conflict  of  the  Cold  War.  We  remember  those 
who  laid  down  their  lives  in  defense  of  liberty,  in  a  land  far  from  home, 
and we vow to preserve their legacy. 
Situated  between  World  War  II  and  the  Vietnam  War,  the  Korean  War 
has  often  been  labeled  as  the  ‘‘Forgotten  War,’’  despite  its  having  claimed 
the  lives  of  more  than  36,000  Americans.  The  Korean  War  began  on  June 
25,  1950,  when  North  Korean  forces,  backed  by  the  Soviet  Union,  invaded 
South  Korea.  Shortly  thereafter,  American  troops  arrived  and  pushed  back 
the  North  Koreans.  For  3  years,  alongside  fifteen  allies  and  partners,  we 
fought  an  unrelenting  war  of  attrition.  Through  diplomatic  engagements 
led by President Eisenhower, Americans secured peace on the Korean Penin-
sula.  On  July  27,  1953,  North  Korea,  China,  and  the  United  Nations  signed 
an armistice suspending all hostilities. 
While  the  armistice  stopped  the  active  fighting  in  the  region,  North  Korea’s 
ballistic  and  nuclear  weapons  programs  continue  to  pose  grave  threats  to 
the  United  States  and  our  allies  and  partners.  At  this  moment,  more  than 
28,000  American  troops  maintain  a  strong  allied  presence  along  the  38th 
parallel,  which  separates  North  and  South  Korea.  These  troops,  and  the 
rest  of  our  Armed  Forces,  help  me  fulfill  my  unwavering  commitment  as 
President  to  protecting  Americans  at  home  and  to  steadfastly  defending 
our allies abroad. 
As  we  reflect  upon  our  values  and  pause  to  remember  all  those  who  fight 
and sacrifice to uphold them, we will never forget our Korean War veterans 
whose  valiant  efforts  halted  the  spread  of  Communism  and  advanced  the 
cause of freedom.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9592  of  April  14,  2017 

National  Park  Week,  2017 

18545 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

This  year  we  celebrate  National  Park  Week  as  the  National  Park  Service 
begins  its  second  century  as  a  critical  guardian  of  America’s  Federal  public 
lands.  During  National  Park  Week,  national  parks  across  our  country  waive 
their  entrance  fees  and  welcome  all  explorers  to  experience,  as  past  genera-
tions have, the history and splendor of our Nation’s treasures. 

The  national  park  system  started  with  a  painting.  In  1872,  Thomas  Moran 
painted The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, presented it to the Congress, 
and  captivated  countless  Americans.  Inspired  by  Moran’s  beautiful  illustra-
tion and western explorers’ stories, photographs, and sketches, the Congress 
and President Ulysses S. Grant enacted the Yellowstone National Park Protec-
tion  Act.  This  law  established  Yellowstone  as  the  world’s  first  national 
park  and  transformed  how  we  protect  many  of  our  Nation’s  landmarks. 

Forty years later, President Theodore Roosevelt, known as the ‘‘Conservation 
President,’’ established Crater Lake, Oregon, as our fifth national park. During 
his presidency, Roosevelt doubled the number of national parks, designating, 
in  addition  to  Crater  Lake:  Wind  Cave,  South  Dakota;  Sullys  Hill,  North 
Dakota;  Mesa  Verde,  Colorado;  and  Platt,  Oklahoma.  Given  his  instrumental 
role  in  expanding  our  national  park  system,  it  is  fitting  that  his  likeness 
endures at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. 

Today,  visitors  from  around  the  world  travel  to  our  Nation’s  59  national 
parks  to  climb  snow-capped  peaks,  splash  under  majestic  falls,  rappel  into 
the  deepest  canyons,  and  find  peace  in  shaded  forests.  Our  parks  routinely 
provide  visitors  with  unforgettable,  sometimes  life-changing  experiences. 
From  their  unsurpassed  beauty  to  their  unmatched  physical  challenges,  our 
parks  capture  the  spirit  of  America’s  pioneering  history.  They  symbolize 
our  ongoing  commitment  to  the  preservation  of  our  land  and  wildlife,  and 
they set the conservation standard for the rest of the world. 

It  is  a  priority  of  my  Administration  to  protect  these  magnificent  lands, 
and  to  ensure  all  Americans  have  access  to  our  national  parks,  as  well 
as  to  other  National  Park  Service  sites,  throughout  the  next  century.  For 
this  reason,  I  chose  to  donate  the  first  portion  of  my  salary  as  President 
to  the  American  Battlefield  Protection  Program,  which  the  National  Park 
Service  uses  to  preserve  significant  American  battlefields.  It  is  my  hope 
that  we  will  pass  down  these  natural  and  historic  sites  to  our  children 
and grandchildren. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  15  through 
April 23, 2017, as National Park Week. I encourage all Americans to celebrate 
by visiting our national parks and learning more about the natural, cultural, 
and  historical  heritage  that  belongs  to  each  and  every  citizen  of  the  United 
States of America.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9578  of  March  17,  2017 

National  Poison  Prevention  Week,  2017 

14809 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  United  States  has  made  great  strides  in  preventing  unintentional  child-
hood poisoning deaths. Thanks to combined national, State, and local efforts 
over the course of years, Americans have reduced childhood fatalities related 
to  accidental  poisoning  in  the  United  States  from  200  deaths  per  year  to 
27 per year, which is an 88 percent decline. From a public health perspective, 
this is a resounding achievement. 
Fifty-five years ago, President John F. Kennedy noted that virtually all deaths 
attributable  to  accidental  poisoning  could  be  prevented.  He  was  right— 
we  as  a  society  must  do  much  more  to  prevent  tragic  and  preventable 
loss of life from occurring. Ensuring the safety and security of the American 
people  requires  that  we  unequivocally  commit  to  a  continuation  of  the 
successful  policies  that  have  reduced  accidental  childhood  poisonings  and 
injuries. 
This  week  we  warn  all  Americans  about  unintended  exposure  to  poisons 
and  the  threat  of  household  items  unintentionally  being  turned  into  deadly 
weapons.  This  is  an  important  reminder—and  one  that  could  save  lives. 
To  encourage  Americans  to  learn  more  about  the  dangers  of  unintentional 
poisonings  and  to  take  appropriate  preventative  measures,  on  September 
26,  1961,  the  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  (75  Stat.  681),  authorized  and 
requested  the  President  to  issue  a  proclamation  designating  the  third  week 
of March each year as, ‘‘National Poison Prevention Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  19 
through  March  25,  2017,  as  National  Poison  Prevention  Week.  I  call  upon 
all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguard our families 
from  poisonous  products,  chemicals,  and  medicines  found  in  our  homes.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9632  of  August  30,  2017 

National  Preparedness  Month,  2017 

42019 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Preparedness  Month,  we  bring  attention  to  the  importance 
of  readying  ourselves  for  disasters,  both  natural  and  man-made.  We  also 
take  this  time  to  extend  our  sincerest  gratitude  to  first  responders,  who 
selflessly  run  toward  danger  to  keep  our  Nation  and  its  people  safe.  We 
vow to support them and provide the tools they need to save lives. 
This  year  marks  the  5-year  anniversary  of  Hurricane  Sandy,  which  ravaged 
the  Northeast;  the  10-year  anniversary  of  the  Enhanced  Fujita  (EF)  level- 
5  tornado  that  leveled  95  percent  of  the  Greensburg,  Kansas,  community; 
and  the  25-year  anniversary  of  Hurricane  Andrew,  the  most  destructive 
hurricane  in  Florida’s  history.  And,  this  week  we  are  especially  mindful 
of those affected by the catastrophic Hurricane Harvey, which brought historic 
floods  to  Texas.  While  these  tragedies  underscore  our  vulnerabilities,  they 
also  remind  us  of  our  Nation’s  great  resilience.  In  the  responses  to  each 
of  these  unexpected  disasters,  we  have  seen  the  character  of  the  American 
spirit—courageousness, determination, and generosity. 
This  month  we  recognize  that  by  educating  the  Nation  on  how  to  prepare 
and  respond  to  emergencies,  we  can  save  countless  lives.  Unfortunately, 
fewer  than  half  of  American  families  report  having  an  emergency  response 
plan. While we never know when the next disaster will strike, it is incumbent 
upon every American to be prepared. 
Americans  can  start  today  to  improve  our  readiness  for  the  next  disaster. 
The  first  steps  include  making  and  practicing  a  family  emergency  response 
plan, creating an emergency supply kit, and signing up for emergency alerts. 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Ready campaign outlines addi-
tional  important  and  low-cost  measures  Americans  can  take  right  now  to 
protect  their  family,  pets,  and  property  before  a  major  disaster.  Together, 
we will create a stronger and safer Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  2017 
as  National  Preparedness  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans,  including  Fed-
eral,  State,  and  local  officials,  to  take  action  to  be  prepared  for  disaster 
or  emergency  by  making  and  practicing  their  plans.  Each  step  we  take 
to  become  better  prepared  will  make  a  real  difference  in  how  our  families 
and  communities  will  respond  and  persevere  when  faced  with  the  unex-
pected.

Proclamation  9593  of  April  21,  2017 

National  Volunteer  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Volunteer  Week,  we  celebrate  the  spirit  of  compassion 
and generosity that drives us to care for others, and we recognize America’s 
volunteers. Our volunteers are often unsung and unseen, but they are heroes. 
One  of  our  Nation’s  greatest  strengths  has  always  been  our  citizens’  unique 
commitment  to  improving  the  lives  of  others.  The  principles  of  charitable 
compassion and philanthropic collaboration were at the heart of our Found-
ing  Fathers’  efforts  to  build  a  culture  that  serves  the  greater  good.  From 
our earliest days, Americans have answered the call to help those in need— 
at  home  and  around  the  world.  This  service,  fundamental  to  our  Nation’s 
character,  is  renewed  each  day  by  citizens  who  generously  give  their  time 
and talents to help others. 
Our Nation’s commitment to civic engagement continues to thrive. American 
volunteers  keep  students  on  track  for  graduation,  care  for  seniors  and  vet-
erans,  and  rebuild  communities  after  terrible  storms.  Beyond  our  borders, 
our  volunteers  often  place  their  lives  at  risk  as  they  help  those  affected 
by war, poverty, and disease. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 60 million Americans 
volunteered  in  2015,  giving  an  estimated  $185  billion  in  service  to  their 
communities.  The  latest  data  shows  that  our  Nation’s  seniors  lead  the  way 
in time spent volunteering, and we are immensely thankful for their commit-
ment.  Our  busy  adults  aged  35  to  54  volunteer  at  the  highest  rates,  and 
our  communities  depend  on  their  continued  involvement.  Our  Nation  con-
tinues  to  build  a  culture  of  service—the  volunteer  rate  among  our  teenagers 
has steadily climbed over the past several years. 
This week we pay tribute to the extraordinary faith-based, nonprofit, national 
service,  service  club,  military  service,  and  community  organizations  that 
provide  volunteers  with  opportunities  to  serve.  These  organizations  engage 
and  connect  Americans  from  every  walk  of  life.  Through  the  generosity 
of  our  citizens,  we  are  reminded  that  each  one  of  us  has  a  role  to  play 
in  improving  our  communities.  During  the  recent  International  Week  of 
Service, service organizations across the globe came together to assist others 
and  make  an  impact.  This  effort  is  a  shining  example  of  how  our  Nation’s 
generous  volunteers  continue  to  lead  the  world  in  helping  those  most  in 
need. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  23  through 
April  29,  2017,  as  National  Volunteer  Week.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  week  by  volunteering  in  service  projects  across  our  country 
and pledging to make service a part of their daily lives.

Executive  Order  13789  of  April  21,  2017 

Identifying  and  Reducing  Tax  Regulatory  Burdens 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  Federal  tax  system  should  be  simple,  fair,  efficient, 
and  pro-growth.  The  purposes  of  tax  regulations  should  be  to  bring  clarity 
to the already complex Internal Revenue Code (title 26, United States Code) 
and  to  provide  useful  guidance  to  taxpayers.  Contrary  to  these  purposes, 
numerous  tax  regulations  issued  over  the  last  several  years  have  effectively 
increased  tax  burdens,  impeded  economic  growth,  and  saddled  American 
businesses with onerous fines, complicated forms, and frustration. Immediate 
action  is  necessary  to  reduce  the  burden  existing  tax  regulations  impose 
on  American  taxpayers  and  thereby  to  provide  tax  relief  and  useful,  sim-
plified tax guidance. 
Sec.  2.  Addressing  Tax  Regulatory  Burdens.  (a)  In  furtherance  of  the  policy 
described in section 1 of this order, the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) 
shall immediately review all significant tax regulations issued by the Depart-
ment  of  the  Treasury  on  or  after  January  1,  2016,  and,  in  consultation 
with  the  Administrator  of  the  Office  of  Information  and  Regulatory  Affairs, 
Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  identify  in  an  interim  report  to  the 
President all such regulations that: 

(i) impose an undue financial burden on United States taxpayers; 
(ii) add undue complexity to the Federal tax laws; or 
(iii) exceed the statutory authority of the Internal Revenue Service. 

This  interim  report  shall  be  completed  no  later  than  60  days  from  the 
date  of  this  order.  In  conducting  the  review  required  by  this  subsection, 
earlier  determinations  of  whether  a  regulation  is  significant  pursuant  to 
Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended (Regulatory Plan-
ning and Review), shall not be controlling. 

(b)  No  later  than  150  days  from  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary 
shall prepare and submit a report to the President that recommends specific 
actions  to  mitigate  the  burden  imposed  by  regulations  identified  in  the 
interim  report  required  under  subsection  (a)  of  this  section.  The  Secretary 
shall  also  publish  this  report  in  the  Federal  Register  upon  submitting  it 
to  the  President.  The  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate  steps  to  cause  the 
effective  date  of  such  regulations  to  be  delayed  or  suspended,  to  the  extent 
permitted  by  law,  and  to  modify  or  rescind  such  regulations  as  appropriate 
and consistent with law, including, if necessary, through notice and comment 
rulemaking. The Secretary shall submit for publication in the Federal Register 
a  summary  of  the  actions  taken  in  response  to  the  report  no  later  than 
10  days  following  the  finalization  of  such  actions.  Should  all  such  actions 
not  be  finalized  within  180  days  following  the  submission  of  the  report 
to  the  President,  the  Secretary  shall  submit  for  publication  in  the  Federal 
Register an initial report summarizing the actions taken to that point. 

(c)  To  ensure  that  future  tax  regulations  adhere  to  the  policy  described 
in  section  1  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  and  the  Director  of  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget  shall  review  and,  if  appropriate,  reconsider 
the  scope  and  implementation  of  the  existing  exemption  for  certain  tax 
regulations  from  the  review  process  set  forth  in  Executive  Order  12866 
and any successor order.

Notice  of  September  18,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Per-
sons  Who  Commit,  Threaten  To  Commit,  or  Support  Ter-
rorism 

On  September  23,  2001,  by  Executive  Order  13224,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  persons  who  commit,  threaten  to 
commit,  or  support  terrorism,  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Eco-
nomic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and 
extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  grave  acts  of  terrorism  and  threats  of 
terrorism  committed  by  foreign  terrorists,  including  the  terrorist  attacks  on 
September 11, 2001, in New York and Pennsylvania and against the Pentagon, 
and  the  continuing  and  immediate  threat  of  further  attacks  against  United 
States nationals or the United States. 

The actions of persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the 
national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13224  of  September  23, 
2001,  and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond September 23, 2017. Therefore, in accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  persons 
who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism declared in Executive 
Order 13224. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  September  11,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Cer-

Consistent  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act,  50  U.S.C. 
1622(d),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  previously  de-
clared  on  September  14,  2001,  in  Proclamation  7463,  with  respect  to  the 
terrorist  attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  and  the  continuing  and  immediate 
threat of further attacks on the United States. 
Because  the  terrorist  threat  continues,  the  national  emergency  declared  on 
September  14,  2001,  and  the  powers  and  authorities  adopted  to  deal  with 
that  emergency  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  September  14,  2017.  There-

Memorandum  of  August  14,  2017 

Addressing  China’s  Laws,  Policies,  Practices,  and  Actions  Re-
lated  to  Intellectual  Property,  Innovation,  and  Technology 

Memorandum  for  the  United  States  Trade  Representative 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  directed  as  follows: 
Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States for our trade relations 
to  enhance  our  economic  growth,  contribute  favorably  to  our  balance  of 
trade,  promote  reciprocal  treatment  of  American  goods  and  investment,  and 
strengthen the American manufacturing base. 
The  United  States  is  a  world  leader  in  research-and-development-intensive, 
high-technology  goods.  Violations  of  intellectual  property  rights  and  other 
unfair technology transfers potentially threaten United States firms by under-
mining their ability to compete fairly in the global market. China has imple-
mented laws, policies, and practices and has taken actions related to intellec-
tual  property,  innovation,  and  technology  that  may  encourage  or  require 
the  transfer  of  American  technology  and  intellectual  property  to  enterprises 
in China or that may otherwise negatively affect American economic interests. 
These laws, policies, practices, and actions may inhibit United States exports, 
deprive  United  States  citizens  of  fair  remuneration  for  their  innovations, 
divert  American  jobs  to  workers  in  China,  contribute  to  our  trade  deficit 
with  China,  and  otherwise  undermine  American  manufacturing,  services, 
and innovation. 
Sec. 2. Determination of Whether to Conduct Investigation. The United States 
Trade  Representative  shall  determine,  consistent  with  section  302(b)  of  the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2412(b)), whether to investigate any of China’s 
laws,  policies,  practices,  or  actions  that  may  be  unreasonable  or  discrimina-
tory and that may be harming American intellectual property rights, innova-
tion, or technology development. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  memorandum  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable 

law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c)  This  memorandum  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right 
or  benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by 
any  party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities, 
its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

30711 

Proclamation  9625  of  June  29,  2017 

To  Modify  Duty-Free  Treatment  Under  the  Generalized  Sys-
tem  of  Preferences  and  for  Other  Purposes 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  Pursuant  to  sections  501  and  503(a)(1)(A)  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974, 
as amended (the ‘‘1974 Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)(1)(A)), the President 
may,  after  receiving  the  advice  of  the  United  States  International  Trade 
Commission  (the  ‘‘Commission’’),  designate  certain  articles  as  eligible  for 
preferential  tariff  treatment  under  the  Generalized  System  of  Preferences 
(GSP) when they are imported from designated beneficiary developing coun-
tries. 
2.  Pursuant  to  sections  501,  503(a)(1)(A),  and  503(b)(5)  of  the  1974  Act 
(19  U.S.C.  2463(b)(5)),  and  having  received  advice  from  the  Commission 
in  accordance  with  section  503(e)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(e)), 
I  have  determined  to  designate  certain  articles  as  eligible  articles  when 
they are imported from beneficiary developing countries. 
3.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(1)), 
the  President  may  withdraw,  suspend,  or  limit  application  of  the  duty- 
free  treatment  accorded  to  specified  articles  under  the  GSP  when  imported 
from designated beneficiary developing countries. 
4.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  having  considered 
the  factors  set  forth  in  sections  501  and  502(c)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2462(c)), I have determined to withdraw the application of duty-free treatment 
accorded to a certain article. 
5.  Section  503(c)(2)(A)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2)(A))  subjects 
beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed 
beneficiary developing countries or beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries 
as provided in section 503(c)(2)(D) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(D)), 
to  competitive  need  limitations  on  the  preferential  treatment  afforded  to 
eligible articles under the GSP. 
6.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(2)(A)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined 
that in 2016 certain beneficiary developing countries exported eligible articles 
in quantities exceeding the applicable competitive need limitations. I hereby 
terminate  the  duty-free  treatment  for  such  articles  from  such  beneficiary 
developing countries. 
7. Section 503(c)(2)(F)(i) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)(F)(i)) provides 
that  the  President  may  disregard  the  competitive  need  limitation  provided 
in  section  503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)) 
with  respect  to  any  eligible  article  from  any  beneficiary  developing  country 
if  the  aggregate  appraised  value  of  the  imports  of  any  such  article  into 
the  United  States  during  the  preceding  calendar  year  does  not  exceed  the 
amount  set  forth  in  section  503(c)(2)(F)(ii)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C. 
2463(c)(2)(F)(ii)). 
8.  Pursuant  to  section  503(c)(2)(F)(i)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  determined 
that  the  competitive  need  limitation  provided  in  section  503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) 
of the 1974 Act should be disregarded with respect to certain eligible articles 
from certain beneficiary developing countries.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  125 / Friday,  June  30,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

9.  Section  503(d)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(d)(1))  provides  that 
the President may waive the application of the competitive need limitations 
in  section  503(c)(2)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2463(c)(2))  with  respect 
to  any  eligible  article  from  any  beneficiary  developing  country  if  certain 
conditions are met. 
10.  Pursuant  to  section  503(d)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  received  the 
advice  of  the  Commission  on  whether  any  industry  in  the  United  States 
is  likely  to  be  adversely  affected  by  such  waivers  of  the  competitive  need 
limitations provided in section 503(c)(2) of the 1974 Act. I have determined, 
based  on  that  advice  and  the  considerations  described  in  sections  501  and 
502(c)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  having  given  great  weight  to  the  considerations 
in section 503(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(d)(2)), that such waivers 
are  in  the  national  economic  interest  of  the  United  States.  Accordingly, 
I  have  determined  that  the  competitive  need  limitations  of  section  503(c)(2) 
of  the  1974  Act  should  be  waived  with  respect  to  a  certain  eligible  article 
from a certain beneficiary developing country. 
11. Presidential Proclamation 8997 of June 27, 2013, suspended Bangladesh’s 
designation  as  a  beneficiary  developing  country  for  the  purposes  of  the 
GSP.  Presidential  Proclamation  9333  of  September  30,  2015,  terminated 
Venezuela’s designation as a beneficiary developing country for the purposes 
of the GSP. These proclamations made corresponding modifications to general 
note 4 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Those 
modifications included technical errors, and I have determined that modifica-
tions to the HTS are necessary to correct them. 
12. Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, implemented the World 
Trade  Organization  Declaration  on  the  Expansion  of  Trade  in  Information 
Technology  Products  (the  ‘‘Declaration’’)  and,  pursuant  to  section  111(b) 
of  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3521(b)),  modified  the 
HTS  to  include  the  schedule  of  duty  reductions  necessary  to  carry  out 
the  Declaration.  Those  modifications  included  technical  errors,  and  I  have 
determined  that  modifications  to  the  HTS  are  necessary  to  correct  them. 
13. Presidential Proclamation 8097 of December 29, 2006, implemented modi-
fications  to  the  HTS,  pursuant  to  section  1206(a)  of  the  Omnibus  Trade 
and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988  (the  ‘‘1988  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  3006(a)), 
to  include  changes  to  the  schedule  considered  necessary  or  appropriate 
by  the  Commission  to  accomplish  the  purposes  of  section  1205(a)  of  the 
1988  Act  (19  U.S.C.  3005(a)).  Those  modifications  to  the  HTS  were  set 
out  in  Publication  3898  of  the  Commission,  entitled  ‘‘Modifications  to  the 
Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  of  the  United  States  under  Section  1206  of 
the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988,’’  which  was  incor-
porated  by  reference  into  Presidential  Proclamation  8097.  Annex  I  to  that 
publication included a technical error, and I have determined that a modifica-
tion to the HTS is necessary to correct it. 
14. Presidential Proclamation 9549 of December 1, 2016, implemented modi-
fications to the HTS, pursuant to section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act, to include 
changes to the schedule considered necessary or appropriate by the Commis-
sion  to  accomplish  the  purposes  of  section  1205(a)  of  the  1988  Act.  Those 
modifications to the HTS were set out in Publication 4653 of the Commission, 
entitled  ‘‘Modifications  to  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  of  the  United 
States  under  Section  1206  of  the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act 
of  1988  and  for  Other  Purposes,’’  which  was  incorporated  by  reference 
into  Presidential  Proclamation  9549.  Annex  I  to  that  publication  included 
technical  errors,  and  I  have  determined  that  modifications  to  the  HTS  are 
necessary to correct them. 
15.  Section  604  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2483)  authorizes  the  President 
to  embody  in  the  HTS  the  substance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that 
Act,  and  of  other  Acts  affecting  import  treatment,  and  actions  thereunder, 
including  removal,  modification,  continuance,  or  imposition  of  any  rate 
of duty or other import restriction.

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  acting  under  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  title  V  and  section 
604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: 

(1)  In  order  to  designate  certain  articles  as  eligible  articles  when  imported 
from  a  beneficiary  developing  country  for  purposes  of  the  GSP,  the  Rates 
of  Duty  1–Special  subcolumn  for  the  corresponding  HTS  subheadings  is 
modified as set forth in section A of Annex I to this proclamation. 

(2)  In  order  to  provide  that  one  or  more  countries  should  no  longer  be 
treated  as  beneficiary  developing  countries  with  respect  to  one  or  more 
eligible  articles  for  purposes  of  the  GSP,  the  Rates  of  Duty  1–Special  sub-
column  for  the  corresponding  HTS  subheadings  and  general  note  4(d)  to 
the  HTS  are  modified  as  set  forth  in  sections  B,  C,  and  D  of  Annex  I 
to this proclamation. 

(3)  The  competitive  need  limitation  provided  in  section  503(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) 
of  the  1974  Act  is  disregarded  with  respect  to  the  eligible  articles  in  the 
HTS subheadings and to the beneficiary developing countries listed in Annex 
II to this proclamation, effective July 1, 2017. 

(4)  A  waiver  of  the  application  of  section  503(c)(2)  of  the  1974  Act  shall 
apply to the article in the HTS subheading and to the beneficiary developing 
country  set  forth  in  Annex  III  to  this  proclamation,  effective  July  1,  2017. 

(5) In order to make technical corrections necessary to reflect the suspension 
of  benefits  under  the  GSP  with  respect  to  Bangladesh  and  the  termination 
of  benefits  under  the  GSP  with  respect  to  Venezuela,  the  HTS  is  modified 
as set forth in Annex IV to this proclamation. 

(6) In order to make technical corrections necessary to provide the intended 
tariff  treatment  to  goods  covered  by  the  Declaration  in  accordance  with 
Presidential  Proclamation  9466  of  June  30,  2016,  and  to  certain  goods  as 
recommended  in  Publications  3898  and  4653  of  the  Commission,  the  HTS 
is modified as set forth in Annex V. 

(7)  The  modifications  to  the  HTS  set  forth  in  Annexes  I,  IV,  and  V  to 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or with-
drawn  from  warehouse  for  consumption,  on  or  after  the  dates  set  forth 
in the relevant sections of Annexes I, IV, and V. 

(8)  Any  provisions  of  previous  proclamations  and  Executive  Orders  that 
are  inconsistent  with  the  actions  taken  in  this  proclamation  are  superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  June,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

34249 

Notice  of  July  20,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Transnational  Criminal  Organizations 

I  hereby  withdraw  the  notice  ‘‘Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency 
with  Respect  to  Transnational  Criminal  Organizations,’’  submitted  on  July 
19, 2017, and submit in lieu thereof the following: 
On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national 
emergency  with  respect  to  transnational  criminal  organizations  pursuant 
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706) 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities 
of the significant transnational criminal organizations. 
The activities of significant transnational criminal organizations have reached 
such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international polit-
ical and economic systems. Such organizations are increasingly sophisticated 
and  dangerous  to  the  United  States;  they  are  increasingly  entrenched  in 
the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, 
thereby  weakening  democratic  institutions,  degrading  the  rule  of  law,  and 
undermining  economic  markets.  These  organizations  facilitate  and  aggravate 
violent  civil  conflicts  and  increasingly  facilitate  the  activities  of  other  dan-
gerous persons. 
The  activities  of  significant  transnational  criminal  organizations  continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national 
emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13581  of  July  24,  2011,  and  the 
measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue 
in effect beyond July 24, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for

Title  3— 

The  President

34597 

Executive  Order  13806  of  July  21,  2017 

Assessing  and  Strengthening  the  Manufacturing  and  Defense 
Industrial  Base  and  Supply  Chain  Resiliency  of  the  United 
States 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  A  healthy  manufacturing  and  defense  industrial  base  and 
resilient  supply  chains  are  essential  to  the  economic  strength  and  national 
security  of  the  United  States.  The  ability  of  the  United  States  to  maintain 
readiness,  and  to  surge  in  response  to  an  emergency,  directly  relates  to 
the  capacity,  capabilities,  and  resiliency  of  our  manufacturing  and  defense 
industrial  base  and  supply  chains.  Modern  supply  chains,  however,  are 
often  long  and  the  ability  of  the  United  States  to  manufacture  or  obtain 
goods  critical  to  national  security  could  be  hampered  by  an  inability  to 
obtain  various  essential  components,  which  themselves  may  not  be  directly 
related to national security. Thus, the United States must maintain a manufac-
turing  and  defense  industrial  base  and  supply  chains  capable  of  manufac-
turing or supplying those items. 
The loss of more than 60,000 American factories, key companies, and almost 
5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000 threatens to undermine the capacity 
and  capabilities  of  United  States  manufacturers  to  meet  national  defense 
requirements  and  raises  concerns  about  the  health  of  the  manufacturing 
and  defense  industrial  base.  The  loss  of  additional  companies,  factories, 
or  elements  of  supply  chains  could  impair  domestic  capacity  to  create, 
maintain,  protect,  expand,  or  restore  capabilities  essential  for  national  secu-
rity. 
As  the  manufacturing  capacity  and  defense  industrial  base  of  the  United 
States  have  been  weakened  by  the  loss  of  factories  and  manufacturing  jobs, 
so  too  have  workforce  skills  important  to  national  defense.  This  creates 
a  need  for  strategic  and  swift  action  in  creating  education  and  workforce 
development programs and policies that support job growth in manufacturing 
and the defense industrial base. 
Strategic  support  for  a  vibrant  domestic  manufacturing  sector,  a  vibrant 
defense industrial base, and resilient supply chains is therefore a significant 
national priority. A comprehensive evaluation of the defense industrial base 
and  supply  chains,  with  input  from  multiple  executive  departments  and 
agencies  (agencies),  will  provide  a  necessary  assessment  of  our  current 
strengths and weaknesses. 
Sec.  2.  Assessment  of  the  Manufacturing  Capacity,  Defense  Industrial  Base, 
and  Supply  Chain  Resiliency  of  the  United  States.  Within  270  days  of 
the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  Defense,  in  coordination  with  the 
Secretaries  of  Commerce,  Labor,  Energy,  and  Homeland  Security,  and  in 
consultation  with  the  Secretaries  of  the  Interior  and  Health  and  Human 
Services,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  the  Director 
of  National  Intelligence,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  National  Security 
Affairs,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Economic  Policy,  the  Director 
of  the  Office  of  Trade  and  Manufacturing  Policy,  and  the  heads  of  such 
other  agencies  as  the  Secretary  of  Defense  deems  appropriate,  shall  provide 
to  the  President  an  unclassified  report,  with  a  classified  annex  as  needed, 
that builds on current assessment and evaluation activities, and:

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.)  (IEEPA),  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1601  et  seq.),  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United 
States Code, 
I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  in  order 
to  take  additional  steps  with  respect  to  the  national  emergency  declared 
in  Executive  Order  13692  of  March  8,  2015,  and  particularly  in  light  of

ezuela;  rampant  public  corruption;  and  ongoing  repression  and  persecution 
of,  and  violence  toward,  the  political  opposition,  hereby  order  as  follows: 
Section  1.  (a)  All  transactions  related  to,  provision  of  financing  for,  and

or  equal  to  90  or  30  days  as  covered  by  subsections  (a)(i)  or  (a)(ii)  of 
this section, respectively, is prohibited. 

(c) The prohibitions in subsections (a) and (b) of this section apply except

(c)  the  term  ‘‘United  States  person’’  means  any  United  States  citizen,

provisions of this order. 
Sec. 5. For those persons whose property or interests in property are affected 
by this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States,

neously,  prior  notice  to  such  persons  of  measures  to  be  taken  pursuant

that  for  these  measures  to  be  effective  in  addressing  the  national  emergency 
declared  in  Executive  Order  13692,  there  need  be  no  prior  notice  of  a 
listing or determination made pursuant to this order. 
Sec.  6.  This  order  is  not  intended  to,  and  does  not,  create  any  right  or 
benefit,  substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any 
party  against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,  its 
officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. 
Sec.  7.  This  order  is  effective  at  12:01  a.m.  eastern  daylight  time  on  August 
25, 2017.

Executive  Order  13793  of  April  27,  2017 

Improving  Accountability  and  Whistleblower  Protection  at 
the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  This  order  is  intended  to  improve  accountability  and 
whistleblower  protection  at  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  by 
directing  the  Secretary  of  Veterans  Affairs  (Secretary)  to  establish  within 
the  VA  an  Office  of  Accountability  and  Whistleblower  Protection  and  to 
appoint  a  Special  Assistant  to  serve  as  Executive  Director  of  the  Office. 
Sec. 2. Establishing a VA Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protec-
tion. (a) Within 45 days of the date of this order, and to the extent permitted 
by  law,  the  Secretary  shall  establish  in  the  VA  the  Office  of  Accountability 
and Whistleblower Protection (Office), and shall appoint a Special Assistant, 
reporting  directly  to  the  Secretary,  to  serve  as  Executive  Director  of  the 
Office.  The  VA  shall  provide  funding  and  administrative  support  for  the 
Office,  consistent  with  applicable  law  and  subject  to  the  availability  of 
appropriations. 

(b) To the extent permitted by law, the Office shall: 
(i)  advise  and  assist  the  Secretary  in  using,  as  appropriate,  all  available 
authorities  to  discipline  or  terminate  any  VA  manager  or  employee  who 
has  violated  the  public’s  trust  and  failed  to  carry  out  his  or  her  duties 
on  behalf  of  veterans,  and  to  recruit,  reward,  and  retain  high-performing 
employees; 
(ii)  identify  statutory  barriers  to  the  Secretary’s  authority  to  discipline 
or  terminate  any  employee  who  has  jeopardized  the  health,  safety,  or 
well-being of a veteran, and to recruit, reward, and retain high-performing 
employees;  and  report  such  barriers  to  the  Secretary  for  consideration 
as to the need for legislative changes; 
(iii)  work  closely  with  relevant  VA  components  to  ensure  swift  and  effec-
tive  resolution  of  veterans’  complaints  of  wrongdoing  at  the  VA;  and 
(iv)  work  closely  with  relevant  VA  components  to  ensure  adequate  inves-
tigation  and  correction  of  wrongdoing  throughout  the  VA,  and  to  protect 
employees who lawfully disclose wrongdoing from retaliation. 
(c)  In  establishing  the  Office,  the  Secretary  shall  consider,  in  addition 

to any other relevant factors: 

(i) whether some or all of the functions of the Office are currently performed 
by an existing VA office, component, or program; 
(ii)  whether  certain  administrative  capabilities  necessary  for  operating  the 
Office  are  redundant  with  those  of  another  VA  office,  component,  or 
program; and 
(iii)  whether  combining  the  Office  with  another  VA  office,  component, 
or  program  may  improve  the  VA’s  efficiency,  effectiveness,  or  account-
ability. 

Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency,

Executive  Order  13726  of  April  19,  2016 

Blocking  Property  and  Suspending  Entry  Into  the  United 
States  of  Persons  Contributing  to  the  Situation  in  Libya 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.)  (IEEPA),  the  National  Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), section 5 of the United Nations Participa-
tion  Act  of  1945,  as  amended  (22  U.S.C.  287c)  (UNPA),  section  212(f)  of 
the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act  of  1952  (8  U.S.C.  1182(f)),  and  section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, 
I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  hereby 
expand  the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13566  of  February  25,  2011,  finding  that  the  ongoing  violence  in  Libya, 
including  attacks  by  armed  groups  against  Libyan  state  facilities,  foreign 
missions in Libya, and critical infrastructure, as well as human rights abuses, 
violations of the arms embargo imposed by United Nations Security Council 
Resolution  1970  (2011),  and  misappropriation  of  Libya’s  natural  resources 
threaten  the  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  democratic  transition, 
and  territorial  integrity  of  Libya,  and  thereby  constitute  an  unusual  and 
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United 
States. To address this threat, and in view of United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions  2174  of  August  27,  2014,  and  2213  of  March  27,  2015,  I  hereby 
order: 
Section  1.  (a)  All  property  and  interests  in  property  that  are  in  the  United 
States,  that  hereafter  come  within  the  United  States,  or  that  are  or  hereafter 
come  within  the  possession  or  control  of  any  United  States  person  of  the 
following  persons  are  blocked  and  may  not  be  transferred,  paid,  exported, 
withdrawn,  or  otherwise  dealt  in:  any  person  determined  by  the  Secretary 
of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State: 

(i)  to  be  responsible  for  or  complicit  in,  or  to  have  engaged  in,  directly 
or indirectly, any of the following: 

(A)  actions  or  policies  that  threaten  the  peace,  security,  or  stability 

of Libya, including through the supply of arms or related materiel; 

(B)  actions  or  policies  that  obstruct,  undermine,  delay,  or  impede,  or 
pose a significant risk of obstructing, undermining, delaying, or impeding, 
the adoption of or political transition to a Government of National Accord 
or a successor government; 

(C)  actions  that  may  lead  to  or  result  in  the  misappropriation  of  state 

assets of Libya; or 

(D)  threatening  or  coercing  Libyan  state  financial  institutions  or  the 

Libyan National Oil Company; 
(ii) to be planning, directing, or committing, or to have planned, directed, 
or  committed,  attacks  against  any  Libyan  state  facility  or  installation  (in-
cluding oil facilities), against any air, land, or sea port in Libya, or against 
any foreign mission in Libya; 
(iii)  to  be  involved  in,  or  to  have  been  involved  in,  the  targeting  of

stitute  a  serious  abuse  or  violation  of  human  rights  or  a  violation  of 
international humanitarian law; 
(iv)  to  be  involved  in,  or  to  have  been  involved  in,  the  illicit  exploitation 
of  crude  oil  or  any  other  natural  resources  in  Libya,  including  the  illicit 
production,  refining,  brokering,  sale,  purchase,  or  export  of  Libyan  oil;

in  addition  to  export  control  authorities  implemented  by  the  Department

entry  into  the  United  States  of  aliens  determined  to  meet  one  or  more

interests  of  the  United  States,  and  I  hereby  suspend  entry  into  the  United 
States,  as  immigrants  or  nonimmigrants,  of  such  persons.  Such  persons 
shall  be  treated  as  persons  covered  by  section  1  of  Proclamation  8693  of 
July  24,  2011  (Suspension  of  Entry  of  Aliens  Subject  to  United  Nations 
Security Council Travel Bans and International Emergency Economic Powers

to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property 
are  blocked  pursuant  to  section  1  of  this  order  would  seriously  impair 
my  ability  to  deal  with  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13566  and  expanded  in  this  order,  and  I  hereby  prohibit  such  donations 
as provided by section 1 of this order. 
Sec.  4.  The  prohibitions  in  section  1  of  this  order  include  but  are  not 
limited to:

(c)  the  term  ‘‘United  States  person’’  means  any  United  States  citizen, 
permanent  resident  alien,  entity  organized  under  the  laws  of  the  United 
States  or  any  jurisdiction  within  the  United  States  (including  foreign 
branches), or any person in the United States. 

(d) the term ‘‘Government of National Accord or a successor government’’ 

means: 

(i)  a  Government  of  National  Accord  formed  pursuant  to  the  terms  of 
the  Libyan  Political  Agreement  signed  in  Skhirat,  Morocco,  on  December 
17, 2015, or any amendments thereto; 
(ii) a governmental authority formed under the Libyan Constitution pursu-
ant  to  the  terms  of  the  Libyan  Political  Agreement  signed  in  Skhirat, 
Morocco, on December 17, 2015, or any amendments thereto; 
(iii)  any  subdivision,  agency,  or  instrumentality  of  the  foregoing,  and 
any  partnership,  association,  corporation,  or  other  organization  owned 
or  controlled,  directly  or  indirectly,  by,  or  acting  for  or  on  behalf  of, 
the foregoing; or 
(iv)  any  other  person  determined  by  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  to 
be included within paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. 

Sec.  7.  For  those  persons  whose  property  and  interests  in  property  are 
blocked  pursuant  to  this  order  who  might  have  a  constitutional  presence 
in  the  United  States,  I  find  that  because  of  the  ability  to  transfer  funds 
or  other  assets  instantaneously,  prior  notice  to  such  persons  of  measures 
to  be  taken  pursuant  to  this  order  would  render  those  measures  ineffectual. 
I  therefore  determine  that  for  these  measures  to  be  effective  in  addressing 
the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13566  and  expanded 
in  this  order,  there  need  be  no  prior  notice  of  a  listing  or  determination 
made pursuant to section 1 of this order. 
Sec.  8.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary 
of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation 
of  rules  and  regulations,  and  to  employ  all  powers  granted  to  the  President 
by  IEEPA  and  the  UNPA,  as  may  be  necessary  to  carry  out  the  purposes 
of  this  order.  The  Secretary  of  the  Treasury  may  redelegate  any  of  these 
functions  to  other  officers  and  agencies  of  the  United  States  Government 
consistent with applicable law. All agencies of the United States Government 
are  hereby  directed  to  take  all  appropriate  measures  within  their  authority 
to carry out the provisions of this order.

Proclamation  9418  of  April  8,  2016 

The  President 

National  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Week,  2016 

22013 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  the  aftermath  of  a  crime,  it  is  imperative  that  victims  have  access  to 
the resources they need to recover and to ensure that justice is done. During 
the  35th  National  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Week,  we  stand  with  victims  and 
their  families,  and  we  strive  to  ensure  every  person—regardless  of  age, 
color,  or  creed—who  is  victimized  by  crime  knows  they  are  protected, 
respected, and heard. 
Certain  populations  are  more  vulnerable  to  crime,  and  my  Administration 
is  committed  to  defending  the  rights  of  crime  victims  everywhere  and  safe-
guarding  their  access  to  essential  resources  and  services.  Violence  against 
women,  including  sexual  assault,  domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  and 
stalking,  is  too  prevalent  in  our  society,  and  we  will  continue  doing  every-
thing we can to shine a light on these crimes wherever they exist, including 
on  our  campuses  and  in  our  military.  We  are  taking  action  to  reduce  the 
number  of  untested  rape  kits  in  America—critical  tools  that  can  deliver 
justice  for  victims  in  the  wake  of  an  assault—and  the  Department  of  Justice 
issued  new  guidance  to  prevent  gender  bias  when  responding  to  cases  of 
sexual assault and domestic violence. Additionally, the My Brother’s Keeper 
initiative  is  working  to  reduce  violence  and  secure  second  chances  for 
our  youth  to  ensure  all  young  people—including  those  from  communities 
disproportionately  affected  by  violent  crime—have  the  opportunities  and 
resources they need to reach their full potential. 
A  victim’s  immediate  interactions  after  a  crime  are  often  with  the  law 
enforcement  officials  who  are  the  first  to  respond.  In  2014,  I  created  the 
President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing (Task Force), and in addition 
to  promoting  ways  to  enhance  public  safety  across  America,  the  Task  Force 
issued recommendations to strengthen public trust between local law enforce-
ment  and  communities,  which  increases  the  likelihood  that  victims  and 
witnesses will cooperate with law enforcement after a crime. My Administra-
tion  will  also  continue  working  to  support  the  most  vulnerable  among  us 
who  are  subject  to  heinous  crimes—including  children  who  are  forced  into 
sex  trafficking  and  denied  their  inherent  human  rights,  and  seniors  who, 
in too many cases, are exposed to abuse, neglect, and exploitation. 
When  a  crime  does  occur,  we  owe  it  to  those  who  suffer  in  its  aftermath 
to uplift them and stand beside them. This week, as we honor those dedicated 
to  ensuring  services  and  support  are  available  for  victims  of  crime,  let 
us  rededicate  ourselves  to  protecting  crime  victims’  rights  and  upholding 
the  basic  belief  that  all  people  should  be  able  to  live  safely  and  free  from 
fear, violence, and intimidation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  10  through 
April  16,  2016,  as  National  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Week.  I  call  upon  all 
Americans  to  observe  this  week  by  participating  in  events  that  raise  aware-
ness  of  victims’  rights  and  services,  and  by  volunteering  to  serve  victims 
in their time of need.

Proclamation  9450  of  May  18,  2016 

National  Hepatitis  Testing  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  the  United  States,  hepatitis  A,  B,  and  C  are  the  most  common  types 
of viral hepatitis—affecting between 3.5 and 6.9 million people and claiming 
the  lives  of  thousands  of  our  fellow  Americans  each  year.  Because  of  the 
persistent efforts of researchers, advocates, and so many others in the medical 
and  public  health  communities,  we  have  made  great  strides  in  advancing 
treatment  of  and  finding  cures  for  viral  hepatitis.  Individuals  living  with 
hepatitis  B  and  C  can  only  benefit  from  these  advances  if  they  are  tested 
and  made  aware  of  their  disease.  On  National  Hepatitis  Testing  Day,  we 
reaffirm  the  importance  of  educating  people  about  viral  hepatitis,  and  we 
encourage  individuals  at  risk  for  hepatitis  B  and  hepatitis  C  to  get  tested. 
More  than  half  of  Americans  living  with  viral  hepatitis  are  unaware  of 
their  infection  status.  This  lack  of  awareness  contributes  to  an  increasing 
number of infections and deaths that could be prevented by people receiving 
the  care  and  treatment  they  need.  When  left  undiagnosed  and  untreated, 
viral  hepatitis  can  cause  serious  damage  to  the  liver—it  is  the  leading 
cause  of  liver  cancer  and  the  most  common  reason  for  liver  transplantation. 
Symptoms  of  viral  hepatitis  can  go  undetected  for  many  years,  which  is 
why  it  is  important  to  receive  vaccines  for  hepatitis  A  and  B,  and  blood 
tests for hepatitis B and C—measures that can be life-saving for those living 
with  this  disease.  I  urge  all  Americans  to  visit  www.CDC.gov/Hepatitis  for 
more information. 
Prevention  and  early  detection  are  key  to  combating  viral  hepatitis,  and 
my Administration remains dedicated to ensuring all Americans have access 
to  the  quality,  affordable  health  care  they  deserve.  The  Affordable  Care 
Act requires coverage of recommended services that can help prevent, detect, 
and  treat  viral  hepatitis—including  viral  hepatitis  vaccinations  and  testing. 
In  addition,  the  Act  prohibits  insurers  from  denying  coverage  to  anyone 
with  a  preexisting  condition,  like  viral  hepatitis.  We  have  also  released 
a  roadmap  for  ensuring  our  Federal  efforts  to  address  viral  hepatitis  are 
coordinated  and  focused  on  making  more  people  living  with  viral  hepatitis 
aware of their status. The Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment 
of  Viral  Hepatitis,  available  at  www.HHS.gov/Hepatitis,  spans  more  than 
20 Federal entities and it moves us toward increasing the number of people 
who  are  aware  of  their  infection  status,  reducing  the  number  of  new  cases 
of  hepatitis  C,  and  eliminating  the  transmission  of  hepatitis  B  between 
mother and child. 
I  have  proposed  funding  to  support  a  new  initiative  aimed  at  expanding 
testing  and  access  to  treatment  of  hepatitis  C  for  people  living  with  HIV 
and  to  advance  efforts  to  eliminate  hepatitis  C  transmission  and  deaths. 
Those  living  with  HIV  are  more  vulnerable  to  viral  hepatitis  infections, 
and African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and American 
Indians  and  Alaska  Natives  are  also  disproportionately  affected.  Viral  hepa-
titis infections, particularly among young people, can be reduced by address-
ing  the  heroin  epidemic  and  abuse  of  prescription  opioids—a  priority  for 
my Administration—and by ensuring that individuals who inject drugs have

orders.  We  have  taken  action  to  expand  access  to  treatment  and  increase 
community  prevention  strategies  so  more  Americans  can  get  the  help  they 
need. 
On  this  day,  let  us  rededicate  ourselves  to  ensuring  all  people  with  viral 
hepatitis  know  their  infection  status  and  have  access  to  necessary  care 
and resources. Let us honor those we have lost too soon, and let us recognize 
the  many  individuals  working  tirelessly  to  address  this  disease,  develop 
treatments, and save lives.

of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  19,  2016,  as 
National  Hepatitis  Testing  Day.  I  encourage  citizens,  Government  agencies, 
non-profit organizations, and communities across the Nation to join in activi-
ties  that  will  increase  awareness  about  viral  hepatitis  and  the  need  for 
expanded testing. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  eighteenth  day 
of  May,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the  Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

ance,  risk  management,  information  technology  (IT),  privacy,  identity  man-
agement, Internet governance and standards, government administration, dig-
ital  and  social  media,  communications,  or  any  other  area  determined  by 
the  President  to  be  of  value  to  the  Commission.  The  Speaker  of  the  House 
of  Representatives,  the  Minority  Leader  of  the  House  of  Representatives, 
the  Majority  Leader  of  the  Senate,  and  the  Minority  Leader  of  the  Senate 
are each invited to recommend one individual for membership on the Com-
mission.  No  federally  registered  lobbyist  or  person  presently  otherwise  em-
ployed by the Federal Government may serve on the Commission. 

(b)  The  President  shall  designate  one  member  of  the  Commission  to  serve 
as  the  Chair  and  one  member  of  the  Commission  to  serve  as  the  Vice 
Chair. 
Sec. 3. Mission and Work. The Commission will make detailed recommenda-
tions  to  strengthen  cybersecurity  in  both  the  public  and  private  sectors 
while  protecting  privacy,  ensuring  public  safety  and  economic  and  national 
security,  fostering  discovery  and  development  of  new  technical  solutions, 
and  bolstering  partnerships  between  Federal,  State,  and  local  government

use  technology  and  approach  cybersecurity  as  consumers  and  providers 
in the digital economy; demonstrate the nature and severity of cybersecurity 
threats,  the  importance  of  mitigation,  and  potential  ways  to  manage  and 
reduce the economic impacts of cyber risk; improve access to the knowledge 
needed to make informed cyber risk management decisions related to privacy, 
economic  impact,  and  business  continuity;  and  develop  partnerships  with 
industry,  civil  society,  and  international  stakeholders.  At  a  minimum,  the 
Commission shall develop recommendations regarding: 

(i)  how  best  to  bolster  the  protection  of  systems  and  data,  including 
how  to  advance  identity  management,  authentication,  and  cybersecurity

Proclamation  9455  of  May  31,  2016 

African-American  Music  Appreciation  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
A vital part of our Nation’s proud heritage, African-American music exempli-
fies  the  creative  spirit  at  the  heart  of  American  identity  and  is  among 
the  most  innovative  and  powerful  art  the  world  has  ever  known.  It  accom-
panies  us  in  our  daily  lives,  and  it  has  rung  out  at  turning  points  in 
our  history  and  demonstrated  how  our  achievements  as  a  culture  go  hand- 
in-hand  with  our  progress  as  a  Nation.  During  African-American  Music 
Appreciation  Month,  we  honor  the  artists  who,  through  this  music,  bring 
us  together,  show  us  a  true  reflection  of  ourselves,  and  inspire  us  to  reach 
for the harmony that lies beyond our toughest struggles. 
Songs by African-American musicians span the breadth of the human experi-
ence  and  resonate  in  every  corner  of  our  Nation—animating  our  bodies, 
stimulating  our  imaginations,  and  nourishing  our  souls.  In  the  ways  they 
transform  real  stories  about  real  people  into  art,  these  artists  speak  to  uni-
versal  human  emotion  and  the  restlessness  that  stirs  within  us  all.  African- 
American  music  helps  us  imagine  a  better  world,  and  it  offers  hope  that 
we will get there together. 
This  month,  we  celebrate  the  music  that  reminds  us  that  our  growth  as 
a  Nation  and  as  people  is  reflected  in  our  capacity  to  create  great  works 
of  art.  Let  us  recognize  the  performers  behind  this  incredible  music,  which 
has  compelled  us  to  stand  up—to  dance,  to  express  our  faith  through  song, 
to  march  against  injustice,  and  to  defend  our  country’s  enduring  promise 
of freedom and opportunity for all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as African- 
American Music Appreciation Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate 
activities and programs that raise awareness and foster appreciation of music 
that is composed, arranged, or performed by African Americans.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9516  of  October  6,  2016 

National  Manufacturing  Day,  2016 

70591 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Since  our  earliest  days,  innovation  has  been  one  of  the  most  important 
driving  forces  of  the  American  economy,  and  for  generations,  our  manufac-
turing  industry  was  the  ticket  to  a  good  middle-class  life.  Over  time,  devel-
oping technology has changed the way we approach manufacturing. American 
manufacturing  lost  roughly  one-third  of  its  jobs  in  the  first  decade  of  the 
new  century—during  the  global  recession—and  the  middle  class  paid  the 
price. Despite that, in recent years, through the determination of our resilient 
workforce,  our  economy  and  our  manufacturing  industry  have  been  on  the 
rise.  Since  2010,  we  have  added  more  than  800,000  manufacturing  jobs 
and witnessed the fastest pace of manufacturing job growth since the 1990s— 
and  today,  factories  are  opening  doors  more  quickly  than  at  any  time  in 
the  past  20  years.  On  National  Manufacturing  Day,  we  celebrate  American 
manufacturing  and  recognize  our  potential  to  remain  competitive  by  con-
tinuing  to  strengthen  research,  development,  and  our  manufacturing  sector. 

To  build  on  this  progress,  we  must  keep  America  on  the  cutting  edge 
of  innovation  and  attract  more  high-quality  manufacturing  jobs  for  workers 
to  fill  in  the  21st-century  economy.  We  have  worked  to  grow  the  jobs 
of  tomorrow  through  Manufacturing  USA,  a  national  network  of  manufac-
turing  hubs  that  bring  businesses,  research  universities,  and  governments 
together  to  co-invest  in  the  development  of  world-leading  manufacturing 
technologies  and  capabilities.  These  manufacturing  hubs  not  only  enable 
some  of  the  best  minds  in  America  to  work  together,  but  they  also  create 
a  home  for  specific  technology  focus  areas  in  manufacturing  that  attract 
people  from  around  the  world.  Government  can  and  should  play  a  role 
in  catalyzing  this  progress,  which  is  why  my  Administration  has  already 
announced nine manufacturing hubs, with even more planned in the future. 
By  supporting  this  network  of  global  leadership  in  manufacturing,  we  are 
ensuring a steady stream of good jobs and pursuing the potential to fundamen-
tally  change  the  way  we  build  things  in  America.  I  encourage  everyone 
to  visit  www.Manufacturing.gov  to  learn  more  about  the  ways  we  have 
highlighted  these  partnerships  to  increase  our  competitiveness  and  advance 
our national manufacturing infrastructure. 

The  growing  maker  movement  has  played  a  role  in  encouraging  manufac-
turing.  Through  our  Nation  of  Makers  initiative,  we  have  worked  to  give 
students,  entrepreneurs,  and  all  Americans  access  to  new  technologies  so 
they can design and build anything they can dream of. The democratization 
of tools required to create products has been critical for supporting entrepre-
neurship  and  has  led  to  a  renaissance  of  American  manufacturing—and 
we  must  continue  to  foster  the  culture  of  making  and  entrepreneurship. 
Our economic competitiveness in domestic manufacturing depends on critical 
investments in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. 
If  we  make  the  necessary  investments  to  help  students  and  young  people 
experience  hands-on  STEM  learning,  we  can  spark  a  deep  interest  and 
help  them  develop  the  passion  and  creativity  they  need  to  excel  in  the 
21st-century economy.

Each  year,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  observe  this  day  by  attending 
open  houses,  public  tours,  and  career  workshops.  As  we  mark  5  years 
since the first National Manufacturing Day, we must inspire the next genera-
tion  of  workers  and  innovators  to  seek  careers  in  manufacturing.  Let  us 
continue working to strengthen and expand the manufacturing jobs of tomor-
row  and  ensure  that  opportunity  for  all  is  something  we  can  keep  making 
in America for generations to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  7,  2016, 
as  National  Manufacturing  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States 
to observe this day with programs and activities that highlight the contribu-
tions  of  American  manufacturers,  and  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  visit 
a manufacturer in their local community. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  sixth  day  of 
October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9539  of  November  8,  2016 

Veterans  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
America  has  long  stood  as  a  beacon  of  hope  and  opportunity,  and  few 
embody  that  spirit  here  at  home  and  beyond  our  borders  more  than  the 
members of our Armed Forces. Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast 
Guardsmen are part of an unbroken chain of brave patriots who have served 
our  country  with  honor  and  made  tremendous  sacrifices  so  that  we  may 
live free. On Veterans Day, we salute the women and men who have proudly 
worn  the  uniform  of  the  United  States  of  America  and  the  families  who 
have  served  alongside  them,  and  we  affirm  our  sacred  duty  as  citizens 
to  express  our  enduring  gratitude,  both  in  words  and  in  actions,  for  their 
service. 
Our  country  has  the  best-trained  and  best-equipped  military  force  in  the 
world, and we need to make sure we have the most supported and respected 
veterans  in  the  world.  We  are  a  Nation  that  leaves  no  one  behind,  and 
my Administration has made historic investments to provide veterans access 
to  the  resources  and  education  they  need  to  share  in  our  Nation’s  promise 
when they return home. Partnering with community leaders across America, 
First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  Dr.  Jill  Biden’s  Joining  Forces  initiative 
works  to  ensure  our  country’s  heroes  can  thrive  by  combatting  veteran 
homelessness, promoting their emotional well-being, and advancing employ-
ment  training  and  placement—and  we  have  made  great  progress.  Today, 
the  unemployment  rate  for  veterans  is  lower  than  the  national  average, 
and  veteran  homelessness  has  been  nearly  cut  in  half  since  2010.  We  also 
recognize  that  some  of  these  courageous  men  and  women  have  faced  and 
overcome  profound  challenges,  both  physically  and  emotionally,  in  defense 
of  our  freedom.  We  must  continue  to  provide  high  quality  health  care 
to  our  veterans  and  make  sure  they  have  the  support  they  have  earned 
and deserve. 
The  example  our  Nation’s  veterans  set  throughout  their  lives  is  a  testament 
to  the  drive  and  perseverance  that  define  the  American  character.  Let  us 
uphold  our  obligations  to  these  heroic  individuals  and  never  forget  those 
who  paid  the  ultimate  price  for  our  liberty.  On  this  day  and  throughout 
the year, may we sustain their lasting contributions to our Nation’s progress 
and  carry  forward  their  legacy  by  building  a  future  that  is  stronger,  safer, 
and freer for all. 
With respect for, and in recognition of, the contributions our service members 
have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress 
has  provided  (5  U.S.C.  6103(a))  that  November  11  of  each  year  shall  be 
set aside as a legal public holiday to honor our Nation’s veterans. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  11,  2016,  as  Veterans  Day.  I 
encourage all Americans to recognize the valor and sacrifice of our veterans 
through appropriate public ceremonies and private prayers, and by observing 
2  minutes  of  silence  for  our  Nation’s  veterans.  I  call  upon  Federal,  State, 
and  local  officials  to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  and  to  participate 
in patriotic activities in their communities. I call on all Americans, including

Proclamation  9395  of  February  12,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Mojave  Trails  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The Mojave Trails area of southern California is a stunning mosaic of rugged 
mountain  ranges,  ancient  lava  flows,  and  spectacular  sand  dunes.  It  is  a 
landscape  defined  by  scarcity  and  shaped  by  travel.  The  area  exemplifies 
the  remarkable  ecology  of  the  Mojave  Desert,  where  the  hearty  insistence 
of  life  is  scratched  out  from  unrelenting  heat  and  dryness.  This  punishing 
environment  has  also  forged  the  unique  human  history  of  the  area,  from 
ancient settlements uprooted by a changing climate to the armies of General 
George S. Patton, Jr., as they trained for battle in North Africa. With historic 
American  trading  routes,  trails  followed  by  Spanish  explorers,  a  trans-
continental  rail  line,  and  the  Nation’s  most  famous  highway,  the  Mojave 
Trails area tells the American story of exploration, migration, and commerce. 
The  Mojave  Trails  area  is  an  invaluable  treasure  and  will  continue  to  serve 
as an irreplaceable national resource for geologists, ecologists, archaeologists, 
and historians for generations to come. 
The  Mojave  Trails  area  has  been  a  focus  of  geological  research  for  decades. 
This unique landscape contains a stunning diversity of lava flows, mountains, 
playas,  sand  dunes,  bajadas,  washes,  and  other  features.  The  area  contains 
a number of significant sand dune features, most notably the stunning Cadiz 
Dunes,  which  have  been  extensively  studied.  The  mountains  of  the  Mojave 
Trails  area  include  several  significant  formations,  and  seismologists  have 
studied  this  area  for  insight  into  faulting,  tectonics,  and  magmatism.  A 
number  of  young  volcanoes  and  their  associated  lava  flows  in  the  area 
have  been  heavily  studied  by  volcanologists.  Amboy  Crater,  designated  as 
a  National  Natural  Landmark  in  1973,  has  been  the  focus  of  research  on 
a  number  of  volcanic  phenomena.  The  Pisgah  Volcano  lava  flow’s  vast 
network  of  lava  tubes  constitutes  southern  California’s  highest  density  of 
caves,  and  is  used  by  both  speleologists  and  recreational  cavers.  The  area’s 
terrain  and  geology  have  provided  a  surrogate  for  lunar  and  Martian  land-
scapes,  and  many  of  the  robotic  and  imaging  technologies  used  to  better 
understand volcanism and Aeolian processes have been developed and tested 
in the Mojave Trails area. 
Outstanding  paleontological  resources  can  be  found  throughout  the  Mojave 
Trails area. The Cady Mountains contain important fossil fauna assemblages 
dating to the Miocene Period. The Marble Mountain Fossil Bed area contains 
one  of  the  classic  Cambrian  trilobite  fossil  sites  in  the  Western  United 
States.  Set  in  the  green-brown  lower  Cambrian  Latham  Shale,  the  fossil 
beds  also  contain 
fossilized  remains  of  brachiopods,  mollusks, 
echinoderms,  and  algal  bodies  that  are  of  great  interest  to  paleontologists. 
The southern Bristol Mountains contain Tertiary fossils such as camel tracks, 
invertebrates,  and  numerous  plants;  this  fossil  history  has  also  been  used 
to understand the climate history of the Mojave Desert. Significant vertebrate 
fossils  and  other  fossil  resources  have  also  been  identified  in  Piute  Valley 
and  Cadiz  Valley  as  well  as  the  Ship  Mountains,  Little  Piute  Mountains, 
and Sacramento Mountains. 
The Mojave Trails area has been important for ecological research, including 
studies  on  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  land  management  practices

on  ecological  communities  and  wildlife.  It  provides  opportunity  for  further 
research  on  ecological  connectivity  in  the  Mojave  Desert  region,  as  it  is 
among the most ecologically intact areas in southern California. The species 
that have managed to thrive here are specialists in perseverance and resource-
fulness and are remarkable for their ability to withstand the desert extremes. 
The  area’s  scarce  springs  and  riparian  areas  such  as  Afton  Canyon, 
Chuckwalla  Spring,  Hummingbird  Spring,  Barrel  Spring,  and  Fenner  Spring 
provide  refuges  for  a  wide  variety  of  plants  and  animals.  The  complex 
network  of  groundwater  underlying  the  Mojave  Trails  area  has  been  the 
subject  of  past  and  ongoing  hydrological  study.  Underground  aquifers  feed 
springs  and  seeps  that  are  important  for  sensitive  ecosystems  and  wildlife, 
though specific connections are not yet well understood. 
Rare  plant  species  such  as  the  scrub  lotus,  rosy  two-tone  beardtongue, 
whitemargin  beardtongue,  Emory’s 
small-flowered 
androstephium,  white-margined  penstemon,  and  Borrego  milkvetch  rely  on 
the  specific  habitat  types  found  in  the  Mojave  Trails  area.  The  Piute  Valley 
area  in  the  northeastern  part  of  the  Mojave  Trails  area  is  home  to  the 
northernmost  occurrences  of  smoke  trees  in  the  California  desert,  as  well 
as  the  Homer  Mountain  Ocotillo  Assemblage.  The  lowlands  and  middle 
elevations  are  also  home  to  other  unique  or  ecologically  significant  plants 
such  as  the  endemic  Orocopia  Mountains  spurge.  Numerous  cactus  species 
are  also  found  here,  including  the  densest  concentration  of  Bigelow  cholla 
cactus in California. Ongoing research in the Mojave Trails area has identified 
other  plant  species  that  are  new  to  science,  many  of  which  have  not  yet 
been described. 
Birds  including  the  endangered  Least  Bell’s  vireo,  southwestern  willow 
flycatcher,  and  yellow-billed  cuckoo  depend  on  this  area,  as  do  raptors 
such as the burrowing owl, red-tailed hawk, golden eagle, American kestrel, 
and  prairie  falcon.  Fragile  desert  fish  species  such  as  the  bonytail  chub 
rely  on  the  scarce  waters  of  the  desert  riparian  ecosystems.  A  wide  variety 
of  fascinating  native  mammal  species  can  be  found  in  the  Mojave  Trails 
area,  including  the  kit  fox,  ringtail,  American  badger,  mountain  lion,  and 
bighorn sheep. Reptiles and amphibians, including the Mojave Desert’s largest 
lizard,  the  chuckwalla,  have  been  extensively  studied  in  the  Mojave  Trails 
area.  The  area  contains  some  of  the  Mojave  Desert’s  best  habitat  for  the 
threatened  desert  tortoise  and  provides  important  dispersal  corridors  for 
that  fragile  species.  An  unusual  community  of  invertebrates  associated  with 
lava tubes in the Pisgah area offers an ongoing opportunity for entomological 
research. 
Humans  have  lived  in  and  moved  through  the  Mojave  Trails  area  for  more 
than  10,000  years.  The  archeological  record  tells  of  a  human  existence 
shaped  by  a  changing  climate.  During  the  Paleo-Indian  period,  now-dry 
lakes  provided  fresh  water  to  small  groups  of  nomadic  people  and  the 
animals  they  hunted.  From  around  7,000  to  2,000  BC,  rising  temperatures 
resulted  in  a  change  from  wet  to  dry  conditions.  Associated  ecological 
changes  in  the  region  led  to  new  patterns  of  subsistence  for  native  peoples. 
Although  people  remained  closely  tied  to  water  sources  following  the  tem-
perature increase, desert inhabitants adjusted their diets to rely more heavily 
on  plants  and  fish,  invented  new  tools,  and  expanded  the  sizes  of  their 
social groups. During the Formative Period (2,500 to 1,500 BC), dry conditions 
meant  the  inhabitants  of  the  Mojave  Desert  remained  in  small  groups.  They 
relied  heavily  for  their  survival  on  the  Mojave  River,  a  name  derived  from 
the  traditional  name  for  these  people,  Pipa  Aha  Macav  (‘‘the  people  by 
the  river’’).  The  Mojave  people  left  their  mark  on  the  landscape  through 
petroglyphs,  pictographs,  old  trails,  and  stone  work,  some  of  which  can 
still be found today, especially near springs and rivers and along the shores 
of now-extinct lakes. 
The Mojave were not the only people to use or pass through this landscape. 
Ancestors of the Chemehuevi Indian Tribe, a branch of the Southern Paiute, 
have  been  persistent  occupants  of  the  Mojave  Desert  for  thousands  of  years.

Sacred Chemehuevi trails are often tied to traditional and ceremonial songs. 
The  Salt  Song  Trail,  one  of  the  longest  song  trails  of  the  Chemehuevi 
people,  passes  through  the  Mojave  Trails  area  near  the  town  of  Fenner 
and  the  Ward  Valley.  Natural  land  patterns  form  the  route  of  this  trail, 
with  specific  songs  sung  at  specific  wayside  locations.  Other  Native  Ameri-
cans  who  have  lived  in  or  passed  through  the  Mojave  Desert  include  the 
Shoshone,  Serrano,  Kawaiisu,  and  the  Paiute.  The  Ward  Valley,  located 
between  the  Old  Woman  and  Piute  Mountains,  is  sacred  to  a  number  of 
these  tribes,  as  are  the  Mesquite  and  Crucero  Hills,  which  contain  over 
50  archaeological  sites  including  petroglyphs,  milling  stations,  temporary 
camps,  intaglios,  lithic  scatters,  and  pottery  dating  as  far  back  as  4,000 
years. 
The  Mojave  Trails  area  has  been  a  critical  travel  corridor  for  millennia, 
linking  the  Pacific  Coast  to  the  deserts  of  the  southwest  and  beyond.  The 
Mojave  Indian  Trail  is  the  earliest  known  travel  route  passing  through  the 
Mojave  Trails  area,  used  by  Native  Americans  for  thousands  of  years  and 
by  early  Spanish  explorers  and  traders.  In  1829,  Mexican  explorer  Antonio 
Armijo  pioneered  the  Old  Spanish  Trail  through  this  area.  Evidence  of 
the  trail,  now  designated  a  National  Historic  Trail,  can  still  be  found  at 
Afton Canyon. 
By  the  end  of  the  19th  century,  transcontinental  rail  travel  had  changed 
the American West in profound ways. In 1882, Southern Pacific constructed 
a  railroad  route  from  Barstow  to  Needles.  In  addition  to  the  major  rail 
stops  established  at  Needles  and  Barstow,  several  smaller  towns  and  rail 
stops were established along this stretch, including the alphabetically named 
Amboy, Bristol, Cadiz, Danby, Essex, Fenner, and Goffs. These towns remain, 
some  as  inhabited  hamlets  and  others  as  abandoned  ghost  towns,  and  some 
historical  artifacts  from  the  original  rail  line  still  exist,  including  original 
rail  ties  and  track  and  later  improvements  of  communications  poles, 
insulators, and wires. 
A modest dirt road—an original trackside component of the railroad project— 
would  later  become  the  most  famous  highway  in  America.  In  1911,  in 
the  infancy  of  the  automobile  era,  the  County  of  San  Bernardino  paved 
the  first  stretch  of  that  road  from  Barstow  to  Needles.  The  next  year,  this 
stretch  became  part  of  the  National  Old  Trails  Road,  which  extended  more 
than  3,000  miles  from  New  York,  New  York,  to  Los  Angeles,  California, 
and  connected  the  American  coasts  by  pavement  for  the  first  time.  In  1926, 
the  road  was  officially  designated  as  U.S.  Highway  66,  a  designation  soon 
known  around  the  world  as  Route  66.  During  the  1930s,  Route  66  became 
an  important  route  for  migrants  escaping  economic  hardships  of  the  Great 
Depression  and  droughts  in  the  Central  plains.  As  the  national  economy 
rebounded  following  World  War  II,  Americans  took  to  the  highways  in 
unprecedented  numbers.  The  road  became  an  American  icon,  earning  the 
nickname  the  ‘‘Main  Street  of  America’’  and  inspiring  popular  culture 
through music, literature, and film. 
The  popularity  of  Route  66,  however,  hastened  its  downfall;  increasing 
traffic quickly exceeded its two-lane capacity. In 1985, Route 66 was officially 
decommissioned,  leaving  behind  a  powerful  albeit  fragmented  narrative  his-
tory  of  America’s  automobile  culture  of  the  first  half  of  the  20th  century 
and  its  legacy  of  related  commerce  and  architecture.  The  Mojave  Trails 
area contains the longest remaining undeveloped stretch of Route 66, offering 
spectacular and serene desert vistas and a glimpse into what travelers experi-
enced  during  the  peak  of  the  route’s  popularity  in  the  mid-20th  century. 
Today,  the  ghost  towns  along  this  stretch  of  Route  66  are  a  visual  legacy 
of how the automobile shaped the American landscape. 
In  addition  to  its  important  role  in  the  transportation  history  of  the  United 
States,  the  Mojave  Trails  area  is  a  unique  resource  for  understanding  one 
of  the  most  formative  periods  in  American  military  history.  During  the 
height  of  World  War  II,  the  United  States  military  recognized  a  need  to 
develop  a  desert  training  program  in  order  to  prepare  its  troops  to  fight

the  tank  armies  of  Nazi  Germany  in  North  Africa.  Major  General  George 
S.  Patton,  Jr.,  commander  of  the  I  Armored  Corps,  selected  the  site  of 
the  Desert  Training  Center  in  the  Mojave  Trails  area,  the  largest  training 
area  in  the  world  at  the  time.  More  than  one  million  troops  trained  in 
the  area  between  1942  and  1944,  including  at  Camp  Ibis,  Camp  Clipper, 
Camp  Iron  Mountain,  Camp  Granite,  and  Camp  Essex.  Remnants  of  these 
camps  can  still  be  found  today,  including  rock-lined  streets,  staging  areas, 
flag  circles,  altars,  tent  areas,  and  even  tank  tracks  on  some  of  the  area’s 
hardpan playas. 
The protection of the Mojave Trails area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, 
and  historic  legacy  and  maintain  its  diverse  array  of  natural  and  scientific 
resources,  ensuring  that  the  prehistoric,  historic,  and  scientific  values  of 
this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  in  all  cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  objects  of  scientific 
and historic interest on the Mojave Trails lands; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal Government to be the Mojave Trails National Monument (monument) 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  part  thereof 
all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map,  which 
is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal 
lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately  1.6  million  acres. 
The  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map  are  confined  to  the 
smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects 
to be protected. 
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monu-
ment  are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from  all  forms  of  entry,  loca-
tion,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the  public  land  laws,  from 
location,  entry,  and  patent  under  the  mining  laws,  and  from  disposition 
under  all  laws  relating  to  mineral  and  geothermal  leasing,  other  than  by 
exchange  that  furthers  the  protective  purposes  of  the  monument  or  disposal 
for  the  limited  purpose  of  providing  materials  for  repairing  or  maintaining 
roads  and  bridges  within  the  monument  consistent  with  care  and  manage-
ment of the objects identified above. 
The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  If

or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved 
as  a  part  of  the  monument,  and  objects  identified  above  that  are  situated 
upon  those  lands  and  interests  in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument, 
upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government. 
The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument through

Executive  Order  13744  of  October  13,  2016 

Coordinating  Efforts  To  Prepare  the  Nation  for  Space  Weath-
er  Events 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  to  prepare  the  Nation  for  space 
weather events, it is hereby ordered as follows: 

Section  1.  Policy.  Space  weather  events,  in  the  form  of  solar  flares,  solar 
energetic particles, and geomagnetic disturbances, occur regularly, some with 
measurable  effects  on  critical  infrastructure  systems  and  technologies,  such 
as the Global Positioning System (GPS), satellite operations and communica-
tion, aviation, and the electrical power grid. Extreme space weather events— 
those  that  could  significantly  degrade  critical  infrastructure—could  disable 
large  portions  of  the  electrical  power  grid,  resulting  in  cascading  failures 
that would affect key services such as water supply, healthcare, and transpor-
tation.  Space  weather  has  the  potential  to  simultaneously  affect  and  disrupt 
health  and  safety  across  entire  continents.  Successfully  preparing  for  space 
weather events is an all-of-nation endeavor that requires partnerships across 
governments, emergency managers, academia, the media, the insurance indus-
try, non-profits, and the private sector. 

It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  prepare  for  space  weather  events 
to  minimize  the  extent  of  economic  loss  and  human  hardship.  The  Federal 
Government  must  have  (1)  the  capability  to  predict  and  detect  a  space 
weather  event,  (2)  the  plans  and  programs  necessary  to  alert  the  public 
and  private  sectors  to  enable  mitigating  actions  for  an  impending  space 
weather event, (3) the protection and mitigation plans, protocols, and stand-
ards  required  to  reduce  risks  to  critical  infrastructure  prior  to  and  during 
a  credible  threat,  and  (4)  the  ability  to  respond  to  and  recover  from  the 
effects of space weather. Executive departments and agencies (agencies) must 
coordinate  their  efforts  to  prepare  for  the  effects  of  space  weather  events. 

Sec.  2.  Objectives.  This  order  defines  agency  roles  and  responsibilities  and 
directs  agencies  to  take  specific  actions  to  prepare  the  Nation  for  the  haz-
ardous  effects  of  space  weather.  These  activities  are  to  be  implemented 
in  conjunction  with  those  identified  in  the  2015  National  Space  Weather 
Action  Plan  (Action  Plan)  and  any  subsequent  updates.  Implementing  this 
order  and  the  Action  Plan  will  require  the  Federal  Government  to  work 
across  agencies  and  to  develop,  as  appropriate,  enhanced  and  innovative 
partnerships with State, tribal, and local governments; academia; non-profits; 
the  private  sector;  and  international  partners.  These  efforts  will  enhance 
national  preparedness  and  speed  the  creation  of  a  space-weather-ready  Na-
tion. 

Sec. 3. Coordination. (a) The Director of the Office of Science and Technology 
Policy (OSTP), in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Home-
land Security and Counterterrorism and the Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB), shall coordinate the development and implementa-
tion of Federal Government activities to prepare the Nation for space weather 
events,  including  the  activities  established  in  section  5  of  this  order  and 
the  recommendations  of  the  National  Science  and  Technology  Council 
(NSTC), established by Executive Order 12881 of November 23, 1993 (Estab-
lishment of the National Science and Technology Council).

Executive  Order  13717  of  February  2,  2016 

Establishing  a  Federal  Earthquake  Risk  Management  Stand-
ard 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  the  Earthquake  Hazards 
Reduction  Act  of  1977,  as  amended,  and  section  121(a)  of  title  40,  United 
States  Code,  and  to  improve  the  Nation’s  resilience  to  earthquakes,  I  hereby 
direct the following: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  strengthen  the 
security  and  resilience  of  the  Nation  against  earthquakes,  to  promote  public 
safety,  economic  strength,  and  national  security.  To  that  end,  the  Federal 
Government  must  continue  to  take  proactive  steps  to  enhance  the  resilience 
of  buildings  that  are  owned,  leased,  financed,  or  regulated  by  the  Federal 
Government. When making investment decisions related to Federal buildings, 
each executive department and agency (agency) responsible for implementing 
this  order  shall  seek  to  enhance  resilience  by  reducing  risk  to  the  lives 
of  building  occupants  and  improving  continued  performance  of  essential 
functions  following  future  earthquakes.  The  Federal  Government  recognizes 
that  building  codes  and  standards  primarily  focus  on  ensuring  minimum 
acceptable  levels  of  earthquake  safety  for  preserving  the  lives  of  building 
occupants.  To  achieve  true  resilience  against  earthquakes,  however,  new 
and  existing  buildings  may  need  to  exceed  those  codes  and  standards  to 
ensure, for example, that the buildings can continue to perform their essential 
functions  following  future  earthquakes.  Agencies  are  thus  encouraged  to 
consider  going  beyond  the  codes  and  standards  set  out  in  this  order  to 
ensure that buildings are fully earthquake resilient. 
Sec.  2.  Requirements  for  Earthquake  Safety  of  New  Federal  Buildings,  Im-
provements  to  Existing  Federal  Buildings,  and  Federally  Leased,  Financed, 
or Regulated Buildings. 

(a)  New  Buildings  and  Alterations  to  Existing  Buildings.  Each  agency 
responsible for the design and construction of a new building or an alteration 
to an existing building shall ensure that the building is designed, constructed, 
or  altered,  respectively,  in  accord  with  appropriate  earthquake-resistant  de-
sign  and  construction  codes  and  standards  as  set  forth  in  sections  3(a) 
and 3(b) of this order. 

(b)  Space  Leased  for  Federal  Occupancy.  Each  agency  responsible  for 
the  lease  of  a  building  shall,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  ensure  that 
it  leases  only  buildings  that  have  been  designed  and  constructed  in  accord 
with  the  appropriate  earthquake-resistant  design  and  construction  standards 
that  apply  to  the  type  of  lease  at  issue,  as  set  forth  in  section  3(c)  of 
this order. 

(c)  Federal  Assistance  Programs.  Each  agency  assisting  in  the  financing, 
through  Federal  grants  or  loans,  or  guaranteeing  the  financing,  through  loan 
or  mortgage  insurance  programs,  of  a  newly  constructed  building  shall  con-
sider  updating  its  procedures  for  providing  the  assistance  to  be  consistent 
with  section  3(a)  of  this  order,  to  assure  appropriate  consideration  of  earth-
quake safety. 

(d)  Federally  Regulated  Buildings.  Each  agency  with  responsibility  for 
regulating the structural safety of a new building shall consider using earth-
quake-resistant  design  and  construction  standards  for  the  new  building  con-
sistent with section 3(a) of this order.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  24 / Friday,  February  5,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

Sec.  3.  Codes,  Standards,  and  Concurrent  Requirements.  (a)  Commencing 
within  90  days  after  the  date  of  this  order,  each  agency  shall  ensure  that 
every  new  building  for  which  the  agency  has  not  started  programming 
is in compliance with the earthquake-resistant design provisions of the 2015 
editions of the International Building Code (IBC) or the International Residen-
tial  Code  (IRC),  nationally  recognized  building  codes  promulgated  by  the 
International  Code  Council  (ICC),  or  equivalent  codes,  consistent  with  the 
provisions  of  and  to  the  extent  required  by  40  U.S.C.  3312.  When  the 
ICC  releases  a  new  version  of  the  IRC  or  IBC,  each  agency  that  constructs 
buildings shall determine whether the new version is a nationally recognized 
code  for  the  purposes  of  40  U.S.C.  3312(b),  as  expeditiously  as  practicable, 
but  not  later  than  2  years  after  the  release  of  the  new  version.  If  an  agency 
determines  that  a  new  version  is  a  nationally  recognized  code,  it  shall 
ensure that any building, for which the agency has not started programming, 
shall be in compliance with that new version or an equivalent code. 

(b)  Each  agency  that  owns  an  existing  Federal  building  shall  adopt  the 
Standards of Seismic Safety for Existing Federally Owned and Leased Build-
ings  (Standards),  which  are  developed,  issued,  and  maintained  by  the  Inter-
agency  Committee  on  Seismic  Safety  in  Construction  (ICSSC),  as  the  min-
imum  level  acceptable  for  managing  the  earthquake  risks  in  that  building. 
Any  agency  that  has  not  adopted  the  Standards  at  the  time  of  this  order 
shall  adopt  the  Standards  no  later  than  90  days  from  the  date  of  this 
order.  All  agencies  shall  adopt  subsequent  editions  of  the  Standards  as 
expeditiously  as  practicable,  but  no  later  than  2  years  following  their 
issuance. 

(c)  Each  agency  that  leases  space  in  an  existing  building  shall  adopt 
the Standards as the minimum level acceptable for managing the earthquake 
risks  in  that  building.  This  requirement  shall  apply  to  existing  leases  or 
leases  existing  at  the  time  of  issuance  of  updated  Standards  only  to  the 
extent  appropriate,  as  determined  by  the  leasing  agency.  With  respect  to 
leases  for  a  building  being  constructed  to  accommodate  a  Federal  agency 
under  the  authority  in  40  U.S.C.  585(a),  the  leasing  agency  shall  ensure

ensure  that  the  building  complies  with  the  earthquake-resistant  design  and 
construction  standards  that  would  apply  to  a  building  constructed  by  the 
agency  pursuant  to  section  3(a)  of  this  order,  to  the  extent  permitted  by 
law.

tute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST),  shall  lead  the  ICSSC,  and  shall 
lead  the  development  and  maintenance  of  ICSSC  guidelines  to  assist  the 
Federal  agencies  with  implementing  earthquake  risk  reduction  measures 
in their construction programs. 

(b)  Agencies  whose  activities  are  covered  by  this  order  shall  designate 
one  or  more  Seismic  Safety  Coordinator(s)  to  serve  as  focal  points  for  the 
agency’s  compliance  with  this  order  and  to  participate  in  the  ICSSC  as 
appropriate.  Within  30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  each  agency  shall 
identify its Seismic Safety Coordinator(s) to the Director of NIST. 

(c) The Director of NIST, on behalf of the ICSSC, shall issue implementing

Proclamation  9492  of  September  14,  2016 

To  Modify  Duty-Free  Treatment  Under  the  Generalized  Sys-
tem  of  Preferences 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  Section  502  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974,  as  amended  (the  ‘‘1974  Act’’) 
(19  U.S.C.  2462),  authorizes  the  President  to  designate  countries  as  bene-
ficiary  developing  countries,  and  to  designate  any  beneficiary  developing 
country  as  a  least-developed  beneficiary  developing  country,  for  purposes 
of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program. Section 502(f)(1)(A) 
of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2462(f)(1)(A))  requires  the  President  to  notify 
the  Congress  before  designating  any  country  as  a  beneficiary  developing 
country. Section 502(f)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(1)(B)) requires 
the  President  to  notify  the  Congress  at  least  60  days  before  designating 
any country as a least-developed beneficiary developing country. 
2.  Pursuant  to  section  502(a)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  taking  into  account 
the  factors  set  forth  in  section  502(c)  (19  U.S.C.  2462(c)),  I  have  determined 
that  the  suspension  pursuant  to  Proclamation  5955  of  April  13,  1989,  of 
preferential  treatment  for  Burma  as  a  beneficiary  developing  country  under 
the GSP program should be ended, and I will so notify the Congress. 
3.  Pursuant  to  section  502(a)(2)  of  the  1974  Act,  and  having  considered 
the  factors  set  forth  in  sections  501  (19  U.S.C.  2461)  and  502(c),  I  have 
also determined that Burma should be designated as a least-developed bene-
ficiary  developing  country  for  purposes  of  the  GSP  program,  and  I  will 
so notify the Congress. 
4.  Section  604  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2483),  as  amended,  authorizes 
the  President  to  embody  in  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  (HTS)  of  the 
United  States  the  substance  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  and 
of  other  Acts  affecting  import  treatment,  and  actions  thereunder,  including 
removal,  modification,  continuance,  or  imposition  of  any  rate  of  duty  or 
other import restriction. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Barack  Obama,  President  of  the  United  States  of 
America,  acting  under  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and 
the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  title  V  and  section 
604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461–67, 2483), do proclaim that: 

(1)  In  order  to  reflect  in  the  HTS  the  restoration  of  preferential  treatment 
for  Burma  as  a  beneficiary  developing  country  under  the  GSP  program, 
general  note  4(a)  is  modified  by  adding  in  alphabetical  order  ‘‘Burma’’ 
to the list entitled ‘‘Independent Countries’’ and to the list entitled ‘‘Member 
Countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).’’ 

(2)  In  order  to  reflect  in  the  HTS  the  designation  of  Burma  as  a  least- 
developed  beneficiary  developing  country  under  the  GSP  program,  general 
note 4(b)(i) is modified by adding in alphabetical order ‘‘Burma.’’ 

(3)  The  modifications  to  the  HTS  made  by  paragraphs  (1)  and  (2)  of 
this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or with-
drawn  from  warehouse  for  consumption,  on  or  after  the  date  that  is  60 
days after the date of this proclamation.

Proclamation  9497  of  September  16,  2016 

Constitution  Day  and  Citizenship  Day,  Constitution  Week, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Tasked with the awesome responsibility of building a Government to endure 
for generations to come, a band of dedicated patriots gathered in Philadelphia 
in  1787,  seeking  to  build  a  more  stable  and  permanent  framework  for  a 
nascent  democracy.  Passionate  debates  and  intense  negotiation  gave  way 
to  lasting  compromise,  and  a  document  emerged  that  became  the  bedrock 
of  America.  Signed  on  September  17,  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States 
has steered our country through ever-changing times. It guides us as leaders 
on  the  world  stage  and  safeguards  the  fundamental  rights  of  our  citizens. 
And  it  guarantees  that  the  greatness  of  our  Nation  never  depends  on  any 
one  person—it  requires  the  full  and  active  participation  of  an  engaged  and 
vibrant citizenry. 
The  vision  of  self-government  laid  out  in  our  Constitution  is  dependent 
on  Americans  doing  the  hard  and  sometimes  frustrating—yet  always  essen-
tial—work  of  citizenship.  Being  a  citizen  is  a  responsibility  that  challenges 
each  of  us  to  stay  informed,  to  speak  out  when  something  is  not  right 
or  not  just,  and  to  come  together  to  shape  the  course  our  country  will 
take.  Citizenship  is  a  commitment,  calling  on  us  to  stand  up  for  what 
we  believe  in  and  to  exercise  our  rights  to  protect  the  rights  of  others. 
The Bill of Rights and other amendments added in the decades that followed 
have  paved  the  way  for  progress,  and  they  embody  a  truth  held  since 
our  founding:  the  simple  but  powerful  idea  that  people  who  love  their 
country can change it for the better. 
America  is  more  than  a  piece  of  land—it  is  an  idea,  a  place  where  we 
can  contribute  our  talents,  fulfill  our  ambitions,  and  be  part  of  something 
bigger than ourselves. Each year on Citizenship Day, we celebrate our newest 
citizens who raise their hands and swear a sacred oath to join our American 
family.  The  journey  they  have  taken  reminds  us  that  immigration  is  our 
origin story. For centuries, immigrants have brought diverse beliefs, cultures, 
languages,  and  traditions  to  our  country,  and  they  have  pledged  to  uphold 
the ideals expressed in our founding documents. They come from all around 
the  world,  mustering  faith  that  in  America,  they  can  build  a  better  life 
and  give  their  children  something  more.  That  is  why  I  was  proud  to  create 
the  White  House  Task  Force  on  New  Americans,  which  is  helping  to  build 
welcoming  communities  around  our  country  and  enhance  civic,  economic, 
and  linguistic  integration  for  immigrants  and  refugees.  Through  the  Task 
Force, Federal agencies and local communities are working together to raise 
awareness  about  the  rights,  responsibilities,  and  opportunities  of  citizen-
ship—and  to  give  immigrants  and  refugees  the  tools  they  need  to  succeed. 
As  a  Nation  of  immigrants,  our  legacy  is  rooted  in  their  success.  Their 
contributions  help  us  live  up  to  our  founding  principles.  With  pride  in 
our  diverse  heritage  and  in  our  common  creed,  we  affirm  our  dedication 
to  the  values  enshrined  in  our  Constitution.  We,  the  people,  must  forever 
breathe  life  into  the  words  of  this  precious  document,  and  together  ensure 
that its principles endure for generations to come.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  184 / Thursday,  September  22,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

In  remembrance  of  the  signing  of  the  Constitution  and  in  recognition  of 
the Americans who strive to uphold the duties and responsibilities of citizen-
ship,  the  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  of  February  29,  1952  (36  U.S.C. 
106),  designated  September  17  as  ‘‘Constitution  Day  and  Citizenship  Day,’’ 
and  by  joint  resolution  of  August  2,  1956  (36  U.S.C.  108),  requested  that 
the  President  proclaim  the  week  beginning  September  17  and  ending  Sep-
tember 23 of each year as ‘‘Constitution Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  17,  2016,  as  Constitution  Day 
and  Citizenship  Day,  and  September  17  through  September  23,  2016,  as 
Constitution  Week.  I  encourage  Federal,  State,  and  local  officials,  as  well 
as  leaders  of  civic,  social,  and  educational  organizations,  to  conduct  cere-
monies  and  programs  that  bring  together  community  members  to  reflect 
on  the  importance  of  active  citizenship,  recognize  the  enduring  strength 
of our Constitution, and reaffirm our commitment to the rights and obligations 
of citizenship in this great Nation. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  sixteenth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Presidential  Determination  No.  2017–01  of  November  14,  2016 

Presidential  Determination  Pursuant  to  Section  1245(d)(4)(B) 
and  (C)  of  the  National  Defense  Authorization  Act  for  Fiscal 
Year  2012 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury[, 
and]  the  Secretary  of  Energy 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States,  after  carefully  considering  the  reports  submitted 
to  the  Congress  by  the  Energy  Information  Administration  including  the 
report  of  September  7,  2016,  and  other  relevant  factors,  including  global 
economic conditions, increased oil production by certain countries, the level 
of  spare  capacity,  and  the  availability  of  strategic  reserves,  I  determine, 
pursuant to section 1245(d)(4)(B) and (C) of the National Defense Authoriza-
tion  Act  for  Fiscal  Year  2012,  Public  Law  112–81,  and  consistent  with 
my  prior  determinations,  that  there  is  a  sufficient  supply  of  petroleum 
and petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a significant 
reduction  in  the  volume  of  petroleum  and  petroleum  products  purchased 
from  Iran  by  or  through  foreign  financial  institutions.  However,  consistent 
with U.S. commitments specified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action 
(JCPOA),  the  United  States  is  no  longer  pursuing  efforts  to  reduce  Iran’s 
sales  of  crude  oil.  The  United  States  action  to  fulfill  these  commitments 
became effective upon reaching Implementation Day under the JCPOA, which 
occurred  once  the  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  verified  that  Iran 
had implemented key nuclear-related steps specified in the JCPOA to ensure 
that its nuclear program is and will remain exclusively peaceful. 
I will continue to monitor this situation closely.

14683 

Proclamation  9406  of  March  14,  2016 

To  Take  Certain  Actions  Under  the  African  Growth  and  Op-
portunity  Act 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

1.  In  Proclamation  7350  of  October  2,  2000,  the  President  designated  the 
Republic of South Africa (South Africa) as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
country  for  purposes  of  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974  (the 
‘‘1974 Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)(1)), as added by section 111(a) of the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 106–200) (AGOA). 

2. Sections 506A(d)(4)(C) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(d)(4)(C)) and 506A(c)(1) (19 U.S.C. 
2466a(c)(1))  of  the  1974  Act  authorize  the  President  to  suspend  the  applica-
tion  of  duty-free  treatment  provided  for  any  article  described  in  section 
506A(b)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2466a(b)(1))  or  19  U.S.C.  3721  with 
respect  to  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country  if  he  determines  that 
the beneficiary country is not meeting the requirements described in section 
506A(a)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  and  that  suspending  such  duty-free  treatment 
would  be  more  effective  in  promoting  compliance  by  the  country  with 
those  requirements  than  terminating  the  designation  of  the  country  as  a 
beneficiary  sub-Saharan  African  country  for  purposes  of  section  506A  of 
the 1974 Act. 

3.  In  Proclamation  9388  of  January  11,  2016,  pursuant  to  section  506A(c)(1) 
of the 1974 Act, I determined that South Africa was not meeting the require-
ments  described  in  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  1974  Act  and  that  suspending 
the application of duty-free treatment to certain goods would be more effec-
tive  in  promoting  compliance  by  South  Africa  with  such  requirements  than 
terminating  the  designation  of  South  Africa  as  a  beneficiary  sub-Saharan 
African  country.  Thus,  pursuant  to  section  506A(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act, 
I  suspended  the  application  of  duty-free  treatment  for  all  AGOA-eligible 
goods  in  the  agricultural  sector  from  South  Africa  for  purposes  of  section 
506A of the 1974 Act, effective on March 15, 2016. 

4.  Pursuant  to  section  506A  of  the  1974  Act,  based  on  actions  that  the 
Government  of  South  Africa  has  taken  to  come  into  compliance  with  the 
requirements  described  in  section  506A(a)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  I  have  deter-
mined  that  suspending  the  application  of  duty-free  treatment  to  certain 
goods  is  no  longer  necessary  to  promote  compliance  by  South  Africa  with 
such requirements. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  but  not  limited 
to  sections  506A(d)(4)(C)  and  506A(c)(1)  of  the  1974  Act,  do  proclaim  that: 

(1) Proclamation 9388 of January 11, 2016, is hereby revoked. 

(2)  Any  provisions  of  previous  proclamations  and  Executive  Orders  that 
are  inconsistent  with  the  actions  taken  in  this  proclamation  are  superseded 
to the extent of such inconsistency.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9473  of  August  5,  2016 

National  Health  Center  Week,  2016 

52965 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Across  America,  community  health  centers  offer  affordable,  high-quality 
health  care  to  people  regardless  of  their  financial  status.  For  more  than 
50  years,  underserved  communities  and  vulnerable  populations  have  relied 
on  the  primary  and  preventive  care  options  these  centers  provide.  During 
National  Health  Center  Week,  we  reflect  on  the  important  role  that  health 
centers have played in delivering the comprehensive care all people deserve. 

With  a  strong  focus  on  community-based  and  patient-centered  care,  health 
centers  offer  more  than  just  treatment  for  illnesses  and  injuries;  through 
an  emphasis  on  education  and  prevention,  they  promote  wellness  and  help 
people  lead  healthier  lives.  Anyone  seeking  care  can  locate  their  nearest 
community  health  center  by  using  the  ‘‘Find  a  Health  Center’’  tool  at 
www.HRSA.gov. Health centers have also played an important part in imple-
menting  the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA).  In  addition  to  giving  20  million 
more  Americans  the  peace  of  mind  of  having  quality,  affordable  health 
insurance,  the  ACA  has  enabled  health  centers  to  add  more  than  950  new 
service  delivery  sites  across  our  country.  Today,  nearly  1,400  health  centers 
operate approximately 9,800 service delivery sites and provide care for nearly 
23 million patients. 

Health  centers  are  an  important  part  of  our  Nation’s  health  care  system, 
and  my  Administration  remains  committed  to  supporting  these  facilities 
and the care they deliver. This year, we invested $94 million to help health 
centers  treat  people  suffering  from  substance  use  disorders—including  pre-
scription opioid abuse and heroin use. We have also made new investments 
to  build  and  renovate  health  center  facilities  across  our  country  to  help 
serve  more  patients  and  increase  availability  of  oral  health  services.  And 
because  America’s  health  centers  are  uniquely  positioned  to  address  certain 
public health challenges, we have increased funding to expand critical serv-
ices  in  communities  that  need  them  most.  We  have  made  key  investments 
to  help  health  centers  respond  to  the  water  crisis  in  Flint,  Michigan,  and 
combat  the  growing  threat  from  the  Zika  virus  in  Puerto  Rico,  the  U.S. 
Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. 

This week, let us thank the dedicated professionals in our community health 
centers  who  provide  quality  care  at  affordable  prices.  Let  us  build  on  their 
efforts to improve the well-being of our people and together continue working 
to bring about a stronger, healthier Nation for all. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  the  week  of  August 
7  through  August  13,  2016,  as  National  Health  Center  Week.  I  encourage 
all  Americans  to  celebrate  this  week  by  visiting  their  local  health  center, 
meeting  health  center  providers,  and  exploring  the  programs  they  offer  to 
help keep families healthy.

The  President 

Presidential Documents

42215 

Proclamation  9465  of  June  24,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Stonewall  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Christopher  Park,  a  historic  community  park  located  immediately  across 
the  street  from  the  Stonewall  Inn  in  the  Greenwich  Village  neighborhood 
of  New  York  City  (City),  is  a  place  for  the  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and 
transgender (LGBT) community to assemble for marches and parades, expres-
sions  of  grief  and  anger,  and  celebrations  of  victory  and  joy.  It  played 
a  key  role  in  the  events  often  referred  to  as  the  Stonewall  Uprising  or 
Rebellion,  and  has  served  as  an  important  site  for  the  LGBT  community 
both before and after those events. 
As  one  of  the  only  public  open  spaces  serving  Greenwich  Village  west 
of  6th  Avenue,  Christopher  Park  has  long  been  central  to  the  life  of  the 
neighborhood  and  to  its  identity  as  an  LGBT-friendly  community.  The  park 
was  created  after  a  large  fire  in  1835  devastated  an  overcrowded  tenement 
on  the  site.  Neighborhood  residents  persuaded  the  City  to  condemn  the 
approximately  0.12-acre  triangle  for  public  open  space  in  1837.  By  the 
1960s,  Christopher  Park  had  become  a  popular  destination  for  LGBT  youth, 
many  of  whom  had  run  away  from  or  been  kicked  out  of  their  homes. 
These  youth  and  others  who  had  been  similarly  oppressed  felt  they  had 
little to lose when the community clashed with the police during the Stone-
wall Uprising. 
In  the  early  morning  hours  of  June  28,  1969,  a  riot  broke  out  in  response 
to  a  police  raid  on  the  Stonewall  Inn,  at  the  time  one  of  the  City’s  best 
known LGBT bars. Over the course of the next several days, more demonstra-
tions  and  riots  occurred  in  the  surrounding  neighborhood  including  Chris-
topher  Park.  During  these  days,  because  of  its  strategic  location  across  from 
the  bar,  Christopher  Park  served  as  a  gathering  place,  refuge,  and  platform 
for the community to voice its demand for LGBT civil rights. The Stonewall 
Uprising is considered by many to be the catalyst that launched the modern 
LGBT  civil  rights  movement.  From  this  place  and  time,  building  on  the 
work  of  many  before,  the  Nation  started  the  march—not  yet  finished— 
toward securing equality and respect for LGBT people. 
Christopher  Park  and  its  environs  have  remained  a  key  gathering  place 
for  the  LGBT  community.  For  example,  on  June  26,  2015,  within  moments 
of the issuance of the Supreme Court’s historic ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, 
LGBT people headed to Christopher Park to celebrate the Court’s recognition 
of  a  constitutional  right  to  same-sex  marriage.  A  few  days  later,  Governor 
Cuomo  continued  that  celebration  by  officiating  at  the  marriage  of  two 
gay  men  directly  outside  the  Stonewall  Inn.  Within  minutes  of  the  recent 
news  of  the  murders  of  49  people  in  a  nightclub  in  Orlando,  Florida— 
one  of  the  most  deadly  shootings  in  American  history—LGBT  people  and 
their  supporters  in  New  York  headed  again  to  Christopher  Park  to  mourn, 
heal,  and  stand  together  in  unity  for  the  fundamental  values  of  equality 
and dignity that define us as a country. 
Today,  Christopher  Park  is  surrounded  by  brick  sidewalks  and  a  nineteenth 
century  wrought-iron  fence  with  gated  openings.  Educational  signs  about 
the  Stonewall  Uprising  are  found  near  the  large  arched  main  entryway. 
Divided  into  two  halves,  the  western  side  of  the  park  is  open  to  the  public

on  a  daily  basis  and  contains  a  small  plaza  lined  with  brick  pavers  and 
benches.  George  Segal’s  sculpture,  ‘‘Gay  Liberation,’’  stands  as  a  focal  point 
of the plaza. The sculpture was commissioned in 1979 on the tenth anniver-
sary  of  the  Stonewall  Uprising,  and  its  installation  in  1992  cemented  Chris-
topher  Park’s  role  as  a  destination  for  those  wishing  to  understand  the 
significance of the Stonewall Uprising. The eastern half of the park contains 
two structures erected in 1936: a statue of Civil War General Philip Sheridan, 
and  a  memorial  flagstaff  and  plaque  honoring  Colonel  Ephraim  Elmer  Ells-
worth,  an  officer  with  the  New  York  Fire  Zouaves  during  the  Civil  War. 
Across  the  street  from  Christopher  Park  is  the  target  of  the  June  28,  1969, 
police  raid,  the  Stonewall  Inn  (51–53  Christopher  Street),  originally  built 
in  1843  and  1846  as  two  separate  two-story  horse  stables.  In  1930,  the 
two  buildings  were  combined  into  one  commercial  space  with  a  new  single 
exterior  facade.  In  1934,  the  first-floor  space  opened  as  a  restaurant  called 
Bonnie’s  Stonewall  Inn,  which  served  the  neighborhood  for  over  30  years. 
The  restaurant  closed  in  1966,  but  was  reopened  in  1967  as  an  LGBT 
bar called the Stonewall Inn. 
The  streets  and  sidewalks  in  the  neighborhood  surrounding  Christopher 
Park and the Stonewall Inn are an integral part of the neighborhood’s historic 
character and played a significant role in the Stonewall Uprising. The narrow 
streets  bend,  wrap  back  on  themselves,  and  otherwise  create  directional 
havoc. In the early 1800s, the residents rejected the City’s attempts to enlarge 
the  neighborhood  streets  and  align  them  with  the  City’s  grid  plan,  and 
the  extension  of  Seventh  Avenue  South  through  the  area  in  the  early  1900s 
only added confusion. During the Stonewall Uprising, this labyrinthine street 
pattern  helped  the  LGBT  demonstrators,  who  knew  the  neighborhood,  to 
evade riot-control police, who were not from the local precinct. 
Viewed  from  Christopher  Park’s  central  location,  this  historic  landscape— 
the park itself, the Stonewall Inn, the streets and sidewalks of the surrounding 
neighborhood—reveals  the  story  of  the  Stonewall  Uprising,  a  watershed 
moment  for  LGBT  civil  rights  and  a  transformative  event  in  the  Nation’s 
civil  rights  movement  on  par  with  the  1848  Women’s  Rights  Convention 
at  Seneca  Falls  and  the  1965  Selma-to-Montgomery  March  for  voting  rights 
in  its  role  in  energizing  a  broader  community  to  demand  equal  rights. 
Although  the  1960s  were  a  time  of  social  and  political  change  that  brought 
greater  freedom  to  many  segments  of  society,  these  new-found  freedoms 
did  not  extend  to  members  of  the  LGBT  community.  They  faced  increased 
oppression and criminal prosecution even for being physically intimate with 
consensual partners. In New York City, LGBT people were frequently arrested 
for  acts  such  as  same-sex  dancing  and  kissing  and  wearing  clothes  of  the 
perceived  opposite  gender.  In  some  States,  adults  of  the  same  sex  caught 
having  consensual  sex  in  their  own  home  could  receive  sentences  of  up 
to  life  in  prison  or  be  confined  to  a  mental  institution,  where  they  faced 
horrific procedures, such as shock therapy, castration, and lobotomies. LGBT 
Americans  lived  their  lives  in  secrecy  for  fear  of  losing  their  jobs,  being 
evicted  from  their  homes,  or  being  arrested.  For  LGBT  people  of  color 
or living in poverty, life was especially challenging. 
For  over  a  century,  Greenwich  Village  has  attracted  Americans  of  all  kinds 
with  an  interest  in  political  activism  and  nonconformity.  By  the  1930s, 
Greenwich  Village  was  home  to  a  significant  LGBT  community.  Despite 
the  aggressive  anti-LGBT  policies  and  practices  that  emerged  in  the  City 
in  the  1950s  and  60s,  a  variety  of  bars,  nightclubs,  restaurants,  hotels, 
and  private  clubs  catered  to  an  LGBT  clientele.  Many  establishments  lasted 
only a few months before police raided them and shut them down, a practice 
that intensified during mayoral election years such as 1969. 
The police frequently raided LGBT bars for illegally selling alcoholic drinks 
to  ‘‘homosexuals.’’  LGBT  bars  operated  by  organized  crime  syndicates  often 
paid  off  members  of  the  police  force  and  in  return  received  tips  about 
when  raids  were  planned.  As  part  of  a  crackdown  on  LGBT  bars  in  June 
1969,  the  Public  Morals  squad  of  Manhattan’s  First  Police  Division  raided

the  Stonewall  Inn  on  June  24,  1969,  confiscated  its  liquor,  and  arrested 
its  employees.  The  Stonewall  Inn  reopened  the  next  day.  Having  made 
only  minimal  impact  with  this  raid,  the  police  decided  to  plan  a  surprise 
raid  for  the  following  Friday  night  or  Saturday  morning,  when  the  bar 
would be crowded. 
On June 28, 1969, undercover police officers raided the Stonewall Inn around 
1:15  a.m.,  after  one  of  them  witnessed  the  illegal  sale  of  alcohol.  Customers 
resisted  the  police  by  refusing  to  show  identification  or  go  into  a  bathroom 
so  that  a  police  officer  could  verify  their  sex.  As  police  officers  began 
making  arrests,  the  remaining  customers  gathered  outside  instead  of  dis-
persing  as  they  had  in  the  past.  They  cheered  when  friends  emerged  from 
the  bar  under  police  escort,  and  they  shouted  ‘‘Gay  Power!’’  and  ‘‘We  Want 
Freedom!’’. As word spread, the gathering grew in size and a riot ultimately 
ensued. Around 3:00 a.m., the City’s riot-control force appeared, and started 
to  push  the  crowd  away  from  the  Stonewall  Inn.  But  the  crowd  refused 
to  disperse.  Groups  of  demonstrators  retreated  to  nearby  streets,  only  to 
cut  back  and  regroup  near  the  Stonewall  Inn  and  Christopher  Park.  The 
riot  finally  abated  about  4:30  a.m.,  but  during  the  next  week  several  more 
protests  formed,  and  in  some  cases,  led  to  new  riots  and  confrontations 
with the police. 
The  Stonewall  Uprising  changed  the  Nation’s  history.  After  the  Stonewall 
incident,  the  LGBT  community  across  the  Nation  realized  its  power  to 
join  together  and  demand  equality  and  respect.  Within  days  of  the  events, 
Stonewall seemed to galvanize LGBT communities across the country, bring-
ing new supporters and inspiring LGBT activists to organize demonstrations 
to show support for LGBT rights in several cities. One year later, the number 
of  LGBT  organizations  in  the  country  had  grown  from  around  50  to  at 
least  1,500,  and  Pride  Marches  were  held  in  a  number  of  large  cities  to 
commemorate the Stonewall Uprising. 
The  quest  for  LGBT  equality  after  Stonewall  evolved  from  protests  and 
small  gatherings  into  a  nationwide  movement.  Lesbian  women,  gay  men, 
bisexual and transgender people united to ensure equal rights for all people 
regardless  of  their  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity.  Hard-fought  civil 
rights  victories  in  courtrooms  and  statehouses  across  the  country  set  the 
stage for victories in the Supreme Court that would have seemed unthinkable 
to those who rose up in Greenwich Village in June 1969. Today, communities, 
cities,  and  nations  celebrate  LGBT  Pride  Days  and  Months,  and  the  number 
of  Pride  events  approaches  1,000.  The  New  York  City  Police  Department 
now  has  an  LGBT  Liaison  Unit  to  build  positive  relations  with  the  LGBT 
community, and provides the community with expert protection when threats 
are identified. Most importantly, the Nation’s laws and jurisprudence increas-
ingly  reflect  the  equal  treatment  that  the  LGBT  community  deserves.  There 
is  important  distance  yet  to  travel,  but  through  political  engagement  and 
litigation,  as  well  as  individual  acts  of  courage  and  acceptance,  this  move-
ment has made tremendous progress toward securing equal rights and equal 
dignity. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  the  President’s  discretion, 
to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric 
structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  in  all  cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  in  2000,  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  (Secretary)  designated 
the Stonewall Inn, Christopher Park, and portions of the surrounding neigh-
borhood  as  a  National  Historic  Landmark  for  its  association  with  the  Stone-
wall Uprising, a momentous event that inspired a national LGBT civil rights 
movement;

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  125 / Wednesday,  June  29,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

WHEREAS, for the purpose of establishing a national monument to be admin-
istered  by  the  National  Park  Service,  the  City  of  New  York  has  donated 
to the Federal Government fee title to the approximately 0.12-acre Christopher 
Park; 

WHEREAS, the designation of a national monument at the site of the Stone-
wall  Uprising  would  elevate  its  message  and  story  to  the  national  stage 
and  ensure  that  future  generations  would  learn  about  this  turning  point 
that sparked changes in cultural attitudes and national policy towards LGBT 
people over the ensuing decades; 

WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  Christopher 
Park  and  the  historic  objects  associated  with  it  in  the  Stonewall  National 
Historic Landmark; 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Stonewall  National  Monument  (monument) 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  a  part  thereof 
all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map,  which 
is  attached  to  and  forms  a  part  of  this  proclamation.  The  reserved  Federal 
lands and interests in lands encompass approximately 0.12 acres. The bound-
aries  described  on  the  accompanying  map  are  confined  to  the  smallest 
area  compatible  with  the  proper  care  and  management  of  the  objects  to 
be protected. 

All  Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  within  the  boundaries  described 
on  the  accompanying  map  are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from 
all  forms  of  entry,  location,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the 
public  land  laws,  from  location,  entry,  and  patent  under  the  mining  laws, 
and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to  mineral  and  geothermal 
leasing. 

The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  If 
the  Federal  Government  acquires  any  lands  or  interests  in  lands  not  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved 
as  a  part  of  the  monument,  and  objects  identified  above  that  are  situated 
upon  those  lands  and  interests  in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument, 
upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government. 

The Secretary shall manage the monument through the National Park Service, 
pursuant  to  applicable  legal  authorities,  consistent  with  the  purposes  and 
provisions  of  this  proclamation.  The  Secretary  shall  prepare  a  management 
plan, with full public involvement and in coordination with the City, within 
3  years  of  the  date  of  this  proclamation.  The  management  plan  shall  ensure 
that  the  monument  fulfills  the  following  purposes  for  the  benefit  of  present 
and  future  generations:  (1)  to  preserve  and  protect  the  objects  of  historic 
interest  associated  with  the  monument,  and  (2)  to  interpret  the  monument’s 
objects,  resources,  and  values  related  to  the  LGBT  civil  rights  movement. 
The management plan shall, among other things, set forth the desired relation-
ship of the monument to other related resources, programs, and organizations, 
both within and outside the National Park System. 

The  National  Park  Service  is  directed  to  use  applicable  authorities  to  seek 
to  enter  into  agreements  with  others,  and  the  New  York  City  Department 
of Parks and Recreation in particular, to enhance public services and promote 
management efficiencies. 

Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation.

Proclamation  9531  of  October  28,  2016 

National  College  Application  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  America,  all  people  deserve  an  equal  chance  to  succeed,  and  expanding 
access  to  affordable  higher  education  is  necessary  for  bringing  us  closer 
to  fulfilling  this  ideal.  Over  the  past  several  generations,  our  country  built 
a  strong  middle  class  through  a  commitment  to  keeping  a  high-quality  edu-
cation  within  reach  for  all  those  willing  to  work  for  it,  and  now  more 
than  ever,  a  college  degree  is  the  surest  path  to  the  middle  class.  During 
National  College  Application  Month,  we  encourage  Americans  to  apply  for 
a  higher  education,  and  we  strive  to  ensure  every  student—no  matter  who 
they  are  or  where  they  come  from—has  a  chance  at  the  opportunities  they 
need to thrive. 
My Administration is committed to giving students and their families impor-
tant  information  on  college  admissions,  value,  and  costs  so  they  can  make 
decisions  that  are  right  for  them.  Last  year,  we  redesigned  a  new  College 
Scorecard with direct input from students, families, and advisers to provide 
clear  and  accessible  national  data  on  college  cost,  graduation  rates,  debt, 
and  post-college  earnings.  By  visiting  CollegeScorecard.Ed.gov,  more  Ameri-
cans  can  evaluate  college  choices  based  on  the  factors  that  matter  most 
to  them.  Through  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama’s  Reach  Higher  initiative, 
we  are  inspiring  more  students  to  pursue  a  higher  education,  ensuring 
they  have  what  they  need  to  complete  their  college  education,  and  helping 
them understand their financial aid eligibility. And we are working to reduce 
barriers to educational opportunity through the Fair Chance Higher Education 
Pledge—an  effort  in  which  public  and  private  colleges  and  universities 
are  helping  provide  individuals  with  criminal  records  who  have  already 
paid  their  debt  to  society  a  fair  chance  to  seek  a  higher  education.  To 
learn  more  about  ways  we  are  helping  more  Americans  pursue  a  higher 
education, visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/ReachHigher. 
Although  earning  a  college  degree  is  one  of  the  most  important  investments 
individuals  can  make  for  themselves  and  for  our  country,  it  still  feels  out 
of  reach  for  too  many  American  families.  That  is  why  we  have  taken  many 
steps  to  make  college  more  affordable,  including  doubling  investments  in 
grant and scholarship aid through Pell Grants and tax credits, keeping interest 
rates  low  on  Federal  student  loans,  and  helping  borrowers  manage  debt 
after  college  through  programs  like  the  Pay  as  You  Earn  plan.  This  year, 
we  launched  the  Free  Application  for  Federal  Student  Aid—which  is  avail-
able  at  www.FAFSA.gov—3  months  earlier  than  usual  so  that  students  can 
access  financial  aid  sooner  and  receive  better  information  as  they  search 
for  and  apply  to  colleges.  And  because  every  American  at  any  age  and 
from any walk of life should be able to earn the skills necessary to compete 
in  the  21st-century  economy,  I  have  proposed  making  community  college 
free for students with the drive and discipline to work for it. 
This month, we recognize the limitless potential in every student and reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  offering  them  the  resources  they  need  to  succeed.  We 
thank  not  only  the  teachers,  counselors,  and  parents  who  support  students 
throughout  the  college  application  process,  but  also  the  organizations  and 
institutions  partnering  with  us  to  eliminate  unnecessary  barriers  to  higher

education.  Let  us  celebrate  the  progress  we  have  made  as  more  historically 
underserved students are enrolling in college for the first time, more students 
are  graduating  from  college  than  ever  before,  and  new  student  loan  defaults 
are  on  the  decline.  And  together,  let  us  forge  a  future  where  every  student 
has  the  opportunity  to  go  as  far  as  their  dreams  and  hard  work  will  take 
them. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as National College Application Month. I call upon public officials, educators, 
parents, students, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate 
ceremonies, activities, and programs designed to encourage students to make 
plans for and apply to college. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-eighth 
day  of  October,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and 
forty-first.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

87391 

Executive  Order  13749  of  November  29,  2016 

Providing  for  the  Appointment  in  the  Competitive  Service  of 
Certain  Employees  of  the  Foreign  Service 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  sections  3301  and  3302 
of  title  5,  United  States  Code,  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States 
Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  Federal  Government  benefits  from  a  workforce  that 
can be recruited from the broadest and deepest pools of qualified candidates 
for our highly competitive, merit-based positions. The recruitment and reten-
tion  of  workforce  participants  who  serve  in  the  Foreign  Service  of  the 
Department of State under a Limited Non-Career Appointment under section 
309  of  the  Foreign  Service  Act  of  1980,  Public  Law  96–465  (22  U.S.C. 
3949), as amended, are critical to our ability to meet consular staffing levels 
(now  in  substantial  deficit)  and  thereby  enhance  our  capacity  to  meet  high 
national  security  standards  and  efficiently  process  visas  in  accordance  with 
our  policy  of  ‘‘open  doors,  safe  borders.’’  Program  participants  undergo 
a  rigorous  merit-based  evaluation  process,  which  includes  a  written  test 
and  an  oral  assessment  and  to  which  a  veteran  preference  applies,  and 
develop advanced- to superior-level skills in languages and in cultural com-
petence  in  particular  regions,  skills  that  are  essential  for  mission-critical 
positions throughout the entire Federal workforce. 
Executive Order 13597 of January 19, 2012, sought to ensure that 80 percent 
of nonimmigrant visa applicants be interviewed within three weeks of receiv-
ing  an  application.  The  Department  of  State’s  ability  to  maintain  this  80 
percent  benchmark  will  come  under  increasing  pressure  in  the  future  given 
current  and  projected  staffing  shortfalls  through  2023.  These  staffing  gaps 
could  adversely  affect  the  Department  of  State’s  ability  to  sustain  border 
security and immigration control at peak efficiency and effectiveness, which 
will  have  effects  on  tourism,  job  creation,  and  U.S.  economic  growth.  Use 
of  the  Limited  Non-Career  Appointment  hiring  authority  will  provide  flexi-
bility  to  address,  for  the  foreseeable  future,  both  this  increased  demand 
and recurring institutional and national needs across the Federal Government. 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  my  authority  under  5  U.S.C.  3302(1),  and  in  order 
to  achieve  a  workforce  that  represents  all  segments  of  society  as  provided 
in  5  U.S.C.  2301(b)(1),  I  find  that  conditions  of  good  administration  make 
necessary  an  exception  to  the  competitive  hiring  rules  for  certain  positions 
in the Federal civil service. 
Sec.  2.  The  head  of  any  agency  in  the  executive  branch  may  appoint  in 
the  competitive  service  an  individual  who  served  for  at  least  48  months 
of  continuous  service  in  the  Foreign  Service  of  the  Department  of  State 
under  a  Limited  Non-Career  Appointment  under  section  309  of  the  Foreign 
Service  Act  of  1980,  and  who  passes  such  examination  as  the  Office  of 
Personnel Management (OPM) may prescribe. 
Sec.  3.  In  order  to  be  eligible  for  noncompetitive  appointment  to  positions 
under section 2 of this order, such an individual must: 

(a) have received a satisfactory or better performance rating (or equivalent) 

for service under the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment; and 

(b) exercise the eligibility for noncompetitive appointment within a period 
of 1 year after completion of the qualifying Limited Non-Career Appointment.

Such  period  may  be  extended  to  not  more  than  3  years  in  the  case  of 
persons  who,  following  such  service,  are  engaged  in  military  service,  in 
the pursuit of studies at an institution of higher learning, or in other activities 
that,  in  the  view  of  the  appointing  authority,  warrant  an  extension  of  such 
period.  Such  period  may  also  be  extended  to  permit  the  adjudication  of 
a background investigation. 
Sec.  4.  A  person  appointed  under  section  2  of  this  order  shall  become 
a career conditional employee. 
Sec.  5.  Any  law,  Executive  Order,  or  regulation  that  would  disqualify  an 
applicant  for  appointment  in  the  competitive  service  shall  also  disqualify 
a person for appointment under section 2 of this order. Examples of disquali-
fying  criteria  include  restrictions  on  employing  persons  who  are  not  U.S. 
citizens  or  nationals,  who  have  violated  the  anti-nepotism  provisions  of 
the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(7), 3110, who have knowingly 
and  willfully  failed  to  register  for  Selective  Service  when  required  to  do 
so,  5  U.S.C.  3328(a)(2),  who  do  not  meet  occupational  qualifying  standards 
prescribed  by  OPM,  or  who  do  not  meet  suitability  factors  prescribed  by 
OPM. 
Sec.  6.  The  Office  of  Personnel  Management  is  authorized  to  issue  such 
additional  regulations  as  may  be  necessary  to  implement  this  order.  Any 
individual  who  meets  the  terms  of  this  order,  however,  is  eligible  for  non-
competitive eligibility with or without additional regulations. 
Sec.  7.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department,  agency,  or 
the  head  thereof,  or  the  status  of  that  department  or  agency  within  the 
Federal Government; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any  party 
against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,  its  officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.

Shelf  Lands  Act,  43  U.S.C.  1331  et  seq.,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  As  recognized  in  Executive  Order  13689  of  January 
21,  2015,  (Enhancing  Coordination  of  National  Efforts  in  the  Arctic),  Arctic 
environmental  stewardship  is  in  the  national  interest.  In  furtherance  of 
this  principle,  and  as  articulated  in  the  March  10,  2016,  U.S.-Canada  Joint 
Statement  on  Climate,  Energy,  and  Arctic  Leadership,  the  United  States 
has  resolved  to  confront  the  challenges  of  a  changing  Arctic  by  working 
to  conserve  Arctic  biodiversity;  support  and  engage  Alaska  Native  tribes; 
incorporate  traditional  knowledge  into  decisionmaking;  and  build  a  sustain-
able  Arctic  economy  that  relies  on  the  highest  safety  and  environmental 
standards,  including  adherence  to  national  climate  goals.  The  United  States 
is committed to achieving these goals in partnership with indigenous commu-
nities  and  through  science-based  decisionmaking.  This  order  carries  forth 
that vision in the northern Bering Sea region. 
The Bering Sea and Bering Strait are home to numerous subsistence commu-
nities,  rich  indigenous  cultures,  and  unique  marine  ecosystems,  each  of 
which plays an important role in maintaining regional resilience. The chang-
ing  climate  and  rising  average  temperatures  are  reducing  the  occurrence 
of  sea  ice;  changing  the  conditions  for  fishing,  hunting,  and  subsistence 
whaling;  and  opening  new  navigable  routes  to  increased  ship  traffic.  The 
preservation of a healthy and resilient Bering ecosystem, including its migra-
tory  pathways,  habitat,  and  breeding  grounds,  is  essential  for  the  survival 
of  marine  mammals,  fish,  seabirds,  other  wildlife,  and  the  subsistence  com-
munities  that  depend  on  them.  These  communities  possess  a  unique  under-
standing  of  the  Arctic  ecosystem,  and  their  traditional  knowledge  should 
serve as an important resource to inform Federal decisionmaking. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  It  shall  be  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  enhance  the 
resilience  of  the  northern  Bering  Sea  region  by  conserving  the  region’s 
ecosystem, including those natural resources that provide important cultural 
and  subsistence  value  and  services  to  the  people  of  the  region.  For  the 
purpose  of  carrying  out  the  specific  directives  provided  herein,  this  order 
delineates  an  area  hereafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘‘Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate 
Resilience  Area,’’  in  which  the  exercise  of  relevant  authorities  shall  be 
coordinated  among  all  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies).  All 
agencies  charged  with  regulating,  overseeing,  or  conducting  activities  in 
the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area  shall  do  so  with  attention 
to  the  rights,  needs,  and  knowledge  of  Alaska  Native  tribes;  the  delicate 
and  unique  ecosystem;  the  protection  of  marine  mammals,  fish,  seabirds, 
and  other  wildlife;  and  with  appropriate  coordination  with  the  State  of 
Alaska. 
The  boundary  of  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area  includes 
waters  within  the  U.S.  Exclusive  Economic  Zone  bounded  to  the  north 
by the seaward boundary of the Bering Straits Native Corporation established 
pursuant  to  the  Alaska  Native  Claims  Settlement  Act;  to  the  south  by  the 
southern  boundaries  of  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Research  Area,  the  St. 
Matthew  Habitat  Conservation  Area,  and  the  Nunivak-Kuskokwim  Habitat 
Conservation  Area;  and  to  the  west  by  the  maritime  boundary  delimited

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  240 / Wednesday,  December  14,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

by  the  Agreement  Between  the  United  States  of  America  and  the  Union 
of  Soviet  Socialist  Republics  on  the  Maritime  Boundary,  signed  at  Wash-
ington, June 1, 1990. 
Sec.  3.  Withdrawal.  Under  the  authority  granted  to  me  in  section  12(a) 
of  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  Lands  Act,  43  U.S.C.  1341(a),  I  hereby  with-
draw from disposition by leasing for a time period without specific expiration 
the  following  areas  of  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf:  (1)  the  area  currently 
designated by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management as the Norton Basin 
Planning  Area;  and  (2)  the  Outer  Continental  Shelf  lease  blocks  within 
the  Bureau  of  Ocean  Energy  Management’s  St.  Matthew-Hall  Planning  Area 
lying  within  25  nautical  miles  of  St.  Lawrence  Island.  The  boundaries  of 
the  withdrawn  areas  are  more  specifically  delineated  in  the  attached  map 
and,  with  respect  to  the  St.  Matthew-Hall  Planning  Area,  the  accompanying 
table  of  withdrawn  Outer  Continental  Shelf  lease  blocks.  Both  the  map 
and  table  form  a  part  of  this  order,  with  the  table  governing  the  withdrawal 
and withdrawal boundaries within the St. Matthew-Hall Planning Area. This 
withdrawal prevents consideration of these areas for future oil or gas leasing 
for  purposes  of  exploration,  development,  or  production.  This  withdrawal 
furthers  the  principles  of  responsible  public  stewardship  entrusted  to  this 
office  and  takes  due  consideration  of  the  importance  of  the  withdrawn 
area  to  Alaska  Native  tribes,  wildlife,  and  wildlife  habitat,  and  the  need 
for  regional  resiliency  in  the  face  of  climate  change.  Nothing  in  this  with-
drawal affects rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas. 
Sec.  4.  Task  Force  on  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area. 
(a)  There  is  established  a  Task  Force  on  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate 
Resilience  Area  (Bering  Task  Force),  under  the  Arctic  Executive  Steering 
Committee  (AESC)  established  in  Executive  Order  13689,  to  be  co-chaired 
by  an  office  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  the  National  Oceanic  and 
Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard. 

(b)  The  membership  of  the  Bering  Task  Force  (member  agencies)  shall 
include, in addition to the Co-Chairs, designated senior-level representatives 
from: 

(i) the Department of State; 
(ii) the Department of Defense; 
(iii) the Department of Transportation; 
(iv) the Environmental Protection Agency; 
(v) the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; 
(vi) the U.S. Arctic Research Commission; 
(vii) the National Science Foundation; and 
(viii) such agencies and offices as the Co-Chairs may designate. 
(c) Consistent with the authorities and responsibilities of its member agen-
cies,  the  Bering  Task  Force,  with  the  purpose  of  advancing  the  United 
States  policy  in  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area  as  set 
forth in section 2 of this order, shall: 

(i)  Establish  and  provide  regular  opportunities  to  consult  with  the  Bering 
Intergovernmental  Tribal  Advisory  Council  as  described  in  section  5  of 
this order; 
(ii) Coordinate activities of member agencies, including regulatory, policy, 
and research activities, affecting the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience 
Area and its value for subsistence and cultural purposes; 
(iii)  Consider  the  need  for  additional  actions  or  strategies  to  advance 
the policies established in section 2 of this order and provide recommenda-
tions as appropriate to the President through the AESC; 
(iv)  Consider  and  make  recommendations  with  respect  to  the  impacts 
of shipping on the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area including 
those described in sections 7 and 8 of this order; and

(v)  In  developing  and  implementing  recommendations,  coordinate  or  con-
sult as appropriate with existing AESC working groups, the State of Alaska, 
regional  and  local  governments,  Alaska  Native  tribal  governments,  Alaska 
Native  corporations  and  organizations,  the  private  sector,  other  relevant 
organizations, and academia. 

Sec. 5. The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council. (a) The Bering 
Task  Force,  within  6  months  of  the  date  of  this  order,  and  after  considering 
recommendations from Alaska Native tribal governments, shall, in accordance 
with existing law, establish a Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Coun-
cil,  for  the  purpose  of  providing  input  to  the  Bering  Task  Force  and  facili-
tating effective consultation with Alaska Native tribal governments. 

(b) The Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council shall be charged 
with  providing  input  and  recommendations  on  activities,  regulations,  guid-
ance,  or  policy  that  may  affect  actions  or  conditions  in  the  Northern  Bering 
Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area,  with  attention  given  to  climate  resilience;  the 
rights, needs, and knowledge of Alaska Native tribes; the delicate and unique 
ecosystem; and the protection of marine mammals and other wildlife. 

(c)  The  Bering  Intergovernmental  Tribal  Advisory  Council  should  include 
between  9  and  11  elected  officials  or  their  designees  representing  Alaska 
Native tribal governments with a breadth of interests in the Northern Bering 
Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area,  and  may  include  such  additional  Federal  offi-
cials  and  State  and  local  government  elected  officials  as  the  Bering  Task 
Force  deems  appropriate.  The  Bering  Intergovernmental  Tribal  Advisory 
Council  will  adopt  such  procedures  as  it  deems  necessary  to  govern  its 
activities. 
Sec.  6.  Traditional  Knowledge  in  Decisionmaking.  It  shall  be  the  policy 
of  the  United  States  to  recognize  and  value  the  participation  of  Alaska 
Native  tribal  governments  in  decisions  affecting  the  Northern  Bering  Sea 
Climate Resilience Area and for all agencies to consider traditional knowledge 
in  decisions  affecting  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area. 
Specifically,  all  agencies  shall  consider  applicable  information  from  the 
Bering Intergovernmental Tribal Advisory Council in the exercise of existing 
agency  authorities.  Such  input  may  be  received  through  existing  agency 
procedures and consultation processes. 
Sec.  7.  Pollution  from  Vessels.  The  Bering  Task  Force,  within  9  months 
of  the  date  of  this  order  and  after  coordination  as  needed  with  existing 
working groups within the AESC, shall provide the AESC with recommenda-
tions on: 

(a) Actions to ensure or support implementation of the International Code 
for Ships Operating in Polar Waters, as adopted by the International Maritime 
Organization, especially with respect to limitations on discharges from vessels 
in the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area; and 

(b)  Any  additional  measures  necessary  to  achieve  the  policies  established 
in  section  2  of  this  order,  such  as  the  potential  identification  of  zero- 
discharge zones, assessments of the pollution risks posed by increased vessel 
traffic,  or  noise  reduction  measures  associated  with  sensitive  ecological  and 
cultural areas within the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. 
Sec.  8.  Shipping  Routing  Measures.  (a)  In  recognition  of  the  United  States 
commitment  to  reduce  the  impact  of  shipping  within  the  Bering  Sea  and 
the Bering Strait and the many environmental factors in the Northern Bering 
Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area  that  inform  the  best  routes  for  navigation, 
safety,  and  the  marine  environment,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  should  conclude 
its  ongoing  port  access  route  study  for  the  Chukchi  Sea,  Bering  Strait, 
and  Bering  Sea  (Bering  Sea  PARS)  pursuant  to  the  Ports  and  Waterways 
Safety Act, 33 U.S.C. 1221 et seq. 

(b)  In  designation  of  routes  and  any  areas  to  be  avoided,  and  consistent 
with  existing  authorities,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  Northern 
Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area,  including  the  effects  of  shipping  and 
vessel  pollution  on  the  marine  environment,  fishery  resources,  the  seabed

ways and other biologically important areas, and subsistence whaling, hunt-
ing, and fishing. 

(c)  In  recognition  of  the  value  of  participation  of  Alaska  Native  tribal 
governments  in  decisions  affecting  the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resil-
ience  Area,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  should  consider  traditional  knowledge, 
including with respect to marine mammal, waterfowl, and seabird migratory 
pathways  and  feeding  and  breeding  grounds,  in  the  development  of  the 
Bering  Sea  PARS,  establishment  of  routing  measures  and  any  areas  to  be 
avoided, and subsequent rulemaking and management decisions. 

(d)  No  later  than  December  30,  2016,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  shall  publish 
preliminary findings for the Bering Sea PARS in the Federal Register, includ-
ing  information  related  to  its  status,  potential  routing  measures,  and  its 
projected  schedule.  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  should  also  consider  using  this 
opportunity to provide notice of any new information or proposed measures 
resulting from its ongoing consultation process. 

(e)  Upon  completion  of  the  Bering  Sea  PARS,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  shall 
promptly  issue  a  notice  of  proposed  rulemaking  for  any  designation  con-
templated  on  the  basis  of  the  study.  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard  shall  coordinate 
as  appropriate  with  the  Department  of  State  and  other  coastal  nations  and 
submit any proposed routing measures to the International Maritime Organi-
zation by 2018 for the purpose of their adoption and implementation. 
Sec.  9.  Oil  Spill  Preparedness.  The  U.S.  Coast  Guard,  in  coordination  with 
all  relevant  agencies  and  the  State  of  Alaska,  shall  update  the  Area  Contin-
gency  plans,  the  Subarea  Response  Plans,  and  the  Geographic  Response 
Strategies relevant to the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area. These 
plans and strategies shall be consistent with the National Contingency Plan, 
and  shall  include  appropriate  measures  to  improve  local  response  capacity 
and  preparedness  such  as  spill  response  training  opportunities  for  local 
communities,  including  Hazardous  Waste  Operations  and  Emergency  Re-
sponse  training  for  Village  Public  Safety  Officers  and  other  first  responders. 
Sec.  10.  Continuity  of  Existing  Habitat  Protection.  The  area  included  in 
the  Northern  Bering  Sea  Climate  Resilience  Area  is  currently  closed  to 
commercial  non-pelagic  trawl  gear  under  rules  implementing  the  Fishery 
Management  Plans  of  the  Bering  Sea  and  Aleutian  Islands  Management 
Area  and  the  Arctic  Management  Area.  Consistent  with  existing  law,  the 
National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration,  in  coordination  with 
the  North  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council,  shall  take  such  actions  as 
are  necessary  to  support  the  policy  set  forth  in  section  2  of  this  order, 
including actions to maintain the existing prohibitions on the use of commer-
cial non-pelagic trawl gear. 
Sec.  11.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect: 

(1)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  a  department,  agency,  or  the  head 

thereof; or 

(2) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget 

relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistently  with  applicable  law 

and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, 
substantive  or  procedural,  enforceable  at  law  or  in  equity  by  any  party 
against  the  United  States,  its  departments,  agencies,  or  entities,  its  officers, 
employees, or agents, or any other person.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

69991 

Proclamation  9514  of  October  3,  2016 

National  Youth  Substance  Use  and  Substance  Use  Disorder 
Prevention  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Far  too  many  young  people  are  unable  to  grow  and  thrive  because  of  sub-
stance  use.  And  far  too  many  precious  lives  are  being  taken  from  us  as 
a  result  of  drug  overdoses,  leaving  families  devastated  and  heartbroken. 
Substance  use  can  also  lead  to  lower  academic  achievement  and  a  variety 
of  physical  and  emotional  consequences,  and  it  is  crucial  that  America’s 
youth  learn  and  understand  the  risks  connected  with  it.  Youth  substance 
use  can  be  prevented—and  with  dedicated,  collective  effort  across  our  com-
munities, we can ensure more Americans live long, productive lives. During 
National  Youth  Substance  Use  and  Substance  Use  Disorder  Prevention 
Month, we come together in common purpose to unite behind this important 
mission. 
My  Administration’s  National  Drug  Control  Strategy  has  enabled  us  to  am-
plify  prevention  efforts  by  working  with  States  to  implement  evidence- 
based strategies that support communities and strengthen drug-free programs. 
Every  dollar  invested  in  school-based  substance  use  prevention  programs 
can save nearly $18 in costs related to the disease of substance use disorder 
later  on.  We  must  facilitate  open  discussions  with  families  and  children— 
as  well  as  health  care  providers—about  the  dangers  posed  by  the  misuse 
of prescription drugs, because for many individuals, their opioid use disorder 
starts  by  misusing  prescription  medications  found  in  their  home  medicine 
cabinet.  This  is  especially  important  because  our  Nation  is  currently  facing 
an opioid epidemic, including a near quadrupling of opioid overdose deaths 
since  1999.  That  is  why  I  continue  to  call  on  the  Congress  to  provide 
$1.1  billion  to  expand  access  to  treatment  services  for  prescription  opioid 
misuse and heroin use. 
With  evidence-based  approaches  and  community-led  prevention  activities, 
we  can  improve  health  and  safety  and  give  our  young  people  the  tools 
they  need  to  make  smart  decisions.  Parents,  guardians,  teachers,  coaches, 
community  members,  and  the  health  care  community  can  all  play  a  part 
in  promoting  substance  use  prevention  efforts.  This  month,  let  us  continue 
taking  every  step  possible  to  increase  these  efforts  for  our  young  people— 
and  for  all  Americans—so  that  they  may  pursue  a  bright  future  filled  with 
possibility and opportunity. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Youth  Substance  Use  and  Substance  Use  Disorder  Prevention 
Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  engage  in  appropriate  programs  and 
activities  to  promote  comprehensive  prevention  efforts  to  reduce  youth  sub-
stance use and substance use disorders within their communities.

Proclamation  9533  of  October  31,  2016 

Critical  Infrastructure  Security  and  Resilience  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
From  the  energy  that  powers  our  homes  to  the  systems  that  allow  us  to 
communicate  with  one  another,  our  critical  infrastructure  is  essential  to 
the  stability  and  strength  of  our  national  security,  economy,  and  public 
health.  The  assets,  networks,  and  systems  that  enable  us  to  innovate  and 
prosper  are  necessary  for  sustaining  and  supporting  the  well-being  of  our 
Nation,  and  our  increasing  dependence  on  them  makes  securing  and  pro-
tecting  them  a  top  priority.  This  month,  we  recognize  the  importance  of 
our  critical  infrastructure  and  resolve  to  safeguard  these  vital  systems  so 
they remain strong and resilient. 
Our  critical  infrastructure  spans  a  wide  array  of  structures  and  systems 
we  rely  on  to  meet  our  day-to-day  needs.  It  includes  government  facilities, 
the  electric  grid,  transportation  and  water  systems,  information  technology, 
and financial systems—all which play an equally important role in maintain-
ing  our  way  of  life.  These  complex  systems  work  together  to  keep  us  safe 
and  healthy,  and  although  they  are  among  the  most  advanced  and  secure 
in  the  world,  we  must  remain  vigilant  and  ensure  their  resilience  by  miti-
gating the threats and stresses that can weaken them. 
Securing  our  complex  critical  infrastructure  systems  requires  cooperation 
and sustained commitment from everyone, which is why my Administration 
is  working  with  businesses,  infrastructure  owners,  and  officials  at  all  levels 
of  government  to  protect  them.  We  must  take  necessary  steps  to  modernize 
our  roads,  bridges,  pipes,  and  ports  to  ensure  they  remain  resilient  and 
strong—especially  as  climate  change  becomes  an  increasing  risk,  causing 
more  extreme  weather  events  that  threaten  our  infrastructure.  In  addition 
to  physical  threats  and  hazards,  cybersecurity  risks  pose  another  significant 
challenge  to  our  Nation.  We  must  ensure  that  addressing  threats  to  the 
security of our data and our digital networks remains a priority. By partnering 
with  the  private  sector,  and  with  the  help  of  the  American  people,  we 
can  prepare  our  critical  infrastructure  to  withstand  and  respond  to  cyber 
threats,  terrorist  attacks,  acts  of  nature  including  space  weather  events,  and 
other threats and hazards. 
Three  years  ago,  I  issued  a  Presidential  Policy  Directive  to  strengthen  and 
maintain secure and resilient critical infrastructure. Today, we are continuing 
to  carry  out  this  vision  for  how  Government  and  the  private  sector  can 
work  together  to  reduce  risks  and  increase  the  stability  and  security  of 
our  infrastructure.  And  because  our  world  has  never  been  more  inter-
connected, we know that keeping our critical infrastructure functioning will 
require collaboration with international partners. That is why we are working 
to promote global critical infrastructure security and resilience through infor-
mation sharing with partners around the world. 
As  our  population  grows  and  our  technology  advances,  the  demands  of 
our  critical  infrastructure  become  increasingly  significant.  During  Critical 
Infrastructure Security and Resilience Month, we recommit to reducing risks 
to  these  important  systems  and  preparing  to  adapt  and  respond  to  any 
incident  that  may  occur.  To  ensure  more  Americans  can  thrive  in  a  future 
of  greater  safety,  stability,  and  prosperity,  we  must  protect  and  enhance

88605 

Proclamation  9550  of  December  2,  2016 

International  Day  of  Persons  With  Disabilities,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Over  a  quarter-century  ago,  the  United  States  enshrined  into  law  the  prin-
ciples  of  equal  access  and  equal  opportunity  for  people  with  disabilities 
through  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  which  upholds  the 
principle  that  each  of  us  is  entitled  to  a  set  of  fundamental  freedoms  and 
protections.  This  progress  has  made  America  a  leader  in  advancing  the 
rights  of  people  with  disabilities  around  the  globe.  On  International  Day 
of Persons with Disabilities, we celebrate how far we have come in protecting 
the  rights  of  those  who  live  with  disabilities  and  recommit  to  shaping 
a  future  in  which  all  members  of  this  community  can  enjoy  their  full 
rights and freedoms. 
Building on the progress of the ADA, my Administration has taken important 
steps  to  remove  barriers  and  eliminate  discrimination  based  on  disability. 
Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  individuals  can  no  longer  be  denied 
coverage because of a pre-existing condition or disability. We have supported 
increasing funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, reau-
thorized  the  Children’s  Health  Insurance  Program,  and  strengthened  anti- 
discrimination and Olmstead enforcement at the Department of Justice. Addi-
tionally, we created the first-ever Special Advisor for International Disability 
Rights, and we established the United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond 
to  Gender-Based  Violence  Globally  in  order  to  address  violence  against 
women  and  girls  around  the  world—because  women  with  a  disability  are 
more  likely  to  experience  physical  and  sexual  abuse  than  women  without 
one. And last year, we committed to achieving the Sustainable Development 
Goals,  which  recognize  inclusive  education,  disability  employment,  and  so-
cial  acceptance  of  the  disability  community  as  important  steps  to  ending 
world poverty. 
Our  progress  at  home  reflects  our  full  commitment  to  the  rights  of  people 
with  disabilities  around  the  world.  America  was  the  first  country  to  com-
prehensively address non-discrimination on the basis of disability in national 
legislation  and  declare  that  disability  rights  are  human  rights  which  must 
be  recognized  and  promoted  everywhere.  In  my  first  year  in  office,  the 
United States joined 140 other nations in signing the United Nations Conven-
tion on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities—the first international human 
rights  convention  to  fully  address  human  rights  in  the  context  of  disability. 
Now  joined  by  over  160  States  Parties,  this  Convention  serves  as  a  beacon 
of  hope  to  the  more  than  1  billion  people  worldwide  who  live  with  a 
disability—a  reminder  that  the  need  to  protect  disability  rights  does  not 
end  at  our  borders.  Regrettably,  the  Senate  has  still  not  provided  its  advice 
and  consent  for  ratification  of  this  Convention,  and  I  urge  them  to  do 
so  and  to  uphold  our  global  commitment  to  the  international  disability 
community. 
We  have  taken  important  steps  forward  to  advance  the  rights  of  persons 
with  disabilities,  but  the  fight  is  not  over.  As  long  as  anyone  succumbs 
to  casual  discrimination  or  fear  of  the  unfamiliar,  we  have  more  work 
to  do  to  honor  the  many  people  with  disabilities  who  have  shared  their 
stories  of  exclusion  and  injustice—and  the  millions  more  they  spoke  up

for.  Because  of  the  advocates  who  have  led  the  way,  more  individuals 
with  disabilities  can  pursue  their  full  measure  of  happiness.  They  have 
taught  us  that  our  world  is  far  better  off  when  all  people  can  live  up 
to  their  full  potential—it  makes  all  of  us  more  whole,  and  it  makes  our 
world a better place. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  December  3,  2016, 
as  International  Day  of  Persons  with  Disabilities.  I  call  on  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies,  activities,  and  programs. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  second  day 
of  December,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Proclamation  9390  of  January  15,  2016 

Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  Federal  Holiday,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
With profound faith in our Nation’s promise, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther 
King,  Jr.,  led  a  non-violent  movement  that  urged  our  country’s  leaders  to 
expand  the  reach  of  freedom  and  provide  equal  opportunity  for  all.  Dr. 
King  joined  a  long  line  of  heroes  and  vindicated  the  belief  at  the  heart 
of  our  founding:  that  humble  citizens,  armed  with  little  but  faith,  can  come 
together  to  change  the  world  and  remake  an  America  that  more  closely 
aligns with our highest ideals. 
Dr.  King  recognized  that,  as  a  country  built  on  the  foundation  of  self- 
governance,  our  success  rested  on  engaging  ordinary  citizens  in  the  work 
of  securing  our  birthright  liberties.  Together,  with  countless  unsung  heroes 
equally  committed  to  the  idea  that  America  is  a  constant  work  in  progress, 
he heeded the call etched into our founding documents nearly two centuries 
before  his  time,  marching  and  sacrificing  for  the  idea  of  a  fair,  just,  and 
inclusive society. By preaching his dream of a day when his children would 
be  judged  by  the  content  of  their  character—rather  than  by  the  color  of 
their skin—he helped awaken our Nation to the bitter truth that basic justice 
for  all  had  not  yet  been  realized.  And  in  his  efforts,  he  peaceably  yet 
forcefully  demonstrated  that  it  is  not  enough  to  only  have  equal  protection 
under the law, but also that equal opportunity for all of our Nation’s children 
is necessary so that they can shape their own destinies. 
Today,  we  celebrate  the  long  arc  of  progress  for  which  Dr.  King  and  so 
many  other  leaders  fought  to  bend  toward  a  brighter  day.  It  is  our  mission 
to  fulfill  his  vision  of  a  Nation  devoted  to  rejecting  bigotry  in  all  its  forms; 
to  rising  above  cynicism  and  the  belief  that  we  cannot  change;  and  to 
cherishing  dignity  and  opportunity  not  only  for  our  own  daughters  and 
sons, but also for our neighbors’ children. 
We  have  made  great  advances  since  Dr.  King’s  time,  yet  injustice  remains 
in  many  corners  of  our  country.  In  too  many  communities,  the  cycle  of 
poverty  persists  and  students  attend  schools  without  adequate  resources— 
some  that  serve  as  a  pipeline  to  prison  for  young  people  of  color.  Children 
still  go  to  bed  hungry,  and  the  sick  go  without  sufficient  treatment  in 
neighborhoods  across  America.  To  put  up  blinders  to  these  realities  or 
to  intimate  that  they  are  inherent  to  a  Nation  as  large  and  diverse  as 
ours  would  do  a  disservice  to  those  who  fought  so  hard  to  ensure  ours 
was  a  country  dedicated  to  the  proposition  that  all  people  are  created 
equal. 
‘‘We  may  have  all  come  on  different  ships,  but  we’re  in  the  same  boat 
now,’’  Dr.  King  once  said.  As  the  most  diverse  country  on  Earth,  ensuring 
this  creed  is  reflected  in  our  hearts,  minds,  and  policies  is  the  imperative 
of  our  citizenship.  As  Americans  of  all  races  and  beliefs  come  together 
on  this  day  of  service  to  honor  the  life  and  legacy  of  the  Reverend  Dr. 
Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  let  us  pledge  to  recognize  the  common  humanity 
of  all  people,  regardless  of  the  color  of  their  skin  or  the  station  into  which 
they were born. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

Executive  Order  13728  of  May  18,  2016 

Wildland-Urban  Interface  Federal  Risk  Mitigation 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, and to improve the Nation’s resilience 
to wildfire, I hereby direct the following: 
Section  1.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  strengthen  the 
security  and  resilience  of  the  Nation  against  the  impacts  of  wildfire.  The 
annual estimates on structure loss due to wildfire have increased dramatically 
over  the  past  six  decades  as  a  result  of  multi-year  drought  conditions  in 
combination  with  accumulated  fuel  loads,  growing  populations  residing  in 
the  wildland-urban  interface,  and  associated  increases  in  the  exposure  of 
built  environments.  As  such,  we  must  continue  to  ensure  our  Nation  is 
resilient  to  wildfire  in  order  to  promote  public  safety,  economic  strength, 
and national security. 
The  Federal  Government  must  continue  to  take  proactive  steps  to  enhance 
the  resilience  of  buildings  that  are  owned  by  the  Federal  Government  and 
are located on Federal land. Each executive department and agency (agency) 
responsible  for  implementing  this  order  shall  seek  to  enhance  the  resilience 
of  its  buildings  when  making  investment  decisions  to  ensure  continued 
performance  of  essential  functions  and  to  reduce  risks  to  its  buildings’ 
occupants in the event of a wildfire. 
Sec.  2.  Codes  and  Concurrent  Requirements.  (a)  Commencing  within  90 
days  of  the  completion  of  the  implementing  guidelines  as  described  in 
section 3(b)(i) of this order, each agency shall ensure that every new Federal 
building above 5,000 gross square feet on Federal land within the wildland- 
urban  interface  at  moderate  or  greater  wildfire  risk  for  which  the  agency 
has  not  completed  design  is  in  compliance  with  the  2015  edition  of  the 
International  Wildland-Urban  Interface  Code  (IWUIC)  promulgated  by  the 
International  Code  Council  (ICC),  or  an  equivalent  code,  consistent  with 
the  provisions  of  and  to  the  extent  required  by  40  U.S.C.  3312.  When 
the  ICC  releases  a  new  version  of  the  IWUIC,  a  determination  shall  be 
made  whether  the  new  version  is  a  nationally  recognized  code  for  the 
purposes  of  40  U.S.C.  3312(b),  as  expeditiously  as  practicable,  but  not  later 
than  2  years  after  the  release  of  the  new  version.  If  a  determination  is 
made  that  a  new  version  is  a  nationally  recognized  code,  agencies  shall 
ensure  that  any  Federal  building  covered  by  this  section  for  which  the 
agency  has  not  completed  design  is  in  compliance  with  that  new  version, 
or  an  equivalent  code,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  and  to  the  extent 
required by 40 U.S.C. 3312. 

(b)  Commencing  within  90  days  of  the  completion  of  the  implementing 
guidelines  as  described  in  section  3(b)(i)  of  this  order,  each  agency  respon-
sible  for  the  alteration  of  an  existing  Federal  building  above  5,000  gross 
square feet on Federal land within the wildland-urban interface at moderate 
or  greater  wildfire  risk  for  which  the  agency  has  not  completed  design 
shall ensure that the alteration is effectuated in compliance with the IWUIC, 
or  an  equivalent  code,  consistent  with  the  provisions  of  and  to  the  extent 
required  by  40  U.S.C.  3312.  When  the  ICC  releases  a  new  version  of  the 
IWUIC, a determination shall be made whether the new version is a nationally 
recognized  code  for  the  purposes  of  40  U.S.C.  3312(b),  as  expeditiously 
as practicable, but not later than 2 years after the release of the new version. 
If  a  determination  is  made  that  a  new  version  is  a  nationally  recognized 
code, agencies shall ensure that any Federal building covered by this section

Proclamation  9551  of  December  6,  2016 

National  Pearl  Harbor  Remembrance  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Seventy-five  years  ago,  Japanese  fighter  planes  attacked  the  United  States 
Naval Base at Pearl Harbor, destroying much of our Pacific Fleet and killing 
more  than  2,400  Americans.  The  following  day,  President  Franklin  D.  Roo-
sevelt  called  on  the  Congress  to  declare  war  and  ‘‘make  it  very  certain 
that  this  form  of  treachery  shall  never  again  endanger  us.’’  In  that  spirit, 
Americans came together to pay tribute to the victims, support the survivors, 
and  shed  the  comforts  of  civilian  life  to  serve  in  our  military  and  fight 
for  our  Union.  Each  year  on  National  Pearl  Harbor  Remembrance  Day,  we 
honor  those  whose  lives  were  forever  changed  that  December  morning  and 
resolve  to  uphold  the  legacy  of  all  who  stepped  forward  in  our  time  of 
need. 
From the docks of Pearl Harbor to the beaches of Normandy and far around 
the  world,  brave  patriots  served  their  country  and  defended  the  values 
that  have  sustained  our  Nation  since  its  founding.  They  went  to  war  for 
liberty  and  sacrificed  more  than  most  of  us  will  ever  know;  they  chased 
victory  and  defeated  fascism,  turning  adversaries  into  allies  and  writing 
a  new  chapter  in  our  history.  Through  their  service  and  unparalleled  devo-
tion,  they  inspired  a  generation  with  their  refusal  to  give  in  despite  over-
whelming  odds.  And  as  we  reflect  on  the  profound  debt  of  gratitude  we 
owe  them  for  the  freedoms  we  cherish,  we  are  reminded  of  the  everlasting 
responsibilities we have to one another and to our country. 
In  memory  of  all  who  lost  their  lives  on  December  7,  1941—and  those 
who  responded  by  leaving  their  homes  for  the  battlefields—we  must  ensure 
the  sacrifices  they  made  in  the  name  of  liberty  and  democracy  were  not 
made  in  vain.  On  this  solemn  anniversary,  there  can  be  no  higher  tribute 
to  these  American  patriots  than  forging  a  united  commitment  to  honor 
our  troops  and  veterans,  give  them  the  support  and  care  they  deserve, 
and carry on their work of keeping our country strong and free. 
The Congress, by Public Law 103–308, as amended, has designated December 
7 of each year as ‘‘National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 2016, as National Pearl Harbor 
Remembrance  Day.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  observe  this  solemn  day 
of remembrance and to honor our military, past and present, with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities. I urge all Federal agencies and interested organiza-
tions,  groups,  and  individuals  to  fly  the  flag  of  the  United  States  at  half- 
staff  this  December  7  in  honor  of  those  American  patriots  who  died  as 
a result of their service at Pearl Harbor.

Proclamation  9495  of  September  15,  2016 

The  President 

National  POW/MIA  Recognition  Day,  2016 

64757 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  centuries,  courageous  members  of  our  Armed  Forces  have  embodied 
the  best  of  America  with  devotion  and  patriotism.  On  National  POW/MIA 
Recognition  Day,  we  pause  to  remember  our  servicemen  and  women  who 
never  returned  home.  The  hardship  experienced  by  prisoners  of  war  and 
by the family members of those who have gone missing in action is unimagi-
nable  to  most  Americans;  it  is  our  country’s  solemn  obligation  to  bring 
these  heroes  back  to  the  land  they  served  to  defend,  and  to  support  the 
families who, each day, carry on without knowing the peace of being reunited 
with their loved ones. 
The  United  States  does  not  leave  anyone  behind,  and  we  do  not  forget 
those  who  remain  missing.  We  will  never  stop  working  to  bring  home 
those  who  gave  everything  for  their  country,  nor  cease  in  our  pursuit  of 
the  fullest  possible  accounting  for  all  who  are  missing.  We  are  working 
to  fulfill  this  promise  by  strengthening  communication  with  the  families 
of  those  service  members  missing  or  taken  prisoner.  And  as  Commander 
in Chief, I am committed to living up to this responsibility. 
The  men  and  women  of  our  Armed  Forces  face  unthinkable  conditions 
and  bear  the  painful  cost  of  war.  Theirs  is  a  debt  we  can  never  fully 
repay,  though  we  will  continue  striving  to  remain  worthy  of  their  sacrifice. 
In  honor  of  those  who  have  not  yet  come  home,  and  the  families  who 
struggle  with  the  fear  of  unknown  fate,  we  renew  our  fierce  commitment 
to  our  patriots  in  uniform  and  pledge  to  do  everything  we  can  to  bring 
those missing or held prisoner home. 
On September 16, 2016, the stark black and white banner symbolizing Amer-
ica’s  Missing  in  Action  and  Prisoners  of  War  will  be  flown  over  the  White 
House;  the  United  States  Capitol;  the  Departments  of  State,  Defense,  and 
Veterans  Affairs;  the  Selective  Service  System  Headquarters;  the  World  War 
II  Memorial;  the  Korean  War  Veterans  Memorial;  the  Vietnam  Veterans  Me-
morial;  United  States  post  offices;  national  cemeteries;  and  other  locations 
across our country. We raise this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation 
to always remember the sacrifices made to defend our Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  16,  2016, 
as  National  POW/MIA  Recognition  Day.  I  urge  all  Americans  to  observe 
this day of honor and remembrance with appropriate ceremonies and activi-
ties.

On  June  26,  2001,  by  Executive  Order  13219,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  Western  Balkans,  pursuant  to  the 
International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  to 
deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of persons 
engaged  in,  or  assisting,  sponsoring,  or  supporting  (i)  extremist  violence 
in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, 
or  (ii)  acts  obstructing  implementation  of  the  Dayton  Accords  in  Bosnia 
or  United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolution  1244  of  June  10,  1999,  in 
Kosovo.  The  President  subsequently  amended  that  order  in  Executive  Order 
13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to acts obstruct-
ing  implementation  of  the  Ohrid  Framework  Agreement  of  2001  relating 
to Macedonia. 

The  actions  of  persons  threatening  the  peace  and  international  stabilization 
efforts  in  the  Western  Balkans,  including  acts  of  extremist  violence  and 
obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  and  thereafter  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must 
continue  in  effect  beyond  June  26,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with 
section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am 
continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  Western 
Balkans declared in Executive Order 13219. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9464  of  June  17,  2016 

The  President 

Father’s  Day,  2016 

40473 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Blessed  with  the  extraordinary  privilege  and  remarkable  responsibility  of 
fatherhood,  dads  play  vital  roles  in  our  lives—inspiring  us  to  reach  for 
our  highest  potential,  lifting  us  up  when  we  need  it  most,  and  helping 
us  become  the  people  we  were  meant  to  be.  Doing  right  by  our  families 
is  the  most  important  job  any  of  us  will  ever  have.  On  Father’s  Day,  we 
thank the wonderful fathers—and stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers, 
and  mentors—in  our  lives,  and  we  recognize  the  sacrifices  they  make  to 
be there for us, through good times and bad. 
Fathers  provide  the  discipline,  guidance,  and  love  it  takes  to  flourish.  With 
persistence  and  patience,  generosity  and  integrity,  they  build  our  cores  and 
help  us  understand  right  from  wrong.  They  are  some  of  our  earliest  and 
strongest  sources  of  support  and  encouragement,  and  they  serve  as  role 
models  and  sounding  boards  in  our  youth  and  as  we  grow.  From  single 
fathers  who  struggle  to  make  ends  meet  to  surrogates  who  step  up  to  be 
there for America’s daughters and sons, these men help shoulder the greatest 
obligation  that  exists—raising  the  next  generation.  Regardless  of  sexual  ori-
entation,  gender  identity,  or  marital  status;  whether  biological,  foster,  or 
adoptive;  fathers  teach  their  children  the  values  that  matter  most  and  steer 
their moral compasses. 
My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  enacting  policies  that  make  it  easier 
for  working  fathers  to  support  their  families,  including  paid  family  leave. 
We  must  promote  responsible  fatherhood  by  lifting  up  the  fathers  who 
do  their  part  to  be  the  parents  and  providers  their  children  need  and  by 
rejecting any excuse for failing to meet this obligation. Too many Americans 
grow  up  without  a  father  figure  in  their  lives,  and  it  is  imperative  that 
America’s  responsible  men  step  up  to  be  mentors  for  our  young  people 
in  need  of  guidance.  To  learn  more,  visit  www.Fatherhood.gov  or 
www.Mentor.gov. 
Being a father is about more than just having children—it is about summoning 
the  courage  to  love  and  support  them  over  anything  else.  We  must  always 
strive  to  be  the  best  parents  and  role  models  we  can  be  and  commit  to 
being  present  in  the  lives  of  our  kids.  Nothing  is  more  precious  than  the 
moments  we  get  to  spend  with  our  families—in  conversations  at  the  dinner 
table,  coaching  tips  shouted  from  the  sidelines,  or  profound  experiences 
of  learning  and  growing  and  teaching.  Today,  let  us  express  our  gratitude 
for  the  men  who  have  enriched  our  lives  and  shaped  our  characters,  and 
let  us  never  stop  working  to  show  them  how  much  they  are  valued  and 
loved. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  in  accordance  with  a  joint  resolution  of  the  Congress  approved 
April  24,  1972,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  109),  do  hereby  proclaim  June  19, 
2016,  as  Father’s  Day.  I  direct  the  appropriate  officials  of  the  Government 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  on  all  Government  buildings  on 
this  day,  and  I  call  upon  all  citizens  to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation  9515  of  October  5,  2016 

German-American  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  centuries,  German  immigrants  have  ventured  to  American  shores  for 
the  same  reasons  as  so  many  others—to  pursue  new  lives  in  a  land  of 
opportunity  and  forge  brighter  futures  for  themselves  and  their  families. 
These  immigrants  and  their  descendants  have  changed  the  course  of  our 
history  and  paved  our  country’s  path  of  progress,  and  on  German-American 
Day,  we  recognize  their  role  in  building  a  stronger  and  more  prosperous 
Nation for all our people. 
From  those  who  were  among  our  earliest  settlers  and  farmers  to  today’s 
innovative  leaders  in  business  and  public  service,  German  Americans  have 
shaped  every  sector  of  our  society.  More  Americans  can  trace  their  roots 
to  Germany  than  to  any  other  nation,  and  elements  of  German  heritage 
are  embedded  deeply  in  our  country’s  character.  German  Americans  have, 
throughout  our  history,  proven  that  our  diversity  is  one  of  our  greatest 
strengths,  and  that  no  matter  where  we  come  from,  as  Americans  we  are 
united by the ideal that we are all created equal. 
Today,  the  alliance  between  the  United  States  and  Germany  is  one  of  the 
closest  the  world  has  ever  known.  Our  cooperation  in  striving  to  protect 
the  security  and  sustainability  of  our  planet  is  guided  by  the  enduring 
friendship  between  our  citizens  and  the  experiences  and  values  that  bind 
us  together.  On  this  occasion,  let  us  honor  the  achievements  of  German 
Americans by renewing our devotion to beliefs borne out of common experi-
ence—by  creating  opportunity  that  lifts  up  not  just  the  few  but  the  many, 
and  by  affirming  the  inherent  dignity  and  equality  of  every  human  being. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  6,  2016, 
as  German-American  Day.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  learn  more  about 
the  history  of  German  Americans  and  reflect  on  the  many  contributions 
they have made to our Nation.

Proclamation  9434  of  April  29,  2016 

Asian  American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) are the fastest growing racial 
group  in  our  country,  growing  over  4  times  as  rapidly  as  the  population 
of the United States. As one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse 
groups  in  America,  the  AAPI  community  reminds  us  that  though  we  all 
have  distinct  backgrounds  and  origins,  we  are  bound  in  common  purpose 
by our shared hopes and dreams for ourselves and our children. Our Nation’s 
story would be incomplete without the voices of countless Asian Americans, 
Native  Hawaiians,  and  Pacific  Islanders  who  have  called  the  land  we  all 
love  home.  This  month,  we  honor  the  irreplaceable  roles  they  have  played 
in our past, and we recommit to ensuring opportunities exist for generations 
of AAPIs to come. 
The  AAPI  community’s  long  and  deeply-rooted  legacy  in  the  United  States 
reminds  us  of  both  proud  and  painful  chapters  of  our  history.  Confronted 
with grueling and perilous working conditions, thousands of Chinese laborers 
on  the  transcontinental  railroad  pushed  the  wheels  of  progress  forward 
in  the  West.  Japanese  American  troops  fought  for  freedom  from  tyranny 
abroad  in  World  War  II  while  their  families  here  at  home  were  interned 
simply  on  the  basis  of  their  origin.  And  many  South  Asian  Americans 
in  particular  face  discrimination,  harassment,  and  senseless  violence  often 
in the communities in which they live and work. 
Today,  AAPIs  lend  their  rich  heritage  to  enhancing  our  communities  and 
our  culture.  As  artists  and  activists,  educators  and  elected  officials,  service 
men and women and business owners, AAPIs help drive our country forward. 
Yet  despite  hard-won  achievements,  AAPIs  continue  to  face  obstacles  to 
realizing  their  full  potential.  One  in  three  AAPIs  does  not  speak  English 
fluently,  and  certain  subgroups  experience  low  levels  of  educational  attain-
ment and high levels of unemployment. AAPIs also often experience height-
ened  health  risks,  and  millions  of  AAPI  men,  women,  and  children  in 
the United States live in poverty. 
My  Administration  is  committed  to  supporting  and  investing  in  AAPI  com-
munities.  Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  20  million  uninsured  adults 
have  gained  health  insurance  coverage,  including  2  million  AAPIs.  Among 
Asian  Americans  under  the  age  of  65,  the  uninsured  rate  has  declined 
by  55  percent  since  2013.  Last  year,  we  brought  together  thousands  of 
AAPI artists; advocates; and business, community, and Federal leaders from 
across  America  for  the  first-ever  White  House  Summit  on  AAPIs  to  discuss 
the  key  issues  facing  their  communities.  The  Summit  was  hosted  by  the 
White  House  Initiative  on  AAPIs,  which  I  reestablished  during  my  first 
year  in  office  and  is  housed  within  the  Department  of  Education.  We  are 
working  with  Federal  agencies  to  build  stronger  and  more  robust  regional 
networks  across  our  country  that  improve  access  to  Federal  resources  and 
expand  opportunities.  We  have  worked  to  protect  civil  rights,  foster  edu-
cational equity, and create economic opportunity across our country. Because 
a  lack  of  detailed  data  perpetuates  the  false  notion  of  AAPIs  as  a  model 
minority,  we  are  working  across  Government  to  improve  data  collection 
to  counter  existing  stereotypes  and  to  shed  light  on  the  realities  faced

and  resources  needed  by  the  AAPI  community.  Through  the  White  House 
Task  Force  on  New  Americans,  Federal  agencies  are  working  with  cities 
and  counties  around  America  to  build  welcoming  communities  that  allow 
immigrants  and  refugees  to  thrive.  And  we  will  continue  working  to  allow 
more  high-skilled  immigrants  to  stay  in  our  country—too  many  talented 
AAPIs  are  held  back  from  fully  realizing  our  country’s  promise,  and  too 
many  have  suffered  the  consequences  of  our  Nation’s  broken  immigration 
system. 
Peoples  of  diverse  backgrounds  and  circumstances  have  long  come  to  our 
country  with  the  faith  that  they  could  build  a  better  life  in  America,  and 
spanning  generations,  the  story  of  AAPIs  in  the  United  States  embodies 
this  promise.  During  Asian  American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage  Month, 
let  us  celebrate  the  many  contributions  our  AAPI  brothers  and  sisters  have 
made to the American mosaic, and let us renew our commitment to creating 
more  opportunities  for  AAPI  youth  as  they  grow  up  and  embrace  the  hard 
work  of  active  citizenship,  adding  their  unique  voices  and  experiences  to 
our Nation’s narrative. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  2016  as  Asian 
American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to visit www.WhiteHouse.gov/AAPI to learn more about our efforts on behalf 
of Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders, and to observe 
this month with appropriate programs and activities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  April,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Notice  of  March  3,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Venezuela 

On  March  8,  2015,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13692,  declaring  a  national 
emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela, including the Govern-
ment  of  Venezuela’s  erosion  of  human  rights  guarantees,  persecution  of 
political  opponents,  curtailment  of  press  freedoms,  use  of  violence  and 
human  rights  violations  and  abuses  in  response  to  antigovernment  protests, 
and  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention  of  antigovernment  protestors,  as  well 
as the exacerbating presence of significant government corruption. The situa-
tion  described  in  Executive  Order  13692  has  not  improved.  Therefore,  in 
accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in 
Executive Order 13692. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9415  of  April  1,  2016 

National  Donate  Life  Month,  2016 

20211 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
By  becoming  an  organ  donor,  one  person  can  save  the  lives  of  up  to  eight 
people  and  improve  the  lives  of  dozens—mothers  and  daughters,  fathers 
and  sons,  brothers  and  sisters—who  are  desperately  in  need  of  a  transplant. 
During  National  Donate  Life  Month,  we  lift  up  the  thousands  of  selfless 
individuals  across  America  who  are  living  or  registered  organ  donors.  And 
as  we  honor  those  who  have  saved  lives  in  the  past  by  donating  organs, 
we recommit to supporting the researchers, innovators, advocates, and med-
ical  professionals  working  to  reduce  the  number  of  people  awaiting  vital 
organ transplants. 
A rising demand for organs exists without enough organs to meet it, making 
the  urgency  for  those  willing  and  able  to  donate  even  more  critical  and 
the  need  for  innovation  and  support  even  more  imperative.  My  Administra-
tion  has  striven  to  support  donors  and  recipients  and  to  expand  the  avail-
ability  of  organs  for  transplant.  In  2010,  the  Department  of  Health  and 
Human Services (HHS), building on efforts within the transplant community, 
launched  a  nationwide  kidney  exchange  program  to  bring  together  pairs 
of  kidney  donors  and  recipients  in  an  effort  to  increase  the  quality  and 
quantity  of  kidney  transplants.  HHS  has  also  made  more  financial  support 
available  to  low-income  living  donors  to  help  cover  expenses  like  travel 
and  lodging  costs  that  are  often  incurred  throughout  the  donation  process. 
The Affordable Care Act offers greater security to living donors by prohibiting 
insurers from denying health coverage to someone with a preexisting condi-
tion—donating  an  organ  may  have  previously  been  considered  a  preexisting 
condition  and  prevented  individuals  from  obtaining  the  care  they  deserved 
after  selflessly  giving  an  organ  to  someone  in  need.  And  in  2013,  I  signed 
the  bipartisan  HOPE  Act,  paving  the  way  for  the  first  transplants  in  the 
United  States  between  HIV-positive  donors  and  recipients—and  the  first 
of these life-saving transplants took place earlier this year. 
Anyone can indicate their desire to be a donor, regardless of age or medical 
history,  and  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  consult  their  family  members 
and communicate their choice. More information on donation and opportuni-
ties to register can be found by visiting www.OrganDonor.gov. 
Through  Medicare,  the  Federal  Government  spends  nearly  $35  billion  each 
year  to  care  for  the  more  than  half  a  million  patients  with  end-stage  kidney 
failure  in  the  United  States.  Increasing  accessibility  to  organs  can  save 
lives  while  helping  to  defray  overall  healthcare  costs.  As  we  work  to  get 
more  people  off  of  the  waiting  list  and  into  the  operating  room  for  a  trans-
plant,  we  are  continuing  to  invest  in  researching  new  and  innovative  ways 
to address this critical issue. Over the span of three recent years, we invested 
nearly  $3  billion  into  regenerative  medicine  research,  and  we  are  making 
great strides in advancing treatment and improving technological capabilities. 
Additionally,  we  have  opened  new  doors  of  collaboration  with  businesses, 
universities,  and  foundations  to  progress  our  prevention,  diagnosis,  and 
treatment  of  infectious  diseases.  Our  Nation  has  taken  bold  steps  in  recent 
years,  and  we  will  continue  working  to  reduce  the  organ  waiting  list  by

building on our efforts to utilize regeneration and other methods for ensuring 
a balance between the supply and demand of vital organs. 
Last  year,  the  United  States  exceeded  30,000  annual  organ  transplants  for 
the  first  time.  Progress  has  been  made  and  great  promise  exists,  but  much 
work remains to help the more than 120,000 Americans on the organ waiting 
list.  This  month,  let  us  remember  those  we  have  lost  and  provide  support 
to all who continue to wait and hope. Across government, industry, academia, 
private  organizations,  and  the  medical  and  philanthropic  communities,  we 
must  all  do  our  part  to  lift  up  donors,  donor  families,  and  patients  by 
supporting efforts to shorten the organ waiting list. Together, we can improve 
and  save  lives  by  celebrating  those  who  give  of  themselves—whether  as 
living  donors  or  as  registered  donors—to  provide  the  greatest  gift  there 
is to offer. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National 
Donate  Life  Month.  I  call  upon  health  care  professionals,  volunteers,  edu-
cators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private 
organizations  to  join  forces  to  boost  the  number  of  organ,  eye,  and  tissue 
donors throughout our Nation. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  first  day  of 
April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence 
of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9541  of  November  10,  2016 

Get  Smart  About  Antibiotics  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Since  their  discovery  nearly  nine  decades  ago,  antibiotics  have  transformed 
the  world  of  modern  medicine.  They  have  been  instrumental  in  combating 
previously  deadly  or  debilitating  illnesses  and  have  saved  countless  lives. 
Yet  the  misuse  of  antibiotics  can  pose  risks  to  public  health.  As  antibiotics 
have  become  more  commonly  prescribed  and  misused  in  all  health  care 
settings,  bacteria  have  developed  the  capability  to  resist  them,  which  can 
undermine their effectiveness. Get Smart About Antibiotics Week is an impor-
tant opportunity to highlight the need to use antibiotics responsibly. 

Antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  cause  tens  of  thousands  of  deaths  each  year 
in  the  United  States  alone,  and  millions  of  Americans  contract  antibiotic- 
resistant  illnesses  that  are  difficult  and  expensive  to  treat.  A  major  factor 
contributing  to  the  emergence  of  antibiotic  resistance  is  the  inappropriate 
use of antibiotics, which are among the most frequently prescribed medicines 
and  are  also  given  to  animals  that  are  used  for  food.  When  a  person  takes 
antibiotics  for  a  bacterial  infection,  bacteria  sensitive  to  that  medicine  are 
generally  destroyed  or  prevented  from  growing  further—but  bacteria  that 
are resistant to that antibiotic will multiply, making current or future bacterial 
infections even worse and harder to treat. When antibiotics are used inappro-
priately,  including  when  they  are  not  needed—such  as  for  treating  viral 
infections  like  the  common  cold,  or  used  in  wrong  doses  or  for  the  wrong 
period  of  time—the  likelihood  of  antibiotic  resistance  is  greatly  increased, 
reducing the effectiveness of these antibiotics in the future. Antibiotic-resist-
ant  bacteria  and  infections  cost  our  country  tens  of  billions  of  dollars  in 
health  care  expenses,  but  more  importantly,  if  we  lose  effective  antibiotic 
options  for  treating  people,  more  patients  will  be  put  at  risk—unless  we 
act now. 

That  is  why  my  Administration  has  taken  action  to  reduce  the  emergence 
and  spread  of  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  and  help  ensure  the  continued 
availability  of  effective  therapeutics  for  the  treatment  of  bacterial  infections. 
In  2014,  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  that  created  the  Task  Force  for  Com-
bating  Antibiotic-Resistant  Bacteria,  established  an  interagency  approach  to 
improve  our  Nation’s  antibiotic  use,  and  built  a  framework  to  strengthen 
surveillance  systems  so  important  data  on  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria  can 
more  easily  be  shared  and  tracked  to  prevent  and  control  infections.  We 
also  launched  the  National  Action  Plan  for  Combating  Antibiotic-Resistant 
Bacteria,  through  which  we  are  working  to  slow  the  emergence  of  resistant 
bacteria  and  accelerate  research  efforts  to  develop  alternative  treatments, 
diagnostic  tools,  and  vaccines.  Last  year,  with  recognition  that  our  public 
health is connected to the health of animals and the environment, especially 
with  regards  to  the  spread  of  disease,  we  hosted  the  White  House  Forum 
on  Antibiotic  Stewardship  to  bring  together  key  human  and  animal  health 
stakeholders to identify successful strategies and opportunities for collabora-
tion. We must continue working with food producers, health care providers, 
leaders  in  the  private  sector,  and  the  American  people  to  improve  our 
antibiotic use.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  221 / Wednesday,  November  16,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

With a sustained commitment to promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics, 
we can address this growing public health problem. In September, the United 
Nations  General  Assembly  pledged  their  commitment  to  international  co-
operation  to  combat  this  global  threat  to  human  health,  development,  and 
security, and heads of states came together to commit to initiating, increasing, 
and  sustaining  awareness  of  antimicrobial  resistance.  This  week,  we  resolve 
to  improve  awareness  of  the  threat  of  antibiotic  resistance  to  our  public 
health,  and  we  encourage  medical  professionals  to  prescribe,  and  patients 
to  use,  antibiotics  responsibly.  Let  us  ensure  that  future  generations  can 
access safe and effective antibiotics, and together let us address the harmful 
effects of antibiotic resistance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 13 through 
November  19,  2016,  as  Get  Smart  About  Antibiotics  Week.  I  call  upon 
the scientific community, medical professionals, educators, businesses, indus-
try leaders, and all Americans to observe this week by promoting the respon-
sible  use  of  antibiotics  and  raising  awareness  of  the  dangers  inherent  in 
their misuse and overuse. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  tenth  day  of 
November, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9392  of  January  29,  2016 

National  African  American  History  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
America’s  greatness  is  a  testament  to  generations  of  courageous  individuals 
who, in the face of uncomfortable truths, accepted that the work of perfecting 
our  Nation  is  unending  and  strived  to  expand  the  reach  of  freedom  to 
all. For too long, our most basic liberties had been denied to African Ameri-
cans,  and  today,  we  pay  tribute  to  countless  good-hearted  citizens—along 
the  Underground  Railroad,  aboard  a  bus  in  Alabama,  and  all  across  our 
country—who  stood  up  and  sat  in  to  help  right  the  wrongs  of  our  past 
and  extend  the  promise  of  America  to  all  our  people.  During  National 
African  American  History  Month,  we  recognize  these  champions  of  justice 
and the sacrifices they made to bring us to this point, we honor the contribu-
tions of African Americans since our country’s beginning, and we recommit 
to reaching for a day when no person is judged by anything but the content 
of their character. 
From  the  Revolutionary  War  through  the  abolitionist  movement,  to  marches 
from  Selma  to  Montgomery  and  across  America  today,  African  Americans 
have  remained  devoted  to  the  proposition  that  all  of  us  are  created  equal, 
even  when  their  own  rights  were  denied.  As  we  rejoice  in  the  victories 
won  by  men  and  women  who  believed  in  the  idea  of  a  just  and  fair 
America, we remember that, throughout history, our success has been driven 
by  bold  individuals  who  were  willing  to  speak  out  and  change  the  status 
quo. 
Refusing  to  accept  our  Nation’s  original  sin,  African  Americans  bound  by 
the  chains  of  slavery  broke  free  and  headed  North,  and  many  others  who 
knew  slavery  was  antithetical  to  our  country’s  conception  of  human  rights 
and  dignity  fought  to  bring  their  moral  imagination  to  life.  When  Jim  Crow 
mocked  the  advances  made  by  the  13th  Amendment,  a  new  generation 
of  men  and  women  galvanized  and  organized  with  the  same  force  of  faith 
as  their  enslaved  ancestors.  Our  Nation’s  young  people  still  echo  the  call 
for  equality,  bringing  attention  to  disparities  that  continue  to  plague  our 
society  in  ways  that  mirror  the  non-violent  tactics  of  the  civil  rights  move-
ment  while  adapting  to  modern  times.  Let  us  also  not  forget  those  who 
made  the  ultimate  sacrifice  so  that  we  could  make  our  voices  heard  by 
exercising  our  right  to  vote.  Even  in  the  face  of  legal  challenges,  every 
eligible  voter  should  not  take  for  granted  what  is  our  right  to  shape  our 
democracy. 
We  have  made  great  progress  on  the  journey  toward  ensuring  our  ideals 
ring  true  for  all  people.  Today,  African  American  high  school  graduation 
and  college  enrollment  rates  are  at  an  all-time  high.  The  African-American 
unemployment  rate  has  been  halved  since  its  Great  Recession  peak.  More 
than  2  million  African  Americans  gained  health  insurance  thanks  to  the 
Affordable  Care  Act.  The  incarceration  rates  for  African-American  men  and 
women  fell  during  each  year  of  this  Administration  and  are  at  their  lowest 
points  in  over  two  decades.  Yet  challenges  persist  and  obstacles  still  stand 
in  the  way  of  becoming  the  country  envisioned  at  our  founding,  and  we 
would  do  a  disservice  to  all  who  came  before  us  if  we  remained  blind 
to  the  way  past  injustices  shape  the  present.  The  United  States  is  home

to  5  percent  of  the  world’s  population,  but  25  percent  of  the  world’s  pris-
oners—a  disproportionate  number  of  whom  are  African  American—so  we 
must  find  ways  to  reform  our  criminal  justice  system  and  ensure  that  it 
is fairer and more effective. While we’ve seen unemployment rates decrease, 
many communities, particularly those of color, continue to experience signifi-
cant  gaps  in  educational  and  employment  opportunities,  causing  too  many 
young  men  and  women  to  feel  like  no  matter  how  hard  they  try,  they 
may never achieve their dreams. 
Our  responsibility  as  citizens  is  to  address  the  inequalities  and  injustices 
that  linger,  and  we  must  secure  our  birthright  freedoms  for  all  people. 
As  we  mark  the  40th  year  of  National  African  American  History  Month, 
let  us  reflect  on  the  sacrifices  and  contributions  made  by  generations  of 
African  Americans,  and  let  us  resolve  to  continue  our  march  toward  a 
day  when  every  person  knows  the  unalienable  rights  to  life,  liberty,  and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

National  African  American  History  Month.  I  call  upon  public  officials,  edu-
cators,  librarians,  and  all  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  this 
month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  January,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of

Proclamation  9400  of  February  29,  2016 

Irish-American  Heritage  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Hailing  from  the  Emerald  Isle,  generations  of  Irishmen  and  women  have 
helped  shape  the  idea  of  America,  overcoming  hardship  and  strife  through 
strength and sacrifice, faith and family. With an undying belief that tomorrow 
always  yields  a  brighter  day,  Irish  Americans  symbolize  the  perpetual  opti-
mism  that  defines  our  country,  and  they  have  long  embodied  the  truth 
at  the  heart  of  our  promise—that  no  matter  who  you  are  or  where  you 
come from, in America, you can make it if you try. 
As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month, we recognize the Irish peo-
ple’s contributions to our country’s dynamism, and we reaffirm the friendship 
and  family  ties  between  our  two  nations.  For  centuries,  sons  and  daughters 
of  Erin  have  come  to  America’s  shores,  adding  to  our  rich  vibrancy  and 
putting their full hearts into everything they do. From building our country’s 
cities  as  preeminent  architects  and  earnest  laborers  to  building  our  national 
character  as  people  of  great  joy  and  cherished  culture,  Irish  Americans 
have  endured  intolerance  and  discrimination  to  find  a  place  for  themselves 
and  their  children  here  in  the  United  States.  While  remembering  the  great 
Irish  Americans  of  the  past,  we  celebrate  what  forms  the  foundation  of 
the lasting Irish-American story—a shared embrace of hard work and humil-
ity,  fairness  and  dignity,  and  a  mutual  quest  to  secure  a  freer  and  more 
peaceful future. 
Today,  the  United  States  and  Ireland  enjoy  a  thriving  and  cooperative  bond 
buoyed  by  a  strong  legacy  of  exchanges  between  our  peoples.  During  Irish- 
American  Heritage  Month,  let  us  pay  tribute  to  the  extraordinary  mark 
Irish  Americans  have  made  on  our  Nation,  and  let  us  look  forward  to 
continued  collaboration,  friendship,  and  partnership  between  our  countries. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2016  as 
Irish-American  Heritage  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9472  of  July  25,  2016 

National  Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

In  1950,  when  Communist  armies  from  the  North  stormed  across  the  38th 
parallel,  brave  American  men  and  women—though  weary  of  combat  in  the 
wake  of  World  War  II—stepped  forward  to  defend  their  brothers  and  sisters 
on  the  Korean  Peninsula.  Over  the  course  of  3  years,  through  unforgiving 
weather  and  severe  danger,  nearly  1.8  million  Americans  joined  in  the 
fight  and  faced  down  Communism—pushing  the  invading  armies  back  and 
protecting  a  people  on  the  other  side  of  the  world.  As  we  mark  the  63rd 
anniversary  of  the  Military  Armistice  Agreement  that  brought  an  end  to 
this  war,  we  pause  to  honor  the  strength  and  resilience  of  our  Korean 
War  veterans,  whose  spirits  and  stories  serve  as  an  inspiration  to  continue 
advancing freedom’s cause. 

Rising  from  occupation  and  ruin,  the  Republic  of  Korea  today  shines  as 
a  thriving,  modern  country,  whose  people  can  take  comfort  in  knowing 
that  the  commitment  of  the  United  States  to  their  stability  and  security 
will never waver. Fifty million South Koreans now live in freedom, reaching 
for  their  dreams  and  pursuing  opportunities  in  a  vibrant  democracy  and 
dynamic  economy—always  realizing  they  have  a  partner  who  will  stand 
shoulder-to-shoulder  with  them  in  defense  of  peace  and  prosperity.  Our 
lasting  friendship  and  unbreakable  alliance  are  sustained  by  the  beliefs 
we hold in common and the values we cherish. 

As  we  pay  tribute  to  the  Americans  who  gallantly  helped  forge  this  bond, 
we  know  our  solemn  responsibilities  to  our  fallen  and  their  loved  ones 
persist long after the battle ends. More than 7,800 Americans are still missing 
from  the  Korean  War,  and  we  will  not  stop  working  to  live  up  to  our 
obligations  to  their  families.  We  owe  all  our  service  members  an  enormous 
debt  of  gratitude.  To  honor  the  full  weight  of  the  sacrifices  made  by  those 
who  serve,  we  must  uphold  our  Nation’s  promise  to  our  veterans  when 
they  return  home,  and  fulfill  our  commitment  to  all  who  wear  the  uniform 
in our name. 

On  National  Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day,  we  pay  tribute  to  the 
American  patriots  who  fought  for  freedom  and  democracy  throughout  the 
Korean  War,  leaving  behind  everyone  they  loved  to  secure  the  blessings 
of  liberty  for  a  country  they  never  knew  and  a  people  they  had  never 
met.  For  the  heavy  price  they  paid,  we  will  forever  honor  the  legacy  of 
their  service  and  uphold  the  ideals  they  secured  through  this  hard-won 
victory. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  July  27,  2016,  as 
National  Korean  War  Veterans  Armistice  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities  that  honor 
our distinguished Korean War veterans.

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9453  of  May  20,  2016 

National  Maritime  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  America’s  founding,  proud  mariners  have  selflessly  dedicated  them-
selves  to  protecting  and  advancing  our  interests—here  at  home  and  around 
the  world.  The  patriots  of  the  United  States  Merchant  Marine  have  long 
served  as  our  Nation’s  ‘‘fourth  arm  of  defense,’’  safeguarding  the  ideals 
that  have  guided  our  country  for  more  than  two  centuries.  They  facilitate 
the  transport  and  trade  of  American  goods,  and  they  put  their  lives  on 
the line in times of war. On National Maritime Day, we honor our Merchant 
Mariners  and  celebrate  their  irreplaceable  role  in  shaping  our  Nation’s  nar-
rative. 
Whether  in  still  or  raging  waters,  Merchant  Mariners  are  fundamental  to 
guaranteeing  the  delivery  of  essential  goods  to  far-reaching  corners  of  our 
globe.  These  seafarers  have  bravely  faced  threats  at  home  and  abroad— 
including  combatants  and  pirates,  disease  outbreaks  and  natural  disasters— 
and  they  consistently  heed  the  call  to  serve  their  fellow  Americans.  In 
World  War  II,  their  ships  carried  troops  and  much-needed  support  to  the 
battlefield,  thousands  making  the  ultimate  sacrifice.  They  were  among  the 
first  to  see  battle,  and  many  were  among  the  last  to  return  home  to  our 
shores. 
Carrying forward a legacy that spans generations, the United States Merchant 
Marine is vital to our Nation’s economic security as well. Their transportation 
of  vital  cargo  has  impacts  far  beyond  America’s  borders,  generating  trillions 
of  dollars  of  economic  activity  each  year.  And  when  our  entrepreneurs 
decide  to  embark  on  new  ventures  across  oceans,  mariners  stand  by  and 
protect their pursuit of the American dream through tireless work to cultivate 
safe  and  open  waterways.  On  this  day,  and  every  day,  let  us  express  our 
sincere  gratitude  to  these  courageous  men  and  women  for  all  they  do  for 
our  Nation,  and  let  us  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  support  them  as  they 
continue to uphold their proud tradition of service. 
The  Congress,  by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  20,  1933,  has  designated 
May  22  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National  Maritime  Day,’’  and  has  authorized  and 
requested  the  President  to  issue  annually  a  proclamation  calling  for  its 
appropriate observance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  22,  2016,  as  National  Maritime  Day. 
I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  mark  this  observance  and 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  at  their  homes  and  in  their  commu-
nities.  I  also  request  that  all  ships  sailing  under  the  American  flag  dress 
ship on this day.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9523  of  October  14,  2016 

National  Character  Counts  Week,  2016 

72475 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our  country  has  survived  centuries  of  trial  and  triumph,  and  we  have 
endured  times  that  have  tested  us  and  marked  moments  of  progress  that 
were  once  deemed  impossible.  Today,  we  live  in  a  time  of  extraordinary 
possibility—and  we  must  decide  how  our  next  chapters  will  be  written. 
The  task  of  shaping  America’s  course  falls  to  each  one  of  us  as  individuals 
who  make  up  our  American  family,  and  as  we  celebrate  National  Character 
Counts  Week,  let  us  seek  to  live  out  the  ideals  that  have  inspired  our 
country’s journey and that define our national character. 
No  matter  who  you  are,  what  you  look  like,  where  you  come  from,  or 
what  your  circumstances  are,  America  should  be  a  place  where  the  things 
that make you unique and different are celebrated. That promise of equality 
and  acceptance  has  been  our  country’s  North  Star  since  its  founding,  and 
in  thinking  of  how  that  centuries-old  ideal  translates  into  our  lives  today, 
it  comes  down  to  all  of  us  showing  others  the  compassion  and  acceptance 
that we would only wish for ourselves. If we seek to understand one another 
and  take  advantage  of  opportunities  to  bring  people  together  across  lines 
of  difference,  we  will  increasingly  realize  as  a  people  that  we  are  more 
alike than we are different. 
Let  us  listen  to  each  other,  see  each  other,  and  recognize  the  common 
humanity  that  makes  America  what  it  is.  Let  us  embrace  the  multitudes 
of  races,  faiths,  cultures,  and  origins  that  make  up  our  diverse,  vibrant 
Nation.  It  will  make  us  better  as  a  people  and  stronger  as  a  country,  and 
it  starts  with  reflecting  on  the  way  we  live  our  lives,  the  way  we  treat 
others,  and  the  example  we  set  for  those  around  us.  We  have  a  collective 
obligation  to  reflect  in  our  own  lives  the  values  we  strive  to  reflect  in 
our  national  life,  and  no  gesture  of  goodwill  is  too  small—together,  ripples 
of  kindness  can  drown  out  voices  of  hate,  wash  away  cynicism  and  doubt, 
and help us see the world in truer colors. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  16  through 
October  22,  2016,  as  National  Character  Counts  Week.  I  call  upon  public 
officials,  educators,  parents,  students,  and  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9517  of  October  7,  2016 

The  President 

Fire  Prevention  Week,  2016 

70909 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
More  than  1  million  fires  occur  each  year  in  the  United  States.  Throughout 
the  past  decade,  the  number  of  fires—and  of  resulting  deaths  and  injuries— 
has  gone  down.  But  residential  fires  still  damage  homes  across  our  country, 
causing  a  higher  percentage  of  fire  deaths,  injuries,  and  economic  loss  than 
any  other  fires,  and  wildfires  continue  to  devastate  our  forests  and  threaten 
nearby  homes  and  businesses.  During  Fire  Prevention  Week,  we  strive  to 
increase our preparedness for fires and commit to giving dedicated firefighters 
the support they need to keep us safe. 
Every  moment  counts  during  a  fire,  and  smoke  alarms  help  save  lives. 
However,  many  people  do  not  know  that  their  smoke  alarms  should  be 
replaced  every  10  years—after  10  years,  they  tend  to  become  unreliable. 
I encourage everyone to check the manufacturing dates of their smoke alarms 
to  see  if  they  need  replacing.  Families  and  businesses  should  also  develop 
and  practice  evacuation  plans  in  case  of  emergencies  and  should  prepare 
communication  strategies  in  case  of  a  fire.  All  Americans  can  learn  more 
about  steps  they  can  take  to  prepare  for  fires  by  visiting  www.Ready.gov. 
In  recent  years,  we  have  experienced  some  of  the  most  severe  wildfire 
seasons  in  American  history,  including  roughly  50,000  wildfires  and  over 
9  million  acres  burned  last  year  alone.  Climate  change  exacerbates  wildfire 
risks  through  drier  landscapes  and  higher  temperatures—we  must  recognize 
the effects our changing climate has on fire risks and help fire professionals 
and community leaders take action to enhance community resilience against 
these  risks.  Last  year,  my  Administration  brought  together  fire  chiefs  from 
around our country to identify key lessons learned from fires at the wildland- 
urban  interface  and  actions  that  can  be  taken  to  reduce  the  harm  to  people 
and  property  associated  with  wildfires  in  these  areas,  where  fighting  fires 
is especially complicated, expensive, and dangerous. We need to be smarter 
about  where  we  build,  and  we  must  work  to  better  understand  how  fires 
behave  so  our  firefighters  can  work  more  safely  and  effectively—we  owe 
these heroic professionals nothing less. 
This  week  presents  opportunities  for  businesses,  families,  and  communities 
to  learn  about  ways  to  protect  themselves  in  case  of  fire  and  helps  raise 
awareness  of  steps  we  can  all  take  to  prevent  fires.  During  Fire  Prevention 
Week, we also pause to honor our first responders and firefighters, including 
those  who  have  sacrificed  their  own  lives  to  save  the  lives  of  people  they 
had  never  met.  Let  us  salute  them  and  pay  tribute  to  all  firefighters  whose

Proclamation  9505  of  September  28,  2016 

National  Arts  and  Humanities  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Throughout  history,  the  arts  and  humanities  have  been  at  the  forefront 
of  progress.  In  diverse  mediums  and  methods—whether  through  the  themes 
of  a  novel,  the  movement  of  a  dancer,  or  a  monologue  on  a  stage—the 
arts  enrich  our  souls,  inspire  us  to  chase  our  dreams,  and  challenge  us 
to  see  things  through  a  different  lens.  During  National  Arts  and  Humanities 
Month, we celebrate the important role the arts and humanities have played 
in shaping the American narrative. 
Our  achievements  as  a  society  and  a  culture  go  hand-in-hand.  The  arts 
embody  who  we  are  as  a  people  and  have  long  helped  drive  the  success 
of  our  country.  They  provoke  thought  and  encourage  our  citizenry  to  reach 
new  heights  in  creativity  and  innovation;  they  lift  up  our  identities,  con-
necting what is most profound within us to our collective human experiences. 
In  seeking  to  break  down  barriers  and  challenge  our  assumptions,  we  must 
continue  promoting  and  prioritizing  the  arts  and  humanities,  especially  for 
our young people. In many ways, the arts and humanities reflect our national 
soul.  They  are  central  to  who  we  are  as  Americans—as  dreamers  and  story-
tellers,  creators  and  visionaries.  By  investing  in  the  arts,  we  can  chart 
a  course  for  the  future  in  which  the  threads  of  our  common  humanity 
are  bound  together  with  creative  empathy  and  openness.  When  we  engage 
with  the  arts,  we  instill  principles  that,  at  their  core,  make  us  truer  to 
ourselves. 
This  month,  we  acknowledge  all  those  who  have  proudly  and  passionately 
dedicated their lives to these diverse, beautiful, and often challenging forms 
of  expression.  In  our  increasingly  global  economy,  we  recognize  the  power 
of the arts and humanities to connect people around the world. Be it through 
the  pen  of  a  poet,  the  voice  of  a  singer,  or  the  canvas  of  a  painter,  let 
us  continue  to  harness  the  unparalleled  ways  the  arts  and  humanities  bring 
people together. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Arts  and  Humanities  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  observe  this  month  with  appropriate  ceremonies,  activities,  and 
programs to celebrate the arts and the humanities in America.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9500  of  September  23,  2016 

National  Hunting  and  Fishing  Day,  2016 

66785 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Hunting  and  fishing  have  endured  as  cherished  traditions  for  generations. 
Whether for sport, sustenance, or both, these activities provide opportunities 
for Americans to connect with those around them—from tribal elders sharing 
sacred  practices  to  parents  spending  time  outdoors  with  their  children. 
On  this  day,  as  we  celebrate  America’s  hunters  and  fishers  for  the  ways 
in  which  they  have  strengthened  our  communities,  we  also  honor  their 
call to serve as good stewards of our lands and waters. 
Anglers  and  hunters  were  some  of  the  earliest  conservation  leaders,  and 
they remain key partners in safeguarding the important recreational opportu-
nities  provided  by  our  unparalleled  natural  spaces.  Caring  for  our  environ-
ment  is  critical  for  supporting  hunting  and  fishing,  and  today  we  recognize 
the growing urgency of conserving our Nation’s lands, waters, and ecosystems 
so  that  more  Americans  can  enjoy  all  they  have  to  offer.  That  is  why 
I  continue  to  call  on  the  Congress  to  permanently  fund  the  Land  and  Water 
Conservation  Fund,  which  has  helped  create  new  opportunities  for  hunting 
and fishing. 
Outdoor  areas  across  America  are  renowned  for  their  beauty  and  for  the 
wealth  of  recreational  activities  they  support.  To  secure  this  legacy,  my 
Administration  has  protected  more  acres  of  public  lands  and  waters  than 
any  other  in  our  Nation’s  history—and  this  past  summer,  I  established 
the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument, which preserves access 
to  hunting.  And  at  national  wildlife  refuges,  in  forests,  and  on  public  and 
private  lands  throughout  our  country,  we  have  expanded  opportunities  for 
Americans to hunt, fish, and reconnect with nature. 
Hunting  and  fishing  strengthen  local  economies,  provide  sustenance,  and 
help  Americans  experience  the  outdoors.  By  enriching  our  communities 
and  bringing  people  together,  hunters  and  anglers  have  carried  forward 
traditions  dating  back  to  long  before  our  Nation’s  founding.  On  National 
Hunting  and  Fishing  Day,  we  recognize  the  majestic  landscapes  that  make 
these  activities  possible  for  Americans  around  our  country.  As  we  acknowl-
edge  the  important  cultural  heritage  surrounding  hunting  and  fishing,  let 
us  vow  to  protect  our  Nation’s  remarkable  outdoor  spaces  for  generations 
to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  24,  2016, 
as  National  Hunting  and  Fishing  Day.  I  invite  all  Americans  to  observe 
this day with appropriate activities in our great outdoors.

Proclamation  9432  of  April  28,  2016 

National  Foster  Care  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  success  of  our  country  tomorrow  depends  on  the  well-being  of  our 
children  today.  As  a  Nation,  we  have  a  duty  to  empower  each  child  so 
they  have  the  same  sense  of  promise  and  possibility  as  any  other  young 
person  no  matter  who  they  are,  where  they  come  from,  or  what  their  cir-
cumstances  are.  Foster  youth  deserve  the  security  and  strong  support  struc-
tures they need to achieve their dreams. During National Foster Care Month, 
we lift up our Nation’s foster children, celebrate the selfless men and women 
who embrace children in the foster care system, and we recommit to helping 
more  children  find  permanency  so  they  can  feel  stable,  grounded,  and  free 
to fulfill their limitless potential. 
With  open  hearts,  families  and  professionals  across  America  work  each 
day  to  give  foster  youth  the  resources,  warmth,  and  care  they  need.  Over 
400,000  children  remain  in  the  foster  care  system,  and  tens  of  thousands 
of  youth  age  out  of  foster  care  before  they  find  their  forever  family.  Only 
half  of  children  in  foster  care  complete  high  school  by  age  18,  and  less 
than  5  percent  graduate  college.  Young  people  who  age  out  of  foster  care 
without  a  permanent  home  are  often  at  higher  risk  of  entering  the  criminal 
justice  system,  and  they  can  face  greater  challenges  to  completing  an  edu-
cation, obtaining high-quality health care, and securing gainful employment. 
We also know kids are better off when raised by loving families, not institu-
tions.  These  difficult  outcomes  are  often  exaggerated  further  when  children 
are placed in group homes. 
I  am  committed  to  preventing  youth  from  falling  into  these  situations.  I 
have  proposed  allowing  child  welfare  agencies  to  use  Federal  funds  to 
provide  critical  services  and  shelter  to  foster  youth  who  have  aged  out 
of  the  system  until  they  are  23.  My  Administration  is  also  working  to 
reduce  abuse  and  neglect  by  focusing  resources  on  strengthening  families 
so  children  stay  out  of  foster  care  in  the  first  place.  Children  living  in 
foster  care  are  more  likely  than  other  children  to  be  overprescribed  medica-
tion for social-emotional and mental health disorders. That is why my Admin-
istration is encouraging greater use of evidence-based screening, assessment, 
and  treatment  of  trauma  and  mental  health  disorders  for  kids  in  foster 
care.  And  because  every  child  deserves  access  to  quality,  affordable  health 
insurance,  the  Affordable  Care  Act  requires  each  State  to  extend  Medicaid 
coverage  to  foster  children  who  have  aged  out  of  the  foster  care  system 
until the age of 26. 
Children  grow  to  become  their  best  selves  when  they  are  surrounded  by 
supportive  families.  Caretakers  support  foster  youth  and  help  them  see  a 
future  of  greater  promise  and  hope.  Last  summer,  the  Supreme  Court  ruled 
that the Constitution guarantees marriage equality, giving more kids in foster 
care  the  opportunity  to  be  part  of  a  loving  family.  My  Administration  will 
continue fighting to ensure eligible and qualified caretakers have the chance 
to  become  an  adoptive  or  foster  parent  regardless  of  race,  religion,  gender 
identity,  or  sexual  orientation.  The  commitment  and  dependability  of  a 
family  can  provide  foster  youth  with  the  confidence  to  write  and  control 
their  own  destiny.  Family  is  the  bedrock  of  the  American  story,  and  we

must  do  everything  we  can  to  support  all  young  people  so  they  can  be 
free  from  harm,  healthy,  and  ready  to  chart  the  course  of  our  Nation’s 
unwritten history. 
When  we  create  environments  for  all  young  people  to  grow  and  flourish 
and  safely  live  as  who  they  are  regardless  of  race,  background,  religion, 
sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity  our  country  is  stronger.  This  month, 
and  every  month,  let  us  pay  tribute  to  the  children  in  foster  care  and 
the  dedicated  parents  and  professionals  who  tirelessly  work  to  shape  their 
lives.  And  as  a  country,  let  us  embrace  the  spirit  that  every  child  matters 
and  continue  working  to  provide  all  of  our  daughters  and  sons  with  an 
equal  chance  to  lead  productive  and  fulfilling  lives,  limited  by  nothing 
but the power of their imaginations and the scope of their dreams.

Foster  Care  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month  by 
taking  time  to  help  youth  in  foster  care  and  recognizing  the  commitment 
of all who touch their lives. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-eighth 
day  of  April,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9429  of  April  27,  2016 

Loyalty  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

America endures because of the generations of our people who have endeav-
ored  alongside  one  another,  joining  their  voices  and  their  efforts  to  ensure 
our  Nation  lives  up  to  its  highest  ideals.  Driven  by  the  determination  to 
continue  making  our  society  more  just  and  more  equal,  our  work  to  fulfill 
our country’s potential has always relied on our willingness to see ourselves 
in our fellow citizens. 

Our  Nation  has  always  been  at  its  finest  when  guided  by  a  spirit  of  shared 
sacrifice  and  common  purpose.  It  is  that  spirit  that  led  a  small  band  of 
patriots  to  declare  our  fledgling  democracy  free  from  the  grasp  of  tyranny, 
that  slaves  and  abolitionists  carried  in  their  hearts  as  they  marched  forward 
on  the  long  journey  toward  freedom,  and  that  guides  the  men  and  women 
who  wear  our  country’s  uniform  in  their  selfless  service.  From  the  unlit 
paths  of  the  Underground  Railroad  to  the  lunch  counters  of  Greensboro, 
the  first  streets  draped  in  the  colors  of  pride  to  the  highest  Court  in  our 
land, we have seen throughout our history that America is inexorably driven 
forward by those who commit themselves to expanding our founding promise 
through  extraordinary  acts  of  courage  and  heroism.  We  honor  that  legacy— 
that  demonstrates  that  the  forces  of  hope  and  love  of  country  are  strong 
enough to overcome even our most deeply entrenched obstacles—by resolving 
to  carry  it  forward,  by  rejecting  appeals  to  prejudice  and  division  in  our 
time, and by drawing on the hopes and dreams that bind us. 

While  ours  has  always  been  a  large  and  complicated  democracy,  full  of 
differing  views  and  boisterous  debates,  our  history  also  makes  clear  that 
we  are  strongest  when  we  find  in  our  diversity  a  deeper,  richer  unity, 
stemming  from  an  overarching  belief  in  the  possibilities  our  shared  future 
holds.  This  Loyalty  Day,  let  us  remember  that  what  defines  us  as  one 
American people is our dedication to common ideals—rather than similarities 
of  origin  or  creed—and  let  us  reaffirm  that  embracing  this  truth  lies  at 
the  heart  of  what  it  means  to  be  a  citizen.  As  long  as  we  stay  true  to 
that  mission  and  uphold  our  responsibility  to  deliver  a  freer,  fairer  Nation 
to  the  next  generation,  a  future  of  ever  greater  progress  will  remain  within 
our reach. 

In  order  to  recognize  the  American  spirit  of  loyalty  and  the  sacrifices  that 
so  many  have  made  for  our  Nation,  the  Congress,  by  Public  Law  85–529 
as  amended,  has  designated  May  1  of  each  year  as  ‘‘Loyalty  Day.’’  On 
this  day,  let  us  reaffirm  our  allegiance  to  the  United  States  of  America 
and pay tribute to the heritage of American freedom.

Proclamation  9530  of  October  27,  2016 

National  Adoption  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Across America, adoptive parents welcome children into stable, loving fami-
lies,  providing  a  safe  and  comforting  place  for  children  in  need  to  call 
home. Families who choose the life-changing path of adoption make a mean-
ingful  and  lasting  difference  in  the  lives  of  some  of  the  most  vulnerable 
young people in our society. Regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, 
race,  or  religion,  devoted  Americans  who  adopt  help  give  more  children 
the  upbringing  they  deserve.  Each  November,  we  recognize  the  important 
role  that  adoption  has  played  in  the  lives  of  children  and  families  in  our 
country  and  around  the  world,  and  we  rededicate  ourselves  to  ensuring 
every child can find their forever family. 
Last  year,  more  than  100,000  children  were  waiting  to  be  adopted  from 
foster  care,  and  every  year,  too  many  older  youth  age  out  of  the  foster 
care  system  before  they  are  able  to  find  permanence.  Without  this  support 
during  the  critical  years  of  early  adulthood,  these  youth  are  more  likely 
than their peers to experience homelessness, unemployment, or incarceration. 
To make the possibility of adoption real for more children across our country, 
my  Administration  has  eliminated  barriers  to  adoption  by  extending  tax 
credits and providing financial incentives to child welfare agencies in almost 
every State to maximize adoptions. I have also worked to strengthen Federal 
workplace  flexibility  policies  to  ensure  more  families,  including  adoptive 
families,  can  keep  their  jobs  and  care  for  their  children  as  their  family 
grows. 
On  the  Saturday  before  Thanksgiving,  we  also  recognize  National  Adoption 
Day, kicking off a week of reflection and gratitude for many adoptive families. 
Each year on this day, thousands of adoptions are finalized, including more 
than  4,000  children  in  2015.  This  year,  cities  from  coast  to  coast  will 
host a variety of events to commemorate the occasion. 
One  of  the  most  important  jobs  many  of  us  will  ever  have  is  being  a 
parent.  Throughout  National  Adoption  Month,  we  celebrate  all  those  who 
have  invited  a  child  in  need  into  their  hearts  and  into  their  homes,  and 
we  express  our  profound  appreciation  for  all  who  help  make  adoptions 
possible.  Let  us  continue  strengthening  the  adoption  process  so  that  all 
children  can  learn,  grow,  and  thrive  with  the  support  of  a  devoted  and 
permanent family. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as  National  Adoption  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
month  by  answering  the  call  to  find  a  permanent  and  caring  family  for 
every  child  in  need  and  by  supporting  the  families  who  care  for  them.

Proclamation  9483  of  September  1,  2016 

National  Childhood  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
More  than  10,000  children  are  diagnosed  with  cancer  each  year.  Although 
rare,  pediatric  cancer  is  the  leading  disease-related  cause  of  death  among 
children. As we invest in cutting-edge research and work to advance medical 
treatments  to  beat  childhood  cancer,  each  of  us  can  help  carry  our  vision 
of  a  cancer-free  future  forward.  Each  September,  we  remember  those  who 
lost  their  lives  to  cancer  far  too  young  and  honor  the  courageous  children 
who  bring  unwavering  strength  and  optimism  to  their  fight  against  cancer 
every  single  day,  and  we  refocus  our  efforts  on  striving  to  cure  cancer 
once and for all. 
Cancer  affects  children  of  all  ages,  generally  without  a  known  cause.  Over 
the  last  half-century,  as  cancer  research  and  treatment  has  advanced,  the 
outlook  for  children  with  cancer  has  greatly  improved.  We  have  witnessed 
tremendous  improvements  in  overall  survival  rates,  and  a  larger  number 
of long-term survivors now look forward to longer life expectancies. Unfortu-
nately,  many  face  chronic  health  challenges  or  complications  after  they 
beat  their  cancer.  As  a  Nation,  we  must  recognize  that  there  is  more  we 
must do to better understand and treat pediatric cancer. 
My  Administration  continues  to  invest  in  the  critical  research  we  need 
to  defeat  this  devastating  disease.  In  2014,  I  signed  the  Gabriella  Miller 
Kids  First  Research  Act,  which  established  the  10-Year  Pediatric  Research 
Initiative  Fund  and  has  already  helped  divert  millions  of  dollars  every 
year to advancing childhood cancer research. Through our Precision Medicine 
Initiative—a  bold  research  effort  to  revolutionize  our  approach  to  treating 
diseases by personalizing treatment based on specific genetic characteristics— 
we  are  already  making  powerful  discoveries  for  cancer  patients  and  looking 
to  transform  the  ways  we  treat  many  types  of  cancer.  And  earlier  this 
year,  I  tasked  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  with  leading  a  new  national  effort 
to  fight  cancer.  The  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot  Task  Force—a  collabo-
rative effort to make a decade’s worth of progress in preventing, diagnosing, 
and  treating  cancer  in  just  5  years—is  working  toward  an  ultimate  goal 
of eliminating cancer as we know it. 
To  give  children  with  cancer  the  care  they  need  and  reduce  the  financial 
burden  that  falls  on  their  families,  we  have  worked  to  provide  quality, 
affordable  health  care  to  all  people.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  has 
helped  millions  of  Americans  access  medical  care  and  enabled  them  to 
receive  regular  checkups,  which  can  help  detect  cancer.  Many  children’s 
cancer  centers  participate  in  clinical  trials,  which  are  partly  responsible 
for much of the progress we have made in advancing treatment of childhood 
cancer; under the ACA, insurers can no longer drop or limit coverage because 
of  participation  in  one  of  these  trials.  The  ACA  eliminated  annual  and 
lifetime limits on insurance coverage, and because the law prevents insurance 
companies  from  denying  or  limiting  coverage  for  pre-existing  conditions, 
children  diagnosed  with  cancer  now  have  a  better  chance  at  a  healthy 
life. 
During  National  Childhood  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  let  us  tell  the  stories 
of  the  brave  children  who  battle  cancer  every  day  and  thank  the  loved

us  renew  our  commitment  to  prevent,  treat,  and  cure  childhood  cancer,

upbringing they deserve.

Proclamation  9513  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Community  Policing  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Police  officers  are  essential  members  of  our  communities—maintaining  our 
way of life depends on their dedicated efforts to keep us safe. These officers 
hold  significant  civic  and  law  enforcement  responsibilities  and  put  their 
lives  at  risk  to  protect  us  each  day,  at  times  facing  some  of  the  most 
adverse circumstances imaginable. The overwhelming majority of police offi-
cers  are  fair,  dedicated,  and  honest  public  servants  who  strive  daily  to 
cultivate and sustain positive relationships with the communities they serve 
and  protect.  As  recent  tragedies  have  illustrated,  however,  it  is  clear  that 
there  are  still  too  many  places  in  America  where  these  relationships  are 
strained  and  where  officers  and  community  members  have  struggled  to 
build and maintain trust. 
During  National  Community  Policing  Week,  we  reaffirm  our  commitment 
to  supporting  and  advancing  the  practice  of  community  policing  and  to 
fortifying  the  bonds  between  police  officers  and  communities.  Community 
policing recognizes that law enforcement cannot solve public safety problems 
alone  and  encourages  interactive  partnerships  with  relevant  stakeholders— 
including community groups, nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and busi-
nesses. This active collaboration can improve public trust and fortify relation-
ships,  not  only  advancing  public  safety,  but  also  deepening  social 
connectivity  and  creating  lasting  solutions  to  challenging  problems  we  face 
every day. 
The underlying tensions that sometimes exist between law enforcement offi-
cers  and  communities  span  decades  and  reflect  a  breadth  of  social  and 
cultural challenges, including racial and socioeconomic disparities. Through 
meaningful  efforts  to  strengthen  community  policing,  we  can  meet  these 
challenges,  improve  these  vital  relationships,  and  make  real  and  lasting 
progress.  Together,  we  can  take  constructive  steps  to  support  our  women 
and men in uniform while instilling confidence in the fairness of the justice 
system  for  everybody  and  ensuring  that  law  enforcement  officers  discharge 
their duties impartially. 
A  critical  part  of  enhancing  trust  is  making  certain  that  when  an  incident 
occurs,  the  public  is  confident  that  an  investigation  is  fair  and  effective— 
both  for  the  officer  and  for  the  families  of  those  who  have  been  affected. 
We must also work with law enforcement on training, hiring, and recruiting 
techniques  and  provide  support  and  proper  resources  as  they  deal  with 
the  challenges  of  the  job.  In  2015,  I  announced  a  Task  Force  on  21st 
Century  Policing  to  bring  together  community  leaders  and  law  enforcement 
to  provide  recommendations  to  help  us  build  the  kind  of  trust  we  need. 
In  the  time  since  the  Task  Force  issued  a  report  of  their  findings,  we 
have  seen  progress  with  respect  to  data  gathering,  training,  transparency, 
and  community  outreach—and  communities  across  America  are  working 
to implement these recommendations. We must also recognize that we cannot 
keep  expecting  police  to  solve  the  issues  we  fail  to  address  as  a  society, 
including  poverty,  substandard  schools,  inadequate  job  opportunities,  and 
lack of care for mental illnesses or substance use disorders; doing so contrib-
utes to unrest in communities and exacerbates tensions.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  194 / Thursday,  October  6,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

My  Administration  has  worked  to  bridge  divides  and  bolster  community 
policing  efforts  across  our  country.  In  2014,  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ) 
launched  the  National  Initiative  for  Building  Community  Trust  and  Justice 
to  invest  in  training,  evidence-based  strategies,  and  research  to  help  reduce 
implicit  bias  and  enhance  procedural  justice  and  reconciliation.  The  DOJ 
has  provided  additional  resources  to  the  Office  of  Community  Oriented 
Policing  Services  for  hiring  police  officers  across  America  and  advancing 
21st-century  policing  efforts.  We  are  also  continuing  to  provide  millions 
of  dollars  in  grants  to  agencies  that  demonstrate  robust  community  policing 
initiatives.  Last  year,  the  White  House  and  the  DOJ  launched  the  Police 
Data  Initiative  to  encourage  law  enforcement,  technologists,  and  researchers 
to  use  data  to  increase  transparency  and  strengthen  accountability  between 
community  members  and  police.  And  this  summer,  we  launched  the  Data- 
Driven  Justice  Initiative  to  equip  law  enforcement  officers  with  the  tools 
they  need  to  safely  and  effectively  divert  low-level  offenders  with  mental 
illnesses  out  of  the  criminal  justice  system.  The  Federal  Government  must 
continue to partner with State and local leaders, as well as the law enforce-
ment  community,  to  expand  best  practices  that  increase  trust  and  public 
safety. 

Every  American  has  the  power  to  make  change  in  their  communities.  By 
working  together  to  improve  law  enforcement  practices  and  ensure  we  give 
both  police  officers  and  community  members  the  respect  they  deserve,  we 
can  fulfill  this  important  endeavor.  This  week,  let  us  rededicate  ourselves 
to  building  a  future  in  which  police  officers  are  honored  for  their  sacrifices 
and supported by their communities and in which members of those commu-
nities  can  truly  feel  they  are  being  served  fairly  and  justly  by  our  women 
and men in blue. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2  through 
October  8,  2016,  as  National  Community  Policing  Week.  I  call  upon  law 
enforcement  agencies,  elected  officials,  and  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
week  by  recognizing  ways  to  improve  public  safety,  rebuild  trust,  and 
strengthen community relationships. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirtieth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

A  Proclamation 
All  children  deserve  to  grow  up  in  a  caring  and  loving  environment,  yet 
across  America,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  children  are  neglected  or  abused 
each  year,  often  causing  lasting  consequences.  Although  effectively  inter-
vening  in  the  lives  of  these  children  and  their  families  is  an  important 
responsibility  at  all  levels  of  government,  preventing  abuse  and  neglect 
is  a  shared  obligation.  During  National  Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month, 
we  recommit  to  giving  every  child  a  chance  to  succeed  and  to  ensuring 
that  every  child  grows  up  in  a  safe,  stable,  and  nurturing  environment 
that is free from abuse and neglect. 
Preventing child abuse is an effort that we must undertake as one American 
family,  and  in  our  schools,  neighborhoods,  and  communities,  we  must  look 
after  every  child  as  if  they  are  our  own.  Between  four  and  eight  children 
die  every  day  from  abuse  or  neglect,  but  together  we  can  prevent  these 
tragedies  from  occurring.  Children  who  are  being  abused  or  neglected  may 
display  constant  alertness,  sudden  changes  in  behavior  and  school  perform-
ance,  or  untreated  physical  or  medical  issues.  Child  abuse  may  take  many 
forms,  including  neglect  and  physical,  sexual,  or  emotional  abuse.  More 
information 
at 
www.ChildWelfare.gov/Preventing. 
All  families  can  benefit  from  strong  support  systems  and  resources  in  the 
face  of  these  challenges,  and  as  parents,  friends,  neighbors,  and  fellow 
human  beings,  keeping  our  kids  safe  is  among  our  highest  priorities.  My 
Administration  is  dedicated  to  fostering  healthy  and  supportive  conditions 
that  enable  our  children  to  develop  and  thrive  and  that  ensure  parents 
and  caretakers  have  the  resources  they  need  to  properly  care  for  their  chil-
dren.  We  are  supporting  efforts  that  lift  up  vulnerable  families,  improve 
the coordination of programs and services within communities, and promote 
meaningful  and  measurable  changes  in  the  lives  of  children  across  America 
to  improve  their  social  and  emotional  well-being.  The  effects  of  child  abuse 
and  neglect  can  negatively  impact  a  child  throughout  their  life.  Together, 
we  must  address  this  issue  so  that  our  children  and  our  children’s  children 
never know the pain caused by child abuse. 
Our  Nation’s  enduring  commitment  to  prevent  child  abuse  and  neglect  de-
mands  that  individuals  and  communities  partner  together  to  provide  safe 
and  nurturing  environments  for  all  of  America’s  daughters  and  sons.  We 
must all join in the work of uplifting and safeguarding our youngest individ-
uals  and  ensuring  they  are  limited  by  nothing  but  the  size  of  their  dreams 
and  the  range  of  their  aspirations.  This  month,  let  us  aim  to  eradicate 
child  abuse  from  our  society,  and  let  us  secure  a  future  for  our  children 
that is bright and full of hope, opportunity, and security. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National 
Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
month with programs and activities that help prevent child abuse and provide 
for children’s physical, emotional, and developmental needs.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9544  of  November  18,  2016 

National  Family  Week,  2016 

85101 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Through  every  passing  generation,  families  have  formed  the  backbone  of 
our  society.  With  pride,  passion,  and  a  commitment  to  their  loved  ones, 
family  members  give  of  themselves  to  create  opportunities  they  never  had 
and  forge  a  brighter  future  for  themselves  and  their  children.  This  week, 
we  honor  the  families  who  have  built  the  America  we  know  today  and 
reaffirm  our  commitment  to  ensuring  every  family  can  have  their  chance 
at a fair shot. 
Nobody  should  have  to  choose  between  spending  time  with  their  family 
and  financially  supporting  them,  and  my  Administration  has  prioritized 
efforts  to  strengthen  families  and  address  the  challenges  we  face  in  our 
workforce.  Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  the  uninsured  rate  has  never 
been  lower,  and  more  families  have  been  able  to  get  quality,  affordable 
health  care.  But  there  is  more  work  to  be  done.  The  United  States  is  the 
only  advanced  country  that  does  not  guarantee  paid  family  or  sick  leave, 
and too often, American workers have to make painful choices about whether 
they  can  afford  to  be  there  when  their  families  need  them  most.  Workers 
also  deserve  fair  work  schedules  that  ensure  predictability  and  certainty. 
And  women  should  be  paid  the  same  as  men  for  doing  the  same  jobs— 
a  principle  that  is  not  just  fair  and  ethical,  but  also  necessary  because 
more women are their family’s main breadwinners than ever before. 
We all have a role to play in lifting up families, and the Federal Government 
is  leading  by  example.  To  help  give  more  families  the  comfort  of  safe 
and  nurturing  child  care,  my  Administration  published  a  new  rule  earlier 
this  year  to  strengthen  quality,  health,  and  safety  standards  for  child  care 
programs.  Earlier  this  year,  I  took  action  to  expand  overtime  protections 
to  more  than  4  million  workers,  and  because  no  one  who  works  full  time 
should  have  to  raise  their  family  in  poverty,  I  have  called  on  the  Congress 
to  raise  the  Federal  minimum  wage—in  the  meantime,  cities,  States,  and 
businesses  across  our  country  have  taken  action,  answering  the  call  to  raise 
the minimum wage and helping American families everywhere. 
Families  of  every  race,  religion,  and  background  have  written  America’s 
story  and  embodied  our  founding  notion:  that  out  of  many,  we  are  one. 
Adoptive  and  foster  families  open  their  hearts  and  their  homes  to  welcome 
children  in  need,  patriotic  military  families  sacrifice  precious  time  with 
their  loved  ones  to  give  us  the  opportunity  to  be  with  ours,  and  last  year, 
the  families  of  gay  and  lesbian  couples  who  fought  so  long  for  basic  civil 
rights were finally recognized as equal under the law. 
Through  challenging  moments  and  difficult  times,  America’s  families  are 
representative  of  the  strength  and  unity  at  the  core  of  our  communities. 
Their  love  is  an  enduring  reminder  of  what  is  best  about  our  country. 
This week, let us celebrate the devotion of dedicated family members across 
our Nation and pledge to give them the support they need to thrive. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 20 through

Proclamation  9490  of  September  9,  2016 

National  Grandparents  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  day,  families  and  communities  across  the  globe  benefit  from  the 
too  often  unheralded  wisdom  and  devotion  of  dedicated  grandparents— 
women  and  men  who  blazed  trails,  broke  down  barriers,  and  shaped  the 
world  we  know  today.  On  National  Grandparents  Day,  we  honor  America’s 
grandparents  as  the  backbone  of  our  communities,  and  acknowledge  the 
progress  they  forged  so  that  their  children  and  grandchildren  could  live 
out their dreams. 
In our grandmothers and grandfathers, we see a reflection of what is possible 
with  hard  work,  grit,  and  determination.  Their  fight  for  inclusivity  and 
opportunity  for  all  can  be  seen  in  board  rooms  and  courthouses  across 
our country, and their efforts helped build the world’s largest, most durable 
economy and strongest middle class. This enduring legacy spans generations 
and will empower innovators and leaders for years to come. 
Some  grandparents  sacrificed  everything,  leaving  behind  all  they  knew  and 
loved  to  fight  for  freedom  far  from  home,  or  to  start  a  new  life  and  give 
their  families  a  chance  at  a  brighter  tomorrow  in  America.  Millions  of 
grandparents serve as primary caregivers, providing the discipline, guidance, 
and  encouragement  needed  to  thrive.  And  for  so  many  Americans,  our 
grandparents  are  our  heroes,  our  confidantes,  and  our  fiercest  advocates. 
As  connections  to  our  past  and  inspirations  for  our  future,  grandparents 
made  us  who  we  are  today  and  have  paved  a  path  we  can  aspire  to  follow. 
Today,  we  pause  to  reflect  not  only  on  the  myriad  ways  our  grandparents 
have enriched our lives with their selfless acts of compassion and kindness, 
but  also  on  our  responsibility  to  ensure  they  can  retire  as  they  deserve— 
with  security  and  dignity.  Let  us  recognize  their  lasting  contributions  to 
their  families  and  communities,  and  let  us  express  our  gratitude  for  all 
they have made possible. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  11,  2016, 
as  National  Grandparents  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  take  the  time 
to honor their own grandparents and those in their community.

Notice  of  September  15,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Per-
sons  Who  Commit,  Threaten  To  Commit,  or  Support  Ter-
rorism 

On  September  23,  2001,  by  Executive  Order  13224,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  persons  who  commit,  threaten  to 
commit,  or  support  terrorism,  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Eco-
nomic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and 
extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  grave  acts  of  terrorism  and  threats 
of  terrorism  committed  by  foreign  terrorists,  including  the  terrorist  attacks 
on  September  11,  2001,  in  New  York  and  Pennsylvania  and  against  the 
Pentagon, and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks against 
United States nationals or the United States. 

The actions of persons who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism 
continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the 
national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13224  of  September  23, 
2001,  and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency, 
must continue in effect beyond September 23, 2016. Therefore, in accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  persons 
who commit, threaten to commit, or support terrorism declared in Executive 
Order 13224. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9386  of  December  31,  2015 

National  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking  Prevention  Month, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
One hundred and fifty years ago, our Nation codified the fundamental truth 
that  slavery  is  an  affront  to  human  dignity.  Still,  the  bitter  fact  remains 
that  millions  of  men,  women,  and  children  around  the  globe,  including 
here at home, are subject to modern-day slavery: the cruel, inhumane practice 
of human trafficking. This month, we rededicate ourselves to assisting victims 
of human trafficking and to combating it in all its forms. 
Human trafficking occurs in countries throughout the world and in commu-
nities  across  our  Nation.  Children  are  forced  to  fight  as  soldiers,  young 
people  are  coerced  into  prostitution,  and  migrants  are  exploited.  People 
from  all  walks  of  life  are  trafficked  every  day,  and  the  United  States  is 
committed to remaining a leader in the global movement to end this abhorrent 
practice.  My  Administration  has  made  addressing  human  trafficking  issues 
in  supply  chains  a  priority.  Earlier  this  year,  the  White  House  brought 
together  private  sector  and  non-governmental  organizations  to  discuss  ways 
to  prevent  and  eliminate  trafficking-related  activities  in  Federal  contracts 
and  in  private  sector  supply  chains.  Our  National  Convening  on  Trafficking 
and  Child  Welfare  helped  promote  partnership  and  establish  coordinated 
action  plans  to  end  human  trafficking.  Additionally,  my  Interagency  Task 
Force  to  Monitor  and  Combat  Trafficking  in  Persons  has  proposed  a  robust 
set of initiatives. Our anti-trafficking efforts are supported by a newly estab-
lished  Federal  Office  on  Trafficking  in  Persons,  under  the  Department  of 
Health  and  Human  Services,  which  helps  ensure  trafficking  victims  can 
access the services they need. 
As  we  work  to  end  human  trafficking  here  in  the  United  States,  we  will 
continue  to  lead  the  effort  to  root  it  out  around  the  world.  Our  intelligence 
teams  have  devoted  more  resources  to  identifying  trafficking  networks,  law 
enforcement  officers  have  been  working  to  dismantle  those  networks,  and 
prosecutors  have  striven  to  punish  traffickers.  We  have  also  enhanced  our 
domestic  protections  so  foreign-born  workers  better  understand  their  rights. 
Additionally,  my  Administration  has  been  working  closely  with  technology 
companies and law enforcement to better utilize technology to combat human 
trafficking.  And  our  Nation  will  continue  promoting  development  and  eco-
nomic  growth  across  the  globe  to  address  the  underlying  conditions  that 
enable human trafficking in the first place. 
All  nations  have  a  part  to  play  in  keeping  our  world  safe  for  all  people— 
regardless of age, background, or belief. During National Slavery and Human 
Trafficking  Prevention  Month,  let  us  recognize  the  victims  of  trafficking, 
and  let  us  resolve  to  build  a  future  in  which  its  perpetrators  are  brought 
to  justice  and  no  people  are  denied  their  inherent  human  rights  of  freedom 
and dignity. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  2016  as 
National  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking  Prevention  Month,  culminating 
in  the  annual  celebration  of  National  Freedom  Day  on  February  1.  I  call

Executive  Order  13725  of  April  15,  2016 

Steps  to  Increase  Competition  and  Better  Inform  Consumers 
and  Workers  to  Support  Continued  Growth  of  the  American 
Economy 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  protect  American 
consumers  and  workers  and  encourage  competition  in  the  U.S.  economy, 
it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Maintaining,  encouraging,  and  supporting  a  fair,  efficient, 
and  competitive  marketplace  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  American  economy. 
Consumers  and  workers  need  both  competitive  markets  and  information 
to make informed choices. 
Certain  business  practices  such  as  unlawful  collusion,  illegal  bid  rigging, 
price  fixing,  and  wage  setting,  as  well  as  anticompetitive  exclusionary  con-
duct  and  mergers  stifle  competition  and  erode  the  foundation  of  America’s 
economic  vitality.  The  immediate  results  of  such  conduct—higher  prices 
and  poorer  service  for  customers,  less  innovation,  fewer  new  businesses 
being  launched,  and  reduced  opportunities  for  workers—can  impact  Ameri-
cans in every walk of life. 
Competitive markets also help advance national priorities, such as the deliv-
ery  of  affordable  health  care,  energy  independence,  and  improved  access 
to fast and affordable broadband. Competitive markets also promote economic 
growth,  which  creates  opportunity  for  American  workers  and  encourages 
entrepreneurs to start innovative companies that create jobs. 
The  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC) 
have  a  proven  record  of  detecting  and  stopping  anticompetitive  conduct 
and challenging mergers and acquisitions that threaten to consolidate markets 
and reduce competition. 
Promoting  competitive  markets  and  ensuring  that  consumers  and  workers 
have  access  to  the  information  needed  to  make  informed  choices  must 
be  a  shared  priority  across  the  Federal  Government.  Executive  departments 
and  agencies  can  contribute  to  these  goals  through,  among  other  things, 
pro-competitive  rulemaking  and  regulations,  and  by  eliminating  regulations 
that  create  barriers  to  or  limit  competition.  Such  Government-wide  action 
is  essential  to  ensuring  that  consumers,  workers,  startups,  small  businesses, 
and farms reap the full benefits of competitive markets. 
Sec. 2. Agency Responsibilities. (a) Executive departments and agencies with 
authorities that could be used to enhance competition (agencies) shall, where 
consistent  with  other  laws,  use  those  authorities  to  promote  competition, 
arm consumers and workers with the information they need to make informed 
choices,  and  eliminate  regulations  that  restrict  competition  without  cor-
responding benefits to the American public. 

(b)  Agencies  shall  identify  specific  actions  that  they  can  take  in  their 
areas  of  responsibility  to  build  upon  efforts  to  detect  abuses  such  as  price 
fixing,  anticompetitive  behavior  in  labor  and  other  input  markets,  exclu-
sionary  conduct,  and  blocking  access  to  critical  resources  that  are  needed 
for  competitive  entry.  Behaviors  that  appear  to  violate  our  antitrust  laws 
should be referred to antitrust enforcers at DOJ and the FTC. Such a referral 
shall not preclude further action by the referring agency against that behavior 
under that agency’s relevant statutory authority.

(c)  Agencies  shall  also  identify  specific  actions  that  they  can  take  in 
their  areas  of  responsibility  to  address  undue  burdens  on  competition.  As 
permitted  by  law,  agencies  shall  consult  with  other  interested  parties  to 
identify ways that the agency can promote competition through pro-competi-
tive  rulemaking  and  regulations,  by  providing  consumers  and  workers  with 
information they need to make informed choices, and by eliminating regula-
tions that restrict competition without corresponding benefits to the American 
public. 

(d)  Not  later  than  30  days  from  the  date  of  this  order,  agencies  shall 
submit  to  the  Director  of  the  National  Economic  Council  an  initial  list 
of (1) actions each agency can potentially take to promote more competitive 
markets;  (2)  any  specific  practices,  such  as  blocking  access  to  critical  re-
sources,  that  potentially  restrict  meaningful  consumer  or  worker  choice  or 
unduly  stifle  new  market  entrants,  along  with  any  actions  the  agency  can 
potentially  take  to  address  those  practices;  and  (3)  any  relevant  authorities 
and  tools  potentially  available  to  enhance  competition  or  make  information 
more widely available for consumers and workers. 

(e)  Not  later  than  60  days  from  the  date  of  this  order,  agencies  shall 
report to the President, through the Director of the National Economic Coun-
cil,  recommendations  on  agency-specific  actions  that  eliminate  barriers  to 
competition,  promote  greater  competition,  and  improve  consumer  access 
to  information  needed  to  make  informed  purchasing  decisions.  Such  rec-
ommendations shall include a list of priority actions, including rulemakings, 
as well as timelines for completing those actions. 

(f)  Subsequently,  agencies  shall  report  semi-annually  to  the  President, 
through the Director of the National Economic Council, on additional actions 
that they plan to undertake to promote greater competition. 

(g)  Sections  2(d),  2(e),  and  2(f)  of  this  order  do  not  require  reporting 

of information related to law enforcement policy and activities. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent 
with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(b)  Independent  agencies  are  strongly  encouraged  to  comply  with  the 

requirements of this order. 

(c)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed  to  impair  or  otherwise  affect: 
(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  a  department  or  agency,  or  the  head 
thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.

Notice  of  March  2,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Ukraine 

On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, I declared a national emergency 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions 
and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions 
in  Ukraine;  threaten  its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial 
integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On  March  16,  2014,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13661,  which  expanded  the 
scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13660,  and 
found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federa-
tion with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions 
in  Ukraine;  threaten  its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial 
integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On March 20, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded 
the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13660, 
as  expanded  in  scope  in  Executive  Order  13661,  and  found  that  the  actions 
and  policies  of  the  Government  of  the  Russian  Federation,  including  its 
purported  annexation  of  Crimea  and  its  use  of  force  in  Ukraine,  continue 
to  undermine  democratic  processes  and  institutions  in  Ukraine;  threaten 
its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial  integrity;  and  con-
tribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On  December  19,  2014,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13685,  to  take  additional 
steps  to  address  the  Russian  occupation  of  the  Crimea  region  of  Ukraine. 
The  actions  and  policies  addressed  in  these  Executive  Orders  continue  to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared 
on  March  6,  2014,  and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date,  on  March  16, 
2014,  on  March  20,  2014,  and  December  19,  2014,  to  deal  with  that  emer-
gency,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  March  6,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accord-
ance with section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order 13660.

Proclamation  9557  of  December  16,  2016 

Wright  Brothers  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  December  17,  1903,  two  brothers  from  Dayton,  Ohio  successfully  flew 
the  world’s  first  powered  aircraft.  The  plane  remained  airborne  for  only 
12  seconds,  but  Orville  and  Wilbur  Wright’s  innovative  legacy  has  endured 
for  generations—unleashing  unparalleled  possibilities  and  forever  trans-
forming our way of life. On Wright Brothers Day, we celebrate the determina-
tion  and  ingenuity  that  drove  their  pursuit  and  recommit  to  shaping  the 
future through our ideas and discoveries. 
As  self-taught  mechanics,  the  Wright  brothers  devoted  years  to  research 
and  experimentation  before  taking  their  talents  and  creativity  to  the  strong 
winds  above  Kitty  Hawk,  North  Carolina,  where  they  completed  the  monu-
mental  first  flight.  Their  mother,  Susan,  spent  considerable  time  in  her 
youth designing and building mechanical appliances; she guided her children 
whenever  she  could  and  always  encouraged  them  to  chase  their  curiosities. 
As  Orville  and  Wilbur  grew,  they  followed  their  entrepreneurial  instincts, 
launching a newspaper and later opening a bicycle shop to sell their designs. 
Their  resilience  through  early  failed  attempts  at  flight,  and  their  resolve 
to  dream  big  in  the  face  of  that  which  had  never  been  done  before,  still 
serves as an inspiration. 
Our  capacity  to  harness  new  inventions  and  technologies  to  tackle  our 
greatest  challenges  has  allowed  our  Nation  to  lead  the  world  in  innovation. 
From  sending  people  into  the  skies  and  outer  space  to  finding  ways  to 
instantly  communicate  with  others  across  the  globe,  the  creativity  inherent 
in  our  DNA  and  our  commitment  to  science  have  sparked  our  progress 
and  set  us  apart.  The  same  American  spirit  of  innovation  that  led  the 
Wright  brothers  to  test  their  theories  again  and  again—finding  ways  to 
make  things  work  and  then  make  them  even  better—is  still  reflected  in 
the  imagination  and  tenacity  that  move  inventors  and  explorers  to  push 
the  frontiers  of  what  is  known  and  achieve  groundbreaking  feats  that  were 
once unimaginable. 
In  upholding  this  legacy,  we  must  resolve  to  help  all  young  Americans 
understand that they can have a place in advancing science and technology— 
regardless  of  their  race,  gender,  or  circumstances.  Brilliant  ideas  can  come 
from anyone and anywhere, and it is our obligation to increase the availability 
of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) training and encourage 
the  next  generation  to  pursue  STEM  careers.  This  commitment  to  science 
and  innovation  can  revitalize  our  communities  and  economies  and  reignite 
our shared sense of optimism and opportunity. 
Today,  we  reflect  on  the  century  of  flight  the  Wright  brothers  helped  make 
possible.  Their  story  reminds  us  not  just  of  where  we  have  been,  but  where 
we  still  can  go  when  we  foster  ingenuity  and  discovery  and  refuse  to 
accept the sky as the limit. With the right investments and the perseverance 
of  dreamers  and  doers  who  see  a  challenge  and  yearn  to  find  a  solution, 
there is nothing we cannot achieve. 
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, as amended 
(77  Stat.  402;  36  U.S.C.  143),  has  designated  December  17  of  each  year 
as  ‘‘Wright  Brothers  Day’’  and  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9658  of  October  10,  2017 

The  President 

General  Pulaski  Memorial  Day,  2017 

48191 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Today, we commemorate General Casimir Pulaski, a Polish immigrant whose 
heroic  contributions  to  the  American  Revolutionary  War  helped  shape  our 
Nation’s  history.  Known  as  the  ‘‘Father  of  the  American  Cavalry,’’  General 
Pulaski  demonstrated  bravery  as  a  soldier  and  exceptional  leadership  as 
a  military  officer.  General  Pulaski  is  internationally  renowned  for  having 
supported  and  fought  for  independence  and  freedom,  both  in  his  native 
Poland and in the United States. 
Born  into  Polish  nobility,  General  Pulaski  and  his  family  fought  to  preserve 
a  free  and  self-governing  Poland.  Exiled  from  his  country  after  a  failed 
uprising  against  Russian  control  of  Poland,  the  Marquis  de  Lafayette  and 
Benjamin  Franklin  recruited  General  Pulaski  to  join  the  fight  for  freedom 
in  the  American  Revolution.  During  his  first  military  engagement  with  the 
British, at the Battle of Brandywine, General Pulaski led a courageous charge 
that  averted  a  defeat  of  the  American  cavalry,  saving  the  life  of  General 
George  Washington  and  earning  him  the  rank  of  Brigadier  General  in  the 
United States Continental Army. 
General  Pulaski  gave  his  complete  devotion  to  the  American  cause  for  free-
dom.  He  spent  the  harsh  winter  that  ran  from  1777  into  1778  at  Valley 
Forge  with  General  Washington,  and  used  his  own  personal  finances  to 
supply his cavalry legion when resources were scarce. Fatefully, on October 
9,  1779,  General  Pulaski  was  severely  wounded  leading  a  daring  charge 
against  British  forces,  this  time  in  the  Battle  of  Savannah.  General  Pulaski 
died shortly thereafter, paying the ultimate sacrifice for his adopted American 
compatriots. 
General  Pulaski  once  wrote  to  General  Washington:  ‘‘I  came  here,  where 
freedom is being defended, to serve it, and to live or die for it.’’ In recognition 
of  his  selfless  devotion  to  our  country  and  its  cause,  the  Congress,  in 
2009,  granted  honorary  citizenship  to  General  Pulaski,  one  of  only  eight 
people  ever  to  have  earned  this  distinction.  He  is  an  example  for  all  those 
who love freedom and seek the courage to defend it. 
General  Pulaski’s  defense  of  the  Polish-American  values  of  liberty,  the  rule 
of law, and the sovereignty of the people symbolizes the close bond between 
the  United  States  and  Poland.  We  have  helped  one  another  in  the  most 
challenging  of  times,  from  the  American  Revolution  to  the  Polish  liberation 
from  communism.  Today,  our  strong  bilateral  relationship  with  Poland, 
forged  initially  by  remarkable  individuals  like  General  Pulaski,  continues 
to  enhance  the  important  security,  economic,  and  social  ties  that  help  bring 
prosperity to both countries. 
More  than  200  years  after  General  Pulaski’s  heroic  death,  there  are  9.5 
million  Americans  of  Polish  descent.  They  carry  forward  General  Pulaski’s 
legacy  by  protecting  our  shared  values,  strengthening  our  cultural  heritage, 
and  serving  in  our  Armed  Forces.  They  remind  us  that  the  story  of  Poland, 
like  the  story  of  America,  is  of  a  people  who  have  never  lost  hope,  have 
never been broken, and have never forgotten who they are.

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  11,  2017,

Presidential Documents

28743 

Notice  of  June  21,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
North  Korea 

On  June  26,  2008,  by  Executive  Order  13466,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency with respect to North Korea pursuant to the International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  existence  and  risk  of  proliferation 
of  weapons-usable  fissile  material  on  the  Korean  Peninsula.  The  President 
also found that it was necessary to maintain certain restrictions with respect 
to North Korea that would otherwise have been lifted pursuant to Proclama-
tion  8271  of  June  26,  2008,  which  terminated  the  exercise  of  authorities 
under  the  Trading  With  the  Enemy  Act  (50  U.S.C.  App.  1–44)  with  respect 
to North Korea. 
On  August  30,  2010,  the  President  signed  Executive  Order  13551,  which 
expanded  the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13466  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national 
security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States  posed  by  the 
continued actions and policies of the Government of North Korea, manifested 
by  its  unprovoked  attack  that  resulted  in  the  sinking  of  the  Republic  of 
Korea  Navy  ship  Cheonan  and  the  deaths  of  46  sailors  in  March  2010; 
its  announced  test  of  a  nuclear  device  and  its  missile  launches  in  2009; 
its actions in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 
and  1874,  including  the  procurement  of  luxury  goods;  and  its  illicit  and 
deceptive  activities  in  international  markets  through  which  it  obtains  finan-
cial  and  other  support,  including  money  laundering,  the  counterfeiting  of 
goods  and  currency,  bulk  cash  smuggling,  and  narcotics  trafficking,  which 
destabilize  the  Korean  Peninsula  and  imperil  United  States  Armed  Forces, 
allies, and trading partners in the region. 
On  April  18,  2011,  the  President  signed  Executive  Order  13570  to  take 
additional  steps  to  address  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order  13466  and  expanded  in  Executive  Order  13551  that  would  ensure 
the  implementation  of  the  import  restrictions  contained  in  United  Nations 
Security  Council  Resolutions  1718  and  1874  and  complement  the  import 
restrictions  provided  for  in  the  Arms  Export  Control  Act  (22  U.S.C.  2751 
et seq.). 
On  January  2,  2015,  the  President  signed  Executive  Order  13687  to  expand 
the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13466, 
expanded  in  Executive  Order  13551,  and  addressed  further  in  Executive 
Order  13570,  to  address  the  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy, 
and  economy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  provocative,  desta-
bilizing,  and  repressive  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  North 
Korea, including its destructive, coercive cyber-related actions during Novem-
ber  and  December  2014,  actions  in  violation  of  United  Nations  Security 
Council Resolutions 1718, 1874, 2087, and 2094, and commission of serious 
human rights abuses. 
On  March  15,  2016,  the  President  signed  Executive  Order  13722  to  take 
additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive 
Order  13466,  as  modified  in  scope  and  relied  upon  for  additional  steps 
in subsequent Executive Orders, to address the Government of North Korea’s 
continuing  pursuit  of  its  nuclear  and  missile  programs,  as  evidenced  by

with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  North 
Korea declared in Executive Order 13466. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

The  President

Proclamation  9617  of  May  24,  2017 

Prayer  for  Peace,  Memorial  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Memorial  Day  is  our  Nation’s  solemn  reminder  that  freedom  is  never  free. 
It  is  a  moment  of  collective  reflection  on  the  noble  sacrifices  of  those 
who  gave  the  last  measure  of  devotion  in  service  of  our  ideals  and  in 
the  defense  of  our  Nation.  On  this  ceremonious  day,  we  remember  the 
fallen,  we  pray  for  a  lasting  peace  among  nations,  and  we  honor  these 
guardians of our inalienable rights. 
This  year,  we  commemorate  the  centennial  anniversary  of  America’s  entry 
into  World  War  I.  More  than  4.7  million  Americans  served  during  The 
Great  War,  representing  more  than  25  percent  of  the  American  male  popu-
lation  between  the  ages  of  18  and  31  at  the  time.  We  remember  the  more 
than  100,000  Americans  who  sacrificed  their  lives  during  ‘‘The  War  to 
End  All  Wars,’’  and  who  left  behind  countless  family  members  and  loved 
ones. We pause again to pray for the souls of those heroes who, one century 
ago, never returned home after helping to restore peace in Europe. 
On  Memorial  Day  we  honor  the  final  resting  places  of  the  more  than  one 
million  men  and  women  who  sacrificed  their  lives  for  our  Nation,  by  deco-
rating  their  graves  with  the  stars  and  stripes,  as  generations  have  done 
since  1868.  We  also  proudly  fly  America’s  beautiful  flag  at  our  homes, 
businesses,  and  in  our  community  parades  to  honor  their  memory.  In  doing 
so,  we  pledge  our  Nation’s  allegiance  to  the  great  cause  of  freedom  for 
which they fought and ultimately died. 
In  honor  and  recognition  of  all  of  our  fallen  service  members,  the  Congress, 
by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  11,  1950,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  116), 
has  requested  the  President  issue  a  proclamation  calling  on  the  people 
of  the  United  States  to  observe  each  Memorial  Day  as  a  day  of  prayer 
for  permanent  peace  and  designating  a  period  on  that  day  when  the  people 
of  the  United  States  might  unite  in  prayer.  The  Congress,  by  Public  Law 
106–579,  has  also  designated  3:00  p.m.  local  time  on  that  day  as  a  time 
for  all  Americans  to  observe,  in  their  own  way,  the  National  Moment  of 
Remembrance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  Memorial  Day,  May  29,  2017,  as  a  day 
of  prayer  for  permanent  peace,  and  I  designate  the  hour  beginning  in  each 
locality  at  11:00  a.m.  of  that  day  as  a  time  when  people  might  unite  in 
prayer.  I  urge  the  press,  radio,  television,  and  all  other  information  media 
to cooperate in this observance. 
I further ask all Americans to observe the National Moment of Remembrance 
beginning at 3:00 p.m. local time on Memorial Day. 
I  also  request  the  Governors  of  the  United  States  and  its  Territories,  and 
the  appropriate  officials  of  all  units  of  government,  to  direct  that  the  flag 
be  flown  at  half-staff  until  noon  on  this  Memorial  Day  on  all  buildings, 
grounds,  and  naval  vessels  throughout  the  United  States  and  in  all  areas 
under  its  jurisdiction  and  control.  I  also  request  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  display  the  flag  at  half-staff  from  their  homes  for  the  customary 
forenoon period.

Executive  Order  13779  of  February  28,  2017 

White  House  Initiative  To  Promote  Excellence  and  Innovation 
at  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, and in order to advance opportunities 
in higher education, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Historically  black  colleges  and  universities  (HBCUs)  have 
made,  and  continue  to  make,  extraordinary  contributions  to  the  general 
welfare  and  prosperity  of  our  country.  Established  by  visionary  leaders, 
America’s  HBCUs  have,  for  more  than  150  years,  produced  many  of  our 
Nation’s  leaders  in  business,  government,  academia,  and  the  military,  and 
have helped create a black middle class. The Nation’s more than 100 HBCUs 
are  located  in  20  States,  the  District  of  Columbia,  and  the  U.S.  Virgin 
Islands,  and  serve  more  than  300,000  undergraduate,  graduate,  and  profes-
sional students. These institutions are important engines of economic growth 
and public service, and they are proven ladders of intergenerational advance-
ment. 
A  White  House  Initiative  on  HBCUs  would:  advance  America’s  full  human 
potential; foster more and better opportunities in higher education; strengthen 
the  capacity  of  HBCUs  to  provide  the  highest-quality  education;  provide 
equitable  opportunities  for  HBCUs  to  participate  in  Federal  programs;  and 
increase  the  number  of  college-educated  Americans  who  feel  empowered 
and able to advance the common good at home and abroad. 
Sec. 2. White House Initiative on HBCUs. 

(a)  Establishment.  There  is  established  the  White  House  Initiative  on  His-
torically Black Colleges and Universities (Initiative), housed in the Executive 
Office  of  the  President  and  led  by  an  Executive  Director  designated  by 
the President. 

(b) Mission and Functions. The Initiative shall work with agencies, private- 
sector  employers,  educational  associations,  philanthropic  organizations,  and 
other  partners  to  increase  the  capacity  of  HBCUs  to  provide  the  highest- 
quality  education  to  an  increasing  number  of  students.  The  Initiative  shall 
have two primary missions: 

(i)  increasing  the  private-sector  role,  including  the  role  of  private  founda-
tions, in: 

(A)  strengthening  HBCUs  through  enhanced  institutional  planning  and 

development, fiscal stability, and financial management; and 

(B)  upgrading  institutional  infrastructure,  including  the  use  of  tech-

nology, to ensure the long-term viability of these institutions; and 
(ii)  enhancing  HBCUs’  capabilities  to  serve  our  Nation’s  young  adults 
by: 

(A)  strengthening  HBCUs’  ability  to  equitably  participate  in  Federal 
programs  and  exploring  new  ways  of  improving  the  relationship  between 
the Federal Government and HBCUs; 

(B)  fostering  private-sector  initiatives  and  public-private  partnerships 
while  promoting  specific  areas  and  centers  of  academic  research  and  pro-
gram-based excellence throughout HBCUs;

shall address, among other things, the agency’s proposed efforts to: 

(A) establish how the agency intends to increase the capacity of HBCUs 
to  compete  effectively  for  grants,  contracts,  or  cooperative  agreements;

initiatives; and 

(C)  encourage  public-sector,  private-sector,  and  community  involvement 

in improving the overall capacity of HBCUs.

Agency Plan annually thereafter. 
(iv)  To  help  fulfill  the  objectives  of  the  Agency  Plans,  the  head  of  each 
agency  identified  by  the  Secretary  may  provide,  as  appropriate,  technical 
assistance  and  information  to  the  Executive  Director  to  enhance  commu-
nication  with  HBCUs  concerning  the  agency’s  program  activities  and  the 
preparation of applications or proposals for grants, contracts, or cooperative 
agreements. 
(v)  Each  agency  identified  by  the  Secretary  shall  appoint  a  senior  official 
to  report  directly  to  the  agency  head  on  that  agency’s  progress  under 
this order, and to serve as liaison to the Initiative. 
(d) Interagency Working Group. There is established an Interagency Work-
ing  Group,  which  shall  be  chaired  by  the  Executive  Director  and  shall 
consist  of  one  representative  from  each  agency  identified  by  the  Secretary 
pursuant  to  subsection  (c)(i)  of  this  section,  to  help  advance  and  coordinate 
the work required by this order. 
Sec. 3. President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs.

tor,  representatives  of  a  variety  of  sectors—such  as  philanthropy,  education,

Director.  The  Chair  shall  also  consult  with  the  Executive  Director  regarding

Memorandum  of  January  24,  2017 

Construction  of  the  Dakota  Access  Pipeline 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  the  Army 

Section  1.  Policy.  The  Dakota  Access  Pipeline  (DAPL)  under  development 
by  Dakota  Access,  LLC,  represents  a  substantial,  multi-billion-dollar  private 
investment  in  our  Nation’s  energy  infrastructure.  This  approximately  1,100- 
mile  pipeline  is  designed  to  carry  approximately  500,000  barrels  per  day 
of  crude  oil  from  the  Bakken  and  Three  Forks  oil  production  areas  in 
North  Dakota  to  oil  markets  in  the  United  States.  At  this  time,  the  DAPL 
is  more  than  90%  complete  across  its  entire  route.  Only  a  limited  portion 
remains to be constructed. 
I  believe  that  construction  and  operation  of  lawfully  permitted  pipeline 
infrastructure serve the national interest. 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the 
Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct 
as follows: 
Sec.  2.  Directives.  (a)  Pipeline  Approval  Review.  The  Secretary  of  the  Army 
shall  instruct  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  for  Civil  Works  and 
the  U.S.  Army  Corps  of  Engineers  (USACE),  including  the  Commanding 
General and Chief of Engineers, to take all actions necessary and appropriate 
to: 

(i)  review  and  approve  in  an  expedited  manner,  to  the  extent  permitted 
by  law  and  as  warranted,  and  with  such  conditions  as  are  necessary 
or  appropriate,  requests  for  approvals  to  construct  and  operate  the  DAPL, 
including  easements  or  rights-of-way  to  cross  Federal  areas  under  section 
28  of  the  Mineral  Leasing  Act,  as  amended,  30  U.S.C.  185;  permits  or 
approvals  under  section  404  of  the  Clean  Water  Act,  33  U.S.C.  1344; 
permits  or  approvals  under  section  14  of  the  Rivers  and  Harbors  Act, 
33  U.S.C.  408;  and  such  other  Federal  approvals  as  may  be  necessary; 
(ii)  consider,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted,  whether 
to  rescind  or  modify  the  memorandum  by  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the 
Army  for  Civil  Works  dated  December  4,  2016  (Proposed  Dakota  Access 
Pipeline  Crossing  at  Lake  Oahe,  North  Dakota),  and  whether  to  withdraw 
the  Notice  of  Intent  to  Prepare  an  Environmental  Impact  Statement  in 
Connection  with  Dakota  Access,  LLC’s  Request  for  an  Easement  to  Cross 
Lake  Oahe,  North  Dakota,  dated  January  18,  2017,  and  published  at  82 
Fed. Reg. 5543; 
(iii)  consider,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted,  prior 
reviews  and  determinations,  including  the  Environmental  Assessment 
issued  in  July  of  2016  for  the  DAPL,  as  satisfying  all  applicable  require-
ments  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy  Act,  as  amended,  42  U.S.C. 
4321 et seq., and any other provision of law that requires executive agency 
consultation or review (including the consultation or review required under 
section  7(a)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973,  16  U.S.C.  1536(a)); 
(iv)  review  and  grant,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted, 
requests  for  waivers  of  notice  periods  arising  from  or  related  to  USACE 
real estate policies and regulations; and 
(v)  issue,  to  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  as  warranted,  any  approved 
easements or rights-of-way immediately after notice is provided to Congress

Executive  Order  13769  of  January  27,  2017 

Protecting  the  Nation  From  Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  Into  the 
United  States 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  laws 
of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  the  Immigration  and  Nationality 
Act  (INA),  8  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.,  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States 
Code,  and  to  protect  the  American  people  from  terrorist  attacks  by  foreign 
nationals  admitted  to  the  United  States,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting 
individuals  with  terrorist  ties  and  stopping  them  from  entering  the  United 
States.  Perhaps  in  no  instance  was  that  more  apparent  than  the  terrorist 
attacks  of  September  11,  2001,  when  State  Department  policy  prevented 
consular  officers  from  properly  scrutinizing  the  visa  applications  of  several 
of  the  19  foreign  nationals  who  went  on  to  murder  nearly  3,000  Americans. 
And  while  the  visa-issuance  process  was  reviewed  and  amended  after  the 
September  11  attacks  to  better  detect  would-be  terrorists  from  receiving 
visas,  these  measures  did  not  stop  attacks  by  foreign  nationals  who  were 
admitted to the United States. 
Numerous  foreign-born  individuals  have  been  convicted  or  implicated  in 
terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nation-
als who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employ-
ment  visas,  or  who  entered  through  the  United  States  refugee  resettlement 
program.  Deteriorating  conditions  in  certain  countries  due  to  war,  strife, 
disaster,  and  civil  unrest  increase  the  likelihood  that  terrorists  will  use 
any  means  possible  to  enter  the  United  States.  The  United  States  must 
be  vigilant  during  the  visa-issuance  process  to  ensure  that  those  approved 
for  admission  do  not  intend  to  harm  Americans  and  that  they  have  no 
ties to terrorism. 
In  order  to  protect  Americans,  the  United  States  must  ensure  that  those 
admitted  to  this  country  do  not  bear  hostile  attitudes  toward  it  and  its 
founding  principles.  The  United  States  cannot,  and  should  not,  admit  those 
who  do  not  support  the  Constitution,  or  those  who  would  place  violent 
ideologies  over  American  law.  In  addition,  the  United  States  should  not 
admit  those  who  engage  in  acts  of  bigotry  or  hatred  (including  ‘‘honor’’ 
killings,  other  forms  of  violence  against  women,  or  the  persecution  of  those 
who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress 
Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. 
Sec.  2.  Policy.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  protect  its  citizens 
from  foreign  nationals  who  intend  to  commit  terrorist  attacks  in  the  United 
States;  and  to  prevent  the  admission  of  foreign  nationals  who  intend  to 
exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes. 
Sec.  3.  Suspension  of  Issuance  of  Visas  and  Other  Immigration  Benefits 
to  Nationals  of  Countries  of  Particular  Concern.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  Home-
land  Security,  in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Director 
of  National  Intelligence,  shall  immediately  conduct  a  review  to  determine 
the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, 
or  other  benefit  under  the  INA  (adjudications)  in  order  to  determine  that 
the  individual  seeking  the  benefit  is  who  the  individual  claims  to  be  and 
is not a security or public-safety threat. 

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary 
of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President

a  report  on  the  results  of  the  review  described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this 
section,  including  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security’s  determination  of 
the  information  needed  for  adjudications  and  a  list  of  countries  that  do 
not  provide  adequate  information,  within  30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order. 
The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  provide  a  copy  of  the  report 
to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. 

(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during 
the  review  period  described  in  subsection  (a)  of  this  section,  to  ensure 
the  proper  review  and  maximum  utilization  of  available  resources  for  the 
screening  of  foreign  nationals,  and  to  ensure  that  adequate  standards  are 
established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant 
to  section  212(f)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1182(f),  I  hereby  proclaim  that  the 
immigrant  and  nonimmigrant  entry  into  the  United  States  of  aliens  from 
countries  referred  to  in  section  217(a)(12)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1187(a)(12), 
would  be  detrimental  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States,  and  I  hereby 
suspend  entry  into  the  United  States,  as  immigrants  and  nonimmigrants, 
of  such  persons  for  90  days  from  the  date  of  this  order  (excluding  those 
foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation  visas,  C–2  visas  for  travel  to  the  United  Nations,  and  G–1,  G–2, 
G–3, and G–4 visas). 

(d)  Immediately  upon  receipt  of  the  report  described  in  subsection  (b) 
of  this  section  regarding  the  information  needed  for  adjudications,  the  Sec-
retary  of  State  shall  request  all  foreign  governments  that  do  not  supply 
such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals 
within 60 days of notification. 

(e)  After  the  60-day  period  described  in  subsection  (d)  of  this  section 
expires,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation  with  the  Sec-
retary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended 
for  inclusion  on  a  Presidential  proclamation  that  would  prohibit  the  entry 
of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic 
visas,  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  visas,  C–2  visas  for  travel  to  the 
United  Nations,  and  G–1,  G–2,  G–3,  and  G–4  visas)  from  countries  that 
do  not  provide  the  information  requested  pursuant  to  subsection  (d)  of 
this section until compliance occurs. 

(f)  At  any  point  after  submitting  the  list  described  in  subsection  (e)  of 
this  section,  the  Secretary  of  State  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security 
may  submit  to  the  President  the  names  of  any  additional  countries  rec-
ommended for similar treatment. 

(g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section 
or  pursuant  to  a  Presidential  proclamation  described  in  subsection  (e)  of 
this  section,  the  Secretaries  of  State  and  Homeland  Security  may,  on  a 
case-by-case  basis,  and  when  in  the  national  interest,  issue  visas  or  other 
immigration  benefits  to  nationals  of  countries  for  which  visas  and  benefits 
are otherwise blocked. 

(h)  The  Secretaries  of  State  and  Homeland  Security  shall  submit  to  the 
President  a  joint  report  on  the  progress  in  implementing  this  order  within 
30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  a  second  report  within  60  days  of  the 
date  of  this  order,  a  third  report  within  90  days  of  the  date  of  this  order, 
and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order. 
Sec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Pro-
grams.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  the 
Director  of  National  Intelligence,  and  the  Director  of  the  Federal  Bureau 
of  Investigation  shall  implement  a  program,  as  part  of  the  adjudication 
process  for  immigration  benefits,  to  identify  individuals  seeking  to  enter 
the  United  States  on  a  fraudulent  basis  with  the  intent  to  cause  harm, 
or  who  are  at  risk  of  causing  harm  subsequent  to  their  admission.  This 
program  will  include  the  development  of  a  uniform  screening  standard 
and  procedure,  such  as  in-person  interviews;  a  database  of  identity  docu-
ments  proffered  by  applicants  to  ensure  that  duplicate  documents  are  not

used  by  multiple  applicants;  amended  application  forms  that  include  ques-
tions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mecha-
nism  to  ensure  that  the  applicant  is  who  the  applicant  claims  to  be;  a 
process  to  evaluate  the  applicant’s  likelihood  of  becoming  a  positively  con-
tributing member of society and the applicant’s ability to make contributions 
to  the  national  interest;  and  a  mechanism  to  assess  whether  or  not  the 
applicant  has  the  intent  to  commit  criminal  or  terrorist  acts  after  entering 
the United States. 

(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary 
of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal 
Bureau  of  Investigation,  shall  submit  to  the  President  an  initial  report  on 
the  progress  of  this  directive  within  60  days  of  the  date  of  this  order, 
a  second  report  within  100  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  and  a  third 
report within 200 days of the date of this order. 
Sec.  5.  Realignment  of  the  U.S.  Refugee  Admissions  Program  for  Fiscal 
Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admis-
sions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary 
of  State,  in  conjunction  with  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and  in 
consultation  with  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  shall  review  the 
USRAP  application  and  adjudication  process  to  determine  what  additional 
procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admis-
sion  do  not  pose  a  threat  to  the  security  and  welfare  of  the  United  States, 
and  shall  implement  such  additional  procedures.  Refugee  applicants  who 
are  already  in  the  USRAP  process  may  be  admitted  upon  the  initiation 
and  completion  of  these  revised  procedures.  Upon  the  date  that  is  120 
days  after  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  resume  USRAP 
admissions  only  for  nationals  of  countries  for  which  the  Secretary  of  State, 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence 
have  jointly  determined  that  such  additional  procedures  are  adequate  to 
ensure the security and welfare of the United States. 

(b)  Upon  the  resumption  of  USRAP  admissions,  the  Secretary  of  State, 
in  consultation  with  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  is  further  directed 
to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims 
made  by  individuals  on  the  basis  of  religious-based  persecution,  provided 
that  the  religion  of  the  individual  is  a  minority  religion  in  the  individual’s 
country  of  nationality.  Where  necessary  and  appropriate,  the  Secretaries 
of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President 
that would assist with such prioritization. 

(c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim 
that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests 
of  the  United  States  and  thus  suspend  any  such  entry  until  such  time 
as  I  have  determined  that  sufficient  changes  have  been  made  to  the  USRAP 
to  ensure  that  admission  of  Syrian  refugees  is  consistent  with  the  national 
interest. 

(d)  Pursuant  to  section  212(f)  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1182(f),  I  hereby 
proclaim  that  the  entry  of  more  than  50,000  refugees  in  fiscal  year  2017 
would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend 
any  such  entry  until  such  time  as  I  determine  that  additional  admissions 
would be in the national interest. 

(e)  Notwithstanding  the  temporary  suspension  imposed  pursuant  to  sub-
section  (a)  of  this  section,  the  Secretaries  of  State  and  Homeland  Security 
may  jointly  determine  to  admit  individuals  to  the  United  States  as  refugees 
on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine 
that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest— 
including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality 
facing  religious  persecution,  when  admitting  the  person  would  enable  the 
United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, 
or  when  the  person  is  already  in  transit  and  denying  admission  would 
cause  undue  hardship—and  it  would  not  pose  a  risk  to  the  security  or 
welfare of the United States.

(f)  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  submit  to  the  President  an  initial  report 
on  the  progress  of  the  directive  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  section  regarding 
prioritization  of  claims  made  by  individuals  on  the  basis  of  religious-based 
persecution  within  100  days  of  the  date  of  this  order  and  shall  submit 
a second report within 200 days of the date of this order. 

(g)  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  that,  to  the  extent  permitted 
by  law  and  as  practicable,  State  and  local  jurisdictions  be  granted  a  role 
in  the  process  of  determining  the  placement  or  settlement  in  their  jurisdic-
tions  of  aliens  eligible  to  be  admitted  to  the  United  States  as  refugees. 
To  that  end,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  examine  existing 
law  to  determine  the  extent  to  which,  consistent  with  applicable  law,  State 
and  local  jurisdictions  may  have  greater  involvement  in  the  process  of 
determining  the  placement  or  resettlement  of  refugees  in  their  jurisdictions, 
and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement. 
Sec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds 
of  Inadmissibility.  The  Secretaries  of  State  and  Homeland  Security  shall, 
in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises 
of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism 
grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda. 
Sec.  7.  Expedited  Completion  of  the  Biometric  Entry-Exit  Tracking  System. 
(a)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  expedite  the  completion  and 
implementation  of  a  biometric  entry-exit  tracking  system  for  all  travelers 
to  the  United  States,  as  recommended  by  the  National  Commission  on  Ter-
rorist Attacks Upon the United States. 

(b)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  submit  to  the  President 
periodic  reports  on  the  progress  of  the  directive  contained  in  subsection 
(a)  of  this  section.  The  initial  report  shall  be  submitted  within  100  days 
of  the  date  of  this  order,  a  second  report  shall  be  submitted  within  200 
days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  and  a  third  report  shall  be  submitted  within 
365  days  of  the  date  of  this  order.  Further,  the  Secretary  shall  submit 
a  report  every  180  days  thereafter  until  the  system  is  fully  deployed  and 
operational. 
Sec.  8.  Visa  Interview  Security.  (a)  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  immediately 
suspend  the  Visa  Interview  Waiver  Program  and  ensure  compliance  with 
section  222  of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1202,  which  requires  that  all  individuals 
seeking  a  nonimmigrant  visa  undergo  an  in-person  interview,  subject  to 
specific statutory exceptions. 

(b)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  subject  to  the  availability  of 
appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular 
Fellows  Program,  including  by  substantially  increasing  the  number  of  Fel-
lows,  lengthening  or  making  permanent  the  period  of  service,  and  making 
language  training  at  the  Foreign  Service  Institute  available  to  Fellows  for 
assignment  to  posts  outside  of  their  area  of  core  linguistic  ability,  to  ensure 
that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected. 
Sec.  9.  Visa  Validity  Reciprocity.  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  review  all 
nonimmigrant  visa  reciprocity  agreements  to  ensure  that  they  are,  with  re-
spect  to  each  visa  classification,  truly  reciprocal  insofar  as  practicable  with 
respect  to  validity  period  and  fees,  as  required  by  sections  221(c)  and  281 
of  the  INA,  8  U.S.C.  1201(c)  and  1351,  and  other  treatment.  If  a  country 
does  not  treat  United  States  nationals  seeking  nonimmigrant  visas  in  a 
reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, 
fee  schedule,  or  other  treatment  to  match  the  treatment  of  United  States 
nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable. 
Sec.  10.  Transparency  and  Data  Collection.  (a)  To  be  more  transparent 
with  the  American  people,  and  to  more  effectively  implement  policies  and 
practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
in  consultation  with  the  Attorney  General,  shall,  consistent  with  applicable 
law  and  national  security,  collect  and  make  publicly  available  within  180 
days, and every 180 days thereafter:

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9631  of  August  25,  2017 

Women’s  Equality  Day,  2017 

41317 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  August  26,  1920,  America  ratified  the  19th  Amendment,  securing  for 
women  a  sacred  right  of  citizenship:  the  right  to  vote.  On  the  anniversary 
of that historic day, we celebrate Women’s Equality Day and the innumerable 
contributions  women  have  made  to  their  families,  their  communities,  and 
in service to our country. 
Women’s  suffrage  in  America  has  its  roots  in  the  meeting  of  a  group  of 
trailblazers in 1848, in Seneca Falls, New York. While that meeting sparked 
a  movement,  suffragists  fought  for  72  long  years  thereafter  to  secure  the 
vote for women nationwide. Women have always been instrumental to Amer-
ica’s  greatness,  but  with  greater  access  to  governing  institutions  through 
national  suffrage,  generations  of  women  have  been  able  to  use  the  power 
of  the  ballot  to  shape  their  communities  and  help  keep  America  a  beacon 
of freedom and opportunity for the world. 
My  Administration  will  continue  to  support  the  advancement  of  women, 
in  every  corner  of  the  Nation.  One  of  my  first  actions  as  President  was 
to  establish  the  United  States-Canada  Council  for  Advancement  of  Women 
Entrepreneurs  and  Business  Leaders.  Recently,  I  pledged  $50  million  to 
the  new  World  Bank  Group  Women  Entrepreneurs  Finance  Initiative.  By 
expanding  access  to  capital  and  networks,  this  important  initiative  will 
address  many  of  the  unique  challenges  women  entrepreneurs  in  the  devel-
oping  world  face  when  financing  and  growing  their  businesses.  Through 
these efforts and others, we will support bold and innovative women leaders 
and  entrepreneurs  domestically  and  abroad,  recognizing  that  their  successes 
make our economy, and our Nation, stronger. 
My  Administration  is  committed  to  fostering  an  economy  where  all  women 
can  succeed  and  thrive.  We  must  prioritize  the  needs  of  working  mothers 
and  families,  including  access  to  affordable  childcare.  Therefore,  for  the 
first  time  in  the  history  of  this  country,  my  budget  proposes  a  national 
paid  family  leave  program.  Our  working  families  must  be  able  to  provide 
and care for their children without fear of financial insolvency, to strengthen 
our communities and drive a booming economy. 
As  President,  I  am  also  working  to  ensure  that  all  women  have  access 
to  the  training  they  need  to  succeed  in  our  modern  economy,  especially 
in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  (STEM)  fields.  Women  make 
up  only  12  percent  of  engineers,  and  the  percentage  of  women  in  computer 
and  mathematical  occupations  has  decreased  over  the  past  three  decades. 
To empower women to participate in all sectors of our economy, my Adminis-
tration  is  committed  to  workforce  development,  particularly  through  the 
expansion of apprenticeships and vocational education. We must break down 
the biases and barriers women in STEM face, and encourage every American 
to pursue excellence in his or her chosen field. 
As we observe Women’s Equality Day, commemorating the 19th Amendment, 
we  honor  America’s  female  pioneers.  These  resilient  women  have  inspired 
countless others to challenge the status quo in order to advance the ultimate 
American  value:  that  all  men  and  women  are  created  equal.  Together,  we

in  herself,  her  future,  and  following  her  heart  toward  the  American  Dream. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  August  26,  2017, 
as  Women’s  Equality  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States 
to  celebrate  the  achievements  of  women  and  observe  this  day  with  appro-
priate programs and activities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-fifth 
day  of  August,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and

Proclamation  9559  of  December  28,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Gold  Butte  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  southeast  Nevada  lies  a  landscape  of  contrast  and  transition,  where  dra-
matically chiseled red sandstone, twisting canyons, and tree-clad mountains 
punctuate flat stretches of the Mojave Desert. This remote and rugged desert 
landscape is known as Gold Butte. 
The  Gold  Butte  area  contains  an  extraordinary  variety  of  diverse  and  irre-
placeable  scientific,  historic,  and  prehistoric  resources,  including  vital  plant 
and wildlife habitat, significant geological formations, rare fossils, important 
sites  from  the  history  of  Native  Americans,  and  remnants  of  our  Western 
mining  and  ranching  heritage.  The  landscape  reveals  a  story  of  thousands 
of  years  of  human  interaction  with  this  harsh  environment  and  provides 
a  rare  glimpse  into  the  lives  of  Nevada’s  first  inhabitants,  the  rich  and 
varied  indigenous  cultures  that  followed,  and  the  eventual  arrival  of  Euro- 
American  settlers.  Canyons  and  intricate  rock  formations  are  a  stunning 
backdrop  to  the  area’s  famously  beautiful  rock  art,  and  the  desert  provides 
critical habitat for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise. 
Gold Butte’s dynamic environment has provided food and shelter to humans 
for  at  least  12,000  years.  Remnants  of  massive  agave  roasting  pits,  charred 
remains  of  goosefoot  and  pinyon  pine  nuts,  bone  fragments,  and  projectile 
points  used  to  hunt  big  horn  sheep  and  smaller  game  serve  as  evidence 
of the remarkable abilities of indigenous communities to eke out sustenance 
from  this  unforgiving  landscape.  Visitors  to  Gold  Butte  can  still  see  ancient 
rock  shelters  and  hearth  remnants  concealed  in  the  area’s  dramatic  Aztec 
Sandstone  formations.  This  brightly  hued  sandstone  is  the  canvas  for  the 
area’s  spectacular  array  of  rock  art,  depicting  human  figures,  animals,  and 
swirling abstract designs at locations like the famed Falling Man petroglyph 
site and Kohta Circus. Pottery sherds and other archaeological artifacts scat-
tered  throughout  the  landscape  reveal  the  area’s  role  as  a  corridor  for  the 
interregional trade of pottery, salt, and rare minerals. These world-renowned 
archaeological  sites  and  objects  are  helping  scientists  to  better  understand 
interactions between ancient cultural groups. 
By  the  time  Spanish  explorers  arrived  in  the  region  in  the  late  eighteenth 
century,  the  Gold  Butte  area  was  home  to  the  Southern  Paiute  people, 
who  to  this  day,  retain  a  spiritual  and  cultural  connection  with  the  land 
and use it for traditional purposes such as ceremonies and plant harvesting. 
Hunters  and  settlers  of  European  descent  followed  the  explorers,  and,  by 
1865, Mormon pioneers had built settlements in the region. 
These newcomers grazed livestock and explored Gold Butte’s unique geology 
in  pursuit  of  mining  riches.  Their  activities  left  behind  historic  sites  and 
objects  that  tell  the  story  of  the  American  West,  including  the  Gold  Butte 
townsite,  a  mining  boomtown  established  in  the  early  1900s,  but  mostly 
abandoned  by  1910.  Several  building  foundations  and  arrastas—large  flat 
rocks  used  for  crushing  ore—remain  at  the  townsite  today.  Settlers  built 
corrals  out  of  wood  or  stone,  some  of  which  are  still  standing  in  the  Gold

of historic features including a dam and remnants of a camp in the Whitney 
Pockets area, in the northeastern region of Gold Butte. 
The  Gold  Butte  landscape  that  visitors  experience  today  is  the  product 
of  millions  of  years  of  heat  and  pressure  as  well  as  the  eroding  forces 
of  water  and  wind  that  molded  this  vast  and  surreal  desert  terrain.  Rising 
up  from  the  Virgin  River  to  an  elevation  of  almost  8,000  feet,  the  Virgin 
Mountains  delineate  the  area’s  northeast  corner  and  provide  a  stunning 
backdrop for the rugged gray and red desert of the lower elevations. Faulted 
carbonate  and  silicate  rock  form  the  ridges  and  peaks  of  this  range,  which 
are  regularly  snow-covered  in  winter  and  spring,  while  the  southern  region 
of  Gold  Butte  is  laced  with  a  series  of  wide  granitic  ridges  and  narrow 
canyons. These broad landscape features are dotted with fantastical geologic 
formations,  including  vividly  hued  Aztec  Sandstone  twisted  into  other-
worldly shapes by wind and water, as well as pale, desolate granitic domes. 
An  actively-expanding  1,200  square-meter  sinkhole  known  as  the  Devil’s 
Throat has been the subject of multiple scientific studies that have enhanced 
our understanding of sinkhole formation. 
The  Gold  Butte  landscape  is  a  mosaic  of  braided  and  shallow  washes  that 
flow  into  the  Virgin  River  to  the  north  and  directly  into  Lake  Mead  on 
the south and west. Several natural springs provide important water sources 
for  the  plants  and  animals  living  here.  The  arid  eastern  Mojave  Desert 
landscape  that  dominates  the  area  is  characterized  by  the  creosote  bush 
and  white  bursage  vegetative  community  that  covers  large,  open  expanses 
scattered  with  low  shrubs.  Blackbrush  scrub,  a  slow-growing  species  that 
can  live  up  to  400  years,  is  abundant  in  middle  elevations.  Both  creosote- 
bursage  and  blackbrush  scrub  vegetation  communities  can  take  decades  or 
even  centuries  to  recover  from  disturbances  due  to  the  long-lived  nature 
of  the  plant  species  in  these  vegetative  communities  and  the  area’s  low 
rainfall. These vegetation communities are impacted by human uses, invasive 
species,  wildfires,  and  changing  climates.  Gypsum  deposits  are  a  distinctive 
aspect  of  the  Mojave  Desert  ecosystem  and  result  in  soil  that  contains 
physical  and  chemical  properties  that  stress  many  plants,  but  also  support 
endemic  and  rare  species.  For  example,  the  sticky  ringstem,  Las  Vegas 
buckwheat, and Las Vegas bearpoppy are unique plants that rely on gypsum 
soil;  the  populations  in  Gold  Butte  are  some  of  only  a  handful  of  isolated 
populations  of  these  species  left  in  the  world.  Other  rare  plants  in  Gold 
Butte  include  the  threecorner  milkvetch  and  sticky  wild  buckwheat,  which 
are  sand-dependent  species,  as  well  as  the  Rosy  two-tone  beardtongue  and 
the  Mokiak  milkvetch.  Scattered  stands  of  Joshua  trees,  an  emblem  of  the 
Mojave  Desert,  dot  the  landscape  along  with  Mojave  yucca,  cacti  species, 
and chaparral species, among others. 
The  often  snowcapped  peaks  of  the  Virgin  Mountains  in  the  northeastern 
corner of Gold Butte stand in stark contrast to the desolate desert landscapes 
found  elsewhere  in  the  area.  Due  to  their  elevation  of  almost  8,000  feet, 
these  mountains  exhibit  a  transition  between  ecosystems  in  the  southwest. 
At  the  highest  points  of  the  Virgin  Mountains,  visitors  can  hike  through 
Ponderosa  pine  and  white  fir  forests,  and  visit  the  southernmost  stand 
of  Douglas  fir  in  Nevada.  In  this  area,  visitors  are  also  treated  to  a  rare 
sight:  the  Silver  State’s  only  stand  of  the  Arizona  cypress.  The  lower  to 
middle  elevations  of  the  area  are  home  to  stands  of  pinyon  pine,  Utah 
juniper,  sagebrush,  and  acacia  woodlands,  along  with  occasional  mesquite 
stands.  By  adding  structural  complexity  to  a  shrub-dominated  landscape, 
these  woodlands  provide  important  breeding,  foraging,  and  resting  places 
for a variety of creatures, including birds and insects, and support a number 
of plant species. 
Gold  Butte  also  provides  habitat  for  a  number  of  wildlife  species.  It  has 
been  designated  as  critical  habitat  for  the  Mojave  desert  tortoise,  which 
is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. These slow-footed 
symbols  of  the  American  Southwest  rely  on  the  creosote-bursage  ecosystem 
that  is  widespread  here.  A  generally  reclusive  reptile,  the  Mojave  desert

tortoise uses the protective cover of underground burrows to escape extreme 
desert conditions and as shelter from predators. 
Other  amphibians  and  reptiles  also  make  their  homes  in  Gold  Butte.  For 
example,  once  considered  extinct  and  now  a  candidate  species  for  listing 
under  the  Endangered  Species  Act,  the  relict  leopard  frog  has  been  released 
into  spring  sites  in  the  area  in  a  collaborative  effort  by  local,  State,  and 
Federal  entities  to  help  revive  this  still  very  small  population.  The  banded 
Gila  monster,  the  only  venomous  lizard  in  the  United  States,  has  also  been 
recorded  in  Gold  Butte.  Many  other  reptile  species—including  the  banded 
gecko,  California  kingsnake,  desert  iguana,  desert  night  lizard,  glossy  snake, 
Great  Basin  collared  lizard,  Mojave  green  rattlesnake,  sidewinder,  Sonoran 
lyre snake, southern desert horned lizard, speckled rattlesnake, western leaf- 
nosed  snake,  western  long-nosed  snake,  and  western  red-tailed  skink—also 
have populations or potential habitats in the area. 
The  Gold  Butte  area  serves  as  an  effective  corridor  between  Lake  Mead 
and the Virgin Mountains for large mammals, including desert bighorn sheep 
and  mountain  lions.  Smaller  mammals  in  Gold  Butte  include  white-tailed 
antelope  squirrel,  desert  kangaroo  rat,  and  the  desert  pocket  mouse.  Several 
species  of  bat,  including  the  Pallid  bat,  Allen’s  big-eared  bat,  western 
pipistrelle  bat,  and  the  Brazilian  free-tailed  bat,  are  also  found  here,  as 
well as the northern Mojave blue butterfly. 
Bald  and  golden  eagles,  red-tailed  and  Cooper’s  hawks,  peregrine  falcons, 
and  white-throated  swifts  soar  above  Gold  Butte.  Closer  to  the  ground, 
one can spot a variety of birds, including the western burrowing owl, common 
poorwill,  Costa’s  hummingbird,  pinyon  jay,  Bendire’s  thrasher,  Virginia’s 
warbler,  Lucy’s  warbler,  black-chinned  sparrow,  and  gray  vireo.  Migratory 
birds,  including  the  Calliope  hummingbird,  gray  flycatcher,  sage  sparrow, 
lesser  nighthawk,  ash-throated  flycatcher,  and  the  Brewer’s  sparrow,  also 
make  stop-overs  in  the  area.  These  birds,  and  a  variety  of  other  avian 
species,  use  the  diversity  of  habitats  in  the  area  to  meet  many  of  their 
seasonal, migratory, or year-round life cycle needs. 
In  addition  to  providing  homes  to  modern  species  of  plants  and  wildlife, 
the  area  shows  great  potential  for  continued  paleontological  research,  with 
resources  such  as  recently  discovered  dinosaur  tracks  dating  back  to  the 
Jurassic Period. These fossil trackways were found in Gold Butte’s distinctive 
Aztec  Sandstone  and  also  include  prints  from  squirrel-sized  reptilian  ances-
tors of mammals. 
The  protection  of  the  Gold  Butte  area  will  preserve  its  cultural,  prehistoric, 
and  historic  legacy  and  maintain  its  diverse  array  of  natural  and  scientific 
resources,  ensuring  that  the  historic  and  scientific  values  of  this  area,  and 
its  many  objects  of  historic  and  of  scientific  interest,  remain  for  the  benefit 
of all Americans. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  in  all  cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  objects  of  scientific 
and historic interest on the Gold Butte lands; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Gold  Butte  National  Monument  (monument) 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  part  thereof

Determination  No.  2017–08  of  June  13,  2017 

Presidential  Determination  Pursuant  to  Section  4533(a)(5)  of 
the  Defense  Production  Act  of  1950 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  Defense 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States, including section 4533(a)(5) of the Defense Produc-
tion  Act  of  1950  (the  ‘‘Act’’)  (50  U.S.C.  4533(a)(5)),  I  hereby  determine, 
pursuant  to  section  4533(a)(5)  of  the  Act,  that  critical  technology  items 
affecting aerospace structures and fibers, radiation-hardened microelectronics, 
radiation test and qualification facilities, and satellite components and assem-
blies are critical to national defense. 
Without Presidential action under this Act, the United States space industrial 
base  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to  adequately  provide  those  critical 
technology  items  in  a  timely  manner.  Further,  purchases,  purchase  commit-
ments,  or  other  action  pursuant  to  section  4533  of  the  Act  are  the  most 
cost  effective,  expedient,  and  practical  alternative  method  for  meeting  the 
needs for those critical technology items. 
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal 
Register.

Proclamation  9563  of  January  12,  2017 

Boundary  Enlargement  of  the  California  Coastal  National 
Monument 

By  The  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Through Proclamation 7264 of January 11, 2000, President Clinton established 
the California Coastal National Monument (monument) to protect the biologi-
cal treasures situated on thousands of unappropriated or unreserved islands, 
rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles owned or controlled by the Government 
of  the  United  States  within  12  nautical  miles  of  the  shoreline  of  the  State 
of  California.  Presidential  Proclamation  9089,  issued  on  March  11,  2014, 
expanded the monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands, 
a  landscape  of  coastal  bluffs  and  shelves,  tide  pools,  onshore  dunes,  coastal 
prairies,  and  riverbanks,  and  the  mouth  and  estuary  of  the  Garcia  River. 
In  addition  to  providing  vital  habitat  for  wildlife,  these  coastal  lands  were 
critical  for  the  native  peoples  who  first  lived  along  the  California  Coast, 
and they continue to be treasured by modern generations. 
Six  other  spectacular  areas  along  the  California  Coast  contain  significant 
scientific  or  historic  resources  that  are  closely  tied  to  the  values  of  the 
monument.  Like  the  protections  afforded  by  prior  proclamations,  protection 
of Trinidad Head, Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, Lost Coast Headlands, Cotoni- 
Coast Dairies, Piedras Blancas, and Orange County Rocks and Islands would 
protect and preserve objects of historic or scientific interest on the California 
Coast. 
Trinidad Head 
About  30  miles  north  of  Eureka  lies  the  majestic  and  culturally  important 
promontory known as Trinidad Head. The tip of Trinidad Head encompasses 
several  prominent  historic  sites  along  with  the  rocky  ledges  that  provide 
their  setting,  such  as  the  Trinidad  Head  Light  Station,  which  first  operated 
in  1871  and  is  still  active  today.  Accompanied  by  a  small  wooden  bell 
house,  it  sits  atop  sheer  cliffs  overlooking  crashing  waves  and  rugged  sea 
stacks. The importance of this location predated its first use as a lighthouse. 
Nearly  100  years  earlier,  on  June  9,  1775,  representatives  of  the  local  Yurok 
community  first  made  contact  with  two  Spanish  ships  there.  A  granite 
cross installed in 1913 sits in a clearing above the lighthouse, commemorating 
the  spot  where  the  Spanish  erected  a  wooden  cross  two  days  later  to  claim 
the  area  for  King  Charles  III.  Today,  the  area  is  culturally  and  spiritually 
significant  to  the  Cher-Ae  Heights  Indian  Community  of  the  Trinidad 
Rancheria, the Yurok Tribe, and the Tsurai Ancestral Society. 
Coastal bluff scrub vegetation, including coyote brush, California wax myrtle, 
salal, blue blossom, ocean spray, and evergreen huckleberry, surrounds these 
historic features. Scattered stands of Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, and red alder 
stand  out  among  these  native  shrubs  and  herbs.  Coast  Indian  paintbrush 
grows in rocky outcroppings near the bell house, adding splashes of crimson 
to  the  landscape.  Visitors  to  Trinidad  Head  enjoy  observing  the  Trinidad 
seabird  colony,  which  makes  its  home  on  the  rocks  and  islands  off  the 
coast  of  Trinidad  Head  and  contains  over  75,000  birds,  including  several 
species  of  cormorant,  the  common  murre,  and  occasionally  tufted  puffins.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  11 / Wednesday,  January  18,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

Perched  on  the  edge  of  Table  Bluff,  12  miles  south  of  Eureka,  Waluplh- 
Lighthouse  Ranch  has  spectacular  panoramic  views  of  the  Pacific  Ocean, 
Eel  River  Delta,  and  the  south  spit  of  Humboldt  Bay.  In  addition  to  out-
standing  scenery,  visitors  to  Waluplh-Lighthouse  Ranch  can  view  migratory 
raptors, songbirds, and the endangered marbled murrelet. 
Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch is part of the ancestral home and current cultural 
traditions  of  the  Wiyot  Tribe,  who  gave  it  the  name  Waluplh.  With  its 
expansive  views,  the  area  served  as  a  lookout  point  for  the  Tribe,  as  well 
as  a  crossroads  for  trails  connecting  inland  areas  with  Humboldt  Bay  to 
the  north  and  the  bottomlands  surrounding  the  mouth  of  the  Eel  River 
to  the  south.  Beginning  in  the  late  1800s,  Waluplh-Lighthouse  Ranch  was 
developed  as  a  Coast  Guard  facility,  and  during  World  War  II,  it  served 
as  a  coastal  lookout  post  and  the  base  for  a  mounted  beach  patrol.  There 
are  no  longer  any  buildings  on  the  property,  so  visitors  now  enjoy  its 
panoramic views surrounded by open space. 
Lost Coast Headlands 
Thirteen miles south of Waluplh-Lighthouse Ranch, the Lost Coast Headlands 
present  a  majestic  coastline,  encompassing  rolling  hills  and  dramatically 
eroding bluffs, punctuated by freshwater creeks, ponds, and pockets of forests. 
Underlying  the  Lost  Coast  Headlands  are  layers  of  highly  erodible  sedi-
mentary  rock  known  as  the  Wildcat  Group.  This  geology  has  weathered 
over  the  years,  leading  to  deeply  carved  and  incised  bluffs  along  the  beach 
made  up  of  multi-hued  layers  of  gray  clay,  golden  sandstone,  and  brown 
siltstone.  The  eroding  of  the  bluffs  over  time  exposes  fossils  of  scallops, 
clams,  and  snails,  providing  a  glimpse  of  the  marine  fauna  that  lived  in 
the  area  during  the  Pleistocene  Epoch  2.6  million  to  11,700  years  ago. 
Coastal scrub vegetation and open grasslands blanket the area’s rolling hills. 
Coyote  brush  and  California  blackberry  dominate,  and  in  the  grasslands, 
small patches of native Pacific reed grass meadow remain. Pockets of Douglas 
fir,  Sitka  spruce,  and  grand  fir  shadow  the  eroded  draws.  These  diverse 
habitats  support  an  array  of  wildlife  species,  including  black-tailed  deer, 
bobcat,  brush  rabbit,  and  Douglas  squirrel.  While  more  elusive,  gray  fox, 
coyote, and mountain lion also pass through the area, and a careful observer 
may  notice  signs  of  their  presence.  A  variety  of  small  birds  dart  about 
its  grasslands  and  scrub,  while  raptors  such  as  American  kestrels,  northern 
harriers,  peregrine  falcons,  and  Cooper’s  hawks  scan  for  prey  overhead. 
Quiet  visitors  may  hear  hairy  woodpeckers  in  the  forested  draws.  Foraging 
shorebirds and gulls, along with the occasional harbor seal, can be observed 
on the narrow beaches. 
Buffered  by  red  alder  and  willow,  Guthrie  and  Fleener  creeks  wind  their 
way through the Lost Coast Headlands on their way to the sea. Both perennial 
streams  provide  habitat  for  three-spined  stickleback,  a  small  native  fish. 
Sculpin,  Pacific  lamprey,  and  the  threatened  Northern  California  steelhead 
have  also  been  observed  in  Guthrie  Creek,  and  both  creeks  are  potential 
habitat  for  the  threatened  coho  salmon.  During  the  summer,  the  mouth 
of  Guthrie  Creek  widens  into  a  lagoon  that  can  provide  shelter  for  estuary- 
dependent  fish  and  invertebrates.  The  area  also  features  three  small,  fresh-
water  ponds  that  provide  habitat  for  the  threatened  California  red-legged 
frog and a variety of waterfowl, including green-winged teals. 
While  few  signs  of  it  remain,  the  northernmost  point  of  the  Lost  Coast 
Headlands  was  once  the  site  of  the  Centerville  Beach  Naval  Facility,  estab-
lished  in  1958  to  monitor  Soviet  submarines  during  the  Cold  War.  For 
more  than  100  years,  several  families  who  settled  nearby  grazed  livestock 
in the area. 
Cotoni-Coast Dairies 
Near  Davenport  in  Santa  Cruz  County,  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies  extends  from 
the  steep  slopes  of  the  Santa  Cruz  Mountains  to  the  marine  coastal  terraces 
overlooking  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Sitting  atop  the  soft  Santa  Cruz  Mudstone

Formation  and  the  hard,  silica-rich  Monterey  Formation,  the  area’s  bedrock 
supports  a  diversity  of  soils  and  vegetation  that  have  sustained  wildlife 
and people alike for millennia. 
Dating back at least 10,000 years, an ancestral group known to archaeologists 
as  the  Costanoan  or  Coastal  People  (also  called  the  Ohlone)  lived  in  this 
region,  and  the  Cotoni,  a  tribelet  of  this  group,  lived  in  the  Cotoni-Coast 
Dairies  area.  Lithic  scatter  sites  and  shell  middens  demonstrate  that  inhab-
itants moved between the coastal ecological zones and upland environments, 
making use of the landscape’s diverse resources. Europeans first made contact 
with  the  Cotoni  in  the  1600s  and  1700s.  Most  of  the  Costanoan  people 
were  converted  to  Christianity,  many  forcibly,  during  California’s  Mission 
period  in  the  late  1700s  and  1800s,  and  by  the  early  1900s,  much  of  the 
ancient  cultural  heritage  of  the  Coastal  People  was  left  only  to  memory. 
Six  perennial  streams  form  the  heart  of  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies’  ecosystem, 
flowing  from  the  coastal  mountains  down  to  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Molino 
Creek,  Ferrari  Creek,  San  Vicente  Creek,  Liddell  Creek,  Yellow  Bank  Creek, 
and  Laguna  Creek  have  each  carved  steep  canyons  on  their  path  to  the 
sea.  Vibrant  riparian  areas  follow  along  the  six  stream  corridors,  with  red 
alder  and  arroyo  willow  forests  dominating  the  vegetative  community.  A 
seventh stream, Scott Creek, flows along a small portion of the area’s northern 
boundary.  Most  of  the  area’s  wetlands  can  be  found  within  these  riparian 
corridors, though others exist in meadows and floodplains. 
Beyond supporting riparian and wetland communities, Cotoni-Coast Dairies’ 
waterways  provide  important  habitat  for  anadromous  and  freshwater  fish. 
All  of  the  streams  are  thought  to  have  historically  supported  salmon  popu-
lations.  Today,  the  threatened  steelhead  and  coho  salmon  can  be  found 
on  spawning  runs  in  San  Vicente  Creek,  while  steelhead  are  also  found 
in  Liddell  Creek  and  Laguna  Creek.  The  endangered  tidewater  goby  may 
also  be  found  in  the  tidally  influenced  portion  of  Laguna  Creek.  The  threat-
ened California red-legged frog uses many of the waterways and water sources 
here, along with a wide range of other amphibians and reptiles. 
Grasslands,  scrublands,  woodlands,  and  forests  surround  the  riparian  cor-
ridors  in  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies.  Purple  needlegrass  and  other  native  species, 
such as California oatgrass and blue wildrye, characterize the coastal prairie 
grassland community. The intermixed wildflowers in the community provide 
visitors a colorful display in the spring and early summer. Occasional fresh-
water seeps amid the grasslands support sedges, California buttercup, brown- 
headed rush, and other species. 
California  sagebrush  and  coyote  brush  scrub  communities  blanket  the  area’s 
bluffs  and  hillside  slopes.  Native  trees,  including  Douglas  fir  and  coast 
live  oak,  dominate  forests,  which  also  include  stands  of  coastal  trees  such 
as  madrone,  California  bay,  Monterey  pine,  and  knobcone  pine.  Visitors 
are  drawn  to  stands  of  coast  redwood,  which  thrive  on  the  north-facing 
slopes  in  some  watersheds,  accompanied  by  redwood  sorrel,  elk  clover, 
and other understory species. 
The  diversity  of  the  uplands  vegetation  in  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies  supports 
a  rich  wildlife  community  including  a  vast  and  varied  mammalian  popu-
lation. Among the many species inhabiting Cotoni-Coast Dairies are California 
voles,  dusky-footed  woodrats,  black-tailed  jackrabbits,  mule  deer,  and  gray 
fox.  Evidence  also  suggests  that  both  bobcats  and  mountain  lions  hunt 
here. 
Visitors  to  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies  may  be  able  to  catch  a  glimpse  of  a  variety 
of avian species, including black swifts, orange crowned warblers, American 
kestrels,  Cooper’s  hawks,  white-tailed  kites,  and  peregrine  falcons.  In  the 
riparian  areas,  one  may  encounter  Wilson’s  warblers,  downy  woodpeckers, 
and  tree  swallows,  among  others.  Various  bat  species,  including  the  Town-
send’s big-eared bat, can be seen darting overhead at dusk.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  11 / Wednesday,  January  18,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

Only  40  miles  north  of  San  Luis  Obispo,  the  large  white  coastal  rocks 
for which Piedras Blancas was named have served as a landmark for centuries 
to  explorers  and  traders  along  the  central  coast  of  California.  Sitting  at 
a  cultural  interface  between  Northern  Chumash  and  Playanos  Salinan  peo-
ples,  Piedras  Blancas  was  and  still  remains  important  to  Native  Americans. 
The  human  history  of  the  area  stretches  back  at  least  3,000  years,  and 
archaeologists  have  found  stone  tools,  debris  from  tool  knapping,  discrete 
quarrying  locations,  and  shell  midden  deposits  that  help  tell  that  history. 
Native  peoples  largely  used  the  area  as  a  source  of  raw  stone  and  for 
the manufacture of stone tools. 
In  1542,  the  Spanish  explorer  Juan  Rodriquez  Cabrillo  noted  the  value 
of  this  area  as  a  maritime  guidepost,  and  the  land  he  sighted  from  his 
ship was later claimed by the Spanish, followed by the Governor of Mexico, 
and  subsequently  became  part  of  the  United  States.  A  lighthouse  built  in 
the  1870s  still  stands  today,  albeit  without  the  three  upper  levels  that 
were removed after being damaged by an earthquake in 1948. The lighthouse, 
with its ornate brick and cast-iron structure, is listed in the National Register 
of  Historic  Places  along  with  its  surrounding  buildings,  such  as  the  1906 
fog-signal  and  oil  house.  Visitors  to  Piedras  Blancas  today  are  treated  to 
unmatched  scenic  vistas  of  the  rugged  mountain  peaks  of  the  Santa  Lucia 
Range  and  the  deep  blue  waters  of  the  Pacific  Ocean.  Dramatic  geologic 
features,  such  as  the  namesake  white  rocks,  along  with  the  area’s  char-
acteristic fog, contribute to a dynamic visual landscape. 
The  bedrock  in  the  area  consists  of  both  sedimentary  and  volcanic  rocks 
of the Franciscan Formation. This Formation represents Jurassic age material 
from the Pacific Plate that scraped off and attached to the continental margin 
of  North  America.  Atop  the  bedrock  lie  Monterey  Formation  rocks,  topped 
with  marine  terrace  deposits.  Rain  percolates  through  the  rock  surface  and 
sub-surface  and  emerges  dramatically  as  ephemeral  springs  from  cliff  faces. 
California  sea  lions,  harbor  seals,  and  northern  elephant  seals  all  spend 
time  on  the  shores  and  within  the  waters  of  this  area.  Visitors  may  observe 
colonies  of  massive  elephant  seals  loafing  in  the  sun  at  Piedras  Blancas, 
where females can be seen nursing their pups, and males occasionally battle 
for dominance. For decades, scientists have used this land to conduct annual 
censuses  of  the  threatened  southern  sea  otter  and  other  marine  mammals. 
From the mainland of Piedras Blancas, visitors can also be treated to regular 
visits by migrating gray and humpback whales, and occasionally blue, minke, 
and killer whales as well, in addition to bottlenose dolphins. 
Marine  birds  perched  on  or  soaring  over  the  Piedras  Blancas  rocks  include 
Brandt’s cormorants, black oystercatchers, peregrine falcons, and brown peli-
cans.  In  a  remarkable  spring  display,  Pacific  loons  can  be  seen  migrating 
offshore  of  Piedras  Blancas  by  the  tens  of  thousands.  In  the  rocky  intertidal 
zone  found  along  these  shores,  scientists  have  documented  mussels,  ochre 
starfish, barnacles, sea anemones, and black and red abalones. 
The  lighthouse’s  windswept  onshore  point  is  also  a  sanctuary  for  plants 
and  wildlife.  Over  70  types  of  native  plants,  including  members  from  the 
agave,  cashew,  sunflower,  carnation,  morning  glory,  gourd,  iris,  and  poppy 
families,  establish  a  foothold  in  the  fine  sand  and  fine  sandy  loam  soils. 
Together this diversity of vegetation can be characterized as northern coastal 
bluff  scrub.  If  visitors  time  their  visit,  they  will  be  treated  to  a  dazzling 
array  of  blooms  from  species  such  as  seaside  poppy,  seaside  daisy,  coastal 
bush  lupine,  hedge  nettle,  dune  buckwheat,  and  compact  cobwebby  thistle. 
This  native  vegetation  supports  many  wildlife  species,  including  brush  rab-
bits, California voles, dusky-footed woodrats, and bobcats. Black-bellied slen-
der salamanders, threatened red-legged frogs, western terrestrial garter snakes, 
and other reptiles and amphibians thrive in the Piedras Blancas area. 
Orange County Rocks and Islands 
This  area  consists  of  a  series  of  offshore  rocks,  pinnacles,  exposed  reefs, 
and  small  islands  off  the  Orange  County  coastline,  where  visitors  onshore

are  treated  to  dramatic  crashing  waves,  unique  geology,  and  an  abundance 
of marine-dependent wildlife. These rocks and islands lie within the current 
monument  boundary  but  were  not  previously  reserved  as  part  of  the  monu-
ment.  These  offshore  rocks,  many  in  pocket  coves,  contribute  to  the  rugged 
beauty  of  the  Orange  County  coastline  and  themselves  include  objects  of 
scientific  and  historic  interest.  The  features  also  provide  important 
connectivity  from  south  to  north  for  shore  birds  and  sea  birds,  as  well 
as for California sea lions and harbor seals. 
Cormorants,  brown  pelicans,  gulls,  and  a  variety  of  other  shore  birds  and 
sea  birds  can  be  seen  roosting,  resting,  and  feeding  on  the  jagged  rocks 
and small islands. These rocks and islands are also haul-out areas for marine 
mammals,  including  California  sea  lions,  harbor  seals,  and  the  occasional 
northern elephant seal. 
Rich  in  vital  nutrients,  this  offshore  zone  of  swirling  currents  supports 
a  variety  of  habitats  and  organisms.  The  tide  pools  around  these  rocks 
and islands are home to a diversity of hardy intertidal seaweeds and animal 
species  uniquely  adapted  for  survival  within  the  alternating  and  equally 
harsh environs of pounding surf and baking sun. 
The  protection  of  Trinidad  Head,  Waluplh-Lighthouse  Ranch,  Lost  Coast 
Headlands,  Cotoni-Coast  Dairies,  Piedras  Blancas,  and  Orange  County  Rocks 
and Islands as part of the California Coastal National Monument will preserve 
their  cultural,  prehistoric,  and  historic  legacy  and  maintain  their  diverse 
array  of  natural  and  scientific  resources,  ensuring  that  the  historic  and 
scientific  value  of  these  areas,  and  their  numerous  objects  of  historic  or 
scientific interest, remain for the benefit of all Americans. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits

21901 

Proclamation  9606  of  May  5,  2017 

National  Hurricane  Preparedness  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

National  Hurricane  Preparedness  Week  reminds  those  of  us  living  in  hurri-
cane-prone areas of the need to ready our homes, communities, and families 
for  extreme  weather  events  before  hurricane  season  arrives.  Preparing  for 
weather-related  disasters  can  dramatically  reduce  their  impact  on  you,  your 
family, and your community. 

The 2017 hurricane season, which begins June 1 and lasts through November 
30, marks the 25th anniversaries of Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. In August 
1992,  Hurricane  Andrew  tore  through  South  Florida  before  making  landfall, 
again, in Louisiana. It claimed 65 lives, destroyed 25,000 homes, and caused 
approximately  $26  billion  in  overall  damage.  A  few  weeks  later,  Hurricane 
Iniki  struck  the  Hawaiian  Island  of  Kauai,  killing  six,  demolishing  1,400 
homes,  and  causing  about  $1.8  billion  in  overall  damage.  The  tragic  losses 
caused  by  those  terrible  storms  remind  us  of  the  need  to  prepare  for  the 
destruction hurricanes can bring. 

As  Hurricane  Andrew  demonstrated,  inland  areas  are  not  immune  from 
the  destruction  hurricanes  can  bring  with  them  through  flooding  rains  and 
other related weather events. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminis-
tration  study  of  Hurricane  Andrew  revealed  that  most  of  the  damage  it 
caused  was  inland  from  the  primary  storm  surge  areas.  Just  last  year,  heavy 
rains  from  Hurricane  Matthew  caused  destructive  flooding  and  loss  of  life 
in  the  Carolinas,  even  though  the  hurricane’s  eye  remained  mostly  offshore. 

This  week,  through  several  initiatives,  I  am  encouraging  Americans  to  take 
the time to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. After a major disaster, 
you  may  not  have  immediate  access  to  the  services  you  are  accustomed 
to,  such  as  clean  water,  grocery  stores,  and  emergency  services.  Hurricane 
preparedness  information  provided  by  the  National  Weather  Service  (NWS) 
and  the  Ready  campaign  conducted  by  the  Federal  Emergency  Management 
Agency  (FEMA),  both  available  online,  outline  important  steps  you  can 
take right now to safeguard your family, pets, and property. These resources 
will  help  you  create  evacuation  and  communications  plans  and  assemble 
a  disaster  kit  of  necessary  supplies.  Developing  and  implementing  these 
plans will save lives and avoid excess damage. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  7  through 
May 13, 2017, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon Ameri-
cans  living  in  hurricane-prone  areas  to  observe  this  week  by  making  use 
of  the  online  resources  provided  by  the  NWS  and  FEMA  and  by  taking 
actions  to  safeguard  their  families,  homes,  and  businesses  from  the  dangers 
of  hurricanes.  I  also  call  upon  Federal,  State,  local,  tribal,  and  territorial 
emergency management officials to help inform our communities about hurri-
cane  preparedness  and  response,  in  order  to  help  prevent  storm  damage 
and save lives.

Proclamation  9594  of  April  24,  2017 

Days  of  Remembrance  of  Victims  of  the  Holocaust,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Yom  HaShoah—the  day  of  Holocaust  Remembrance—and  during  this 
Week  of  Remembrance,  we  honor  the  victims  of  the  Holocaust  and  Nazi 
persecution. 
The Holocaust was the state-sponsored, systematic persecution and attempted 
annihilation  of  European  Jewry  by  the  Nazi  regime  and  its  collaborators. 
By the end of World War II, six million Jews had been brutally slaughtered. 
The  Nazis  also  targeted  other  groups  for  persecution  and  murder,  including 
Roma  (Gypsies),  persons  with  mental  and  physical  disabilities,  Soviet  pris-
oners  of  war,  Jehovah’s  Witnesses,  Slavs  and  other  peoples  of  Europe,  gays, 
and political opponents. 
The  United  States  stands  shoulder  to  shoulder  with  the  survivors  of  the 
Holocaust, their families, and the descendants of those who were murdered. 
We  support  the  Jewish  diaspora  and  the  State  of  Israel  as  we  fulfill  our 
duty  to  remember  the  victims,  honor  their  memory  and  their  lives,  and 
celebrate  humanity’s  victory  over  tyranny  and  evil.  Holocaust  survivors, 
despite scars from history’s darkest days, continue to inspire us to remember 
the past and learn from its lessons. By sharing their experiences and wisdom, 
they  continue  to  fuel  our  resolve  to  advance  human  rights  and  to  combat 
antisemitism and other forms of hatred. 
During this week in 1945, American and Allied forces liberated the concentra-
tion  camp  at  Dachau  and  other  Nazi  death  camps,  laying  bare  to  the  world 
the unconscionable horror of the Holocaust. We must remain vigilant against 
hateful  ideologies  and  indifference.  Every  generation  must  learn  and  apply 
the  lessons  of  the  Holocaust  so  that  such  horror,  atrocity,  and  genocide 
never  again  occur.  It  is  our  solemn  obligation  to  reaffirm  our  commitment 
to respecting the fundamental freedoms and inherent dignity of every human 
being. 
Let  us  join  together  to  remember  and  honor  the  victims  of  the  Holocaust 
and  Nazi  persecution.  We  express  our  eternal  gratitude  to  the  liberators 
who  selflessly  risked  their  lives  to  save  those  of  others,  and  we  pledge 
to never be bystanders to evil. 
We must never forget. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  ask  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  the 
Days  of  Remembrance  of  Victims  of  the  Holocaust,  April  23  through  April 
30, 2017, and the solemn anniversary of the liberation of Nazi death camps, 
with appropriate study, prayers and commemoration, and to honor the mem-
ory  of  the  victims  of  the  Holocaust  and  Nazi  persecution  by  internalizing 
the lessons of this atrocity so that it is never repeated.

To  avert  the  entry  into  the  United  States  of  foreign  nationals  who  may 
aid,  support,  or  commit  violent,  criminal,  or  terrorist  acts,  it  is  critical 
that  the  executive  branch  enhance  the  screening  and  vetting  protocols  and 
procedures for granting visas, admission to the United States, or other benefits 
under  the  INA.  For  that  reason,  in  the  executive  order  entitled,  ‘‘Protecting 
the  Nation  from  Foreign  Terrorist  Entry  into  the  United  States,’’  and  issued 
today,  I  directed  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  in  consultation  with 
the  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  to  conduct 
a  review  to  ‘‘identify  whether,  and  if  so  what,  additional  information  will 
be  needed  from  each  foreign  country  to  adjudicate  an  application  by  a 
national  of  that  country  for  a  visa,  admission,  or  other  benefit  under  the 
INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security 
or public-safety threat.’’ 
While  that  comprehensive  review  is  ongoing,  however,  this  Nation  cannot 
delay the immediate implementation of additional heightened screening and 
vetting protocols and procedures for issuing visas to ensure that we strength-
en the safety and security of our country. 
Moreover,  because  it  is  my  constitutional  duty  to  ‘‘take  Care  that  the  Laws 
be  faithfully  executed,’’  the  executive  branch  is  committed  to  ensuring  that 
all  laws  related  to  entry  into  the  United  States  are  enforced  rigorously 
and consistently. 
Sec.  2.  Enhanced  Vetting  Protocols  and  Procedures  for  Visas  and  Other 
Immigration  Benefits.  The  Secretary  of  State  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security,  in  consultation  with  the  Attorney  General,  shall,  as  permitted 
by  law,  implement  protocols  and  procedures  as  soon  as  practicable  that 
in  their  judgment  will  enhance  the  screening  and  vetting  of  applications 
for  visas  and  all  other  immigration  benefits,  so  as  to  increase  the  safety 
and  security  of  the  American  people.  These  additional  protocols  and  proce-
dures should focus on: 

(a)  preventing  the  entry  into  the  United  States  of  foreign  nationals  who 

may aid, support, or commit violent, criminal, or terrorist acts; and 

(b) ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary to rigorously 
evaluate  all  grounds  of  inadmissibility  or  deportability,  or  grounds  for  the 
denial of other immigration benefits.

Sec.  3.  Enforcement  of  All  Laws  for  Entry  into  the  United  States.  I  direct 
the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland 
Security,  and  the  heads  of  all  other  relevant  executive  departments  and 
agencies  (as  identified  by  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security)  to  rigorously 
enforce  all  existing  grounds  of  inadmissibility  and  to  ensure  subsequent 
compliance  with  related  laws  after  admission.  The  heads  of  all  relevant 
executive  departments  and  agencies  shall  issue  new  rules,  regulations,  or 
guidance  (collectively,  rules),  as  appropriate,  to  enforce  laws  relating  to 
such  grounds  of  inadmissibility  and  subsequent  compliance.  To  the  extent 
that  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  issues  such  new  rules,  the  heads 
of  all  other  relevant  executive  departments  and  agencies  shall,  as  necessary 
and  appropriate,  issue  new  rules  that  conform  to  them.  Such  new  rules 
shall supersede any previous rules to the extent of any conflict. 
Sec.  4.  Transparency  and  Data  Collection.  (a)  To  ensure  that  the  American 
people  have  more  regular  access  to  information,  and  to  ensure  that  the 
executive  branch  shares  information  among  its  departments  and  agencies, 
the  Secretary  of  State  and  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall,  consistent 
with  applicable  law  and  national  security,  issue  regular  reports  regarding 
visas  and  adjustments  of  immigration  status,  written  in  non-technical  lan-
guage  for  broad  public  use  and  understanding.  In  addition  to  any  other 
information  released  by  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  or 
the Secretary of Homeland Security: 

(i)  Beginning  on  April  28,  2017,  and  by  the  last  day  of  every  month 
thereafter,  the  Secretary  of  State  shall  publish  the  following  information 
about actions taken during the preceding calendar month: 

(A)  the  number  of  visas  that  have  been  issued  from  each  consular 
office  within  each  country  during  the  reporting  period,  disaggregated  by 
detailed visa category and country of issuance; and 

(B)  any  other  information  the  Secretary  of  State  considers  appropriate, 
including information that the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland 
Security may request be published. 
(ii)  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall  issue  reports  detailing  the 
number  of  adjustments  of  immigration  status  that  have  been  made  during 
the reporting period, disaggregated by type of adjustment, type and detailed 
class  of  admission,  and  country  of  nationality.  The  first  report  shall  be 
issued  within  90  days  of  the  date  of  this  memorandum,  and  subsequent 
reports  shall  be  issued  every  90  days  thereafter.  The  first  report  shall 
address data from the date of this memorandum until the report is issued, 
and  each  subsequent  report  shall  address  new  data  since  the  last  report 
was issued. 
(b)  To  further  ensure  transparency  for  the  American  people  regarding 
the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  our  immigration  programs  in  serving 
the national interest, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary 
of  Health  and  Human  Services,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  and 
the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget,  shall,  within  180 
days  of  the  date  of  this  memorandum,  submit  to  me  a  report  detailing 
the  estimated  long-term  costs  of  the  United  States  Refugee  Admissions  Pro-
gram  at  the  Federal,  State,  and  local  levels,  along  with  recommendations 
about how to curtail those costs. 

(c)  The  Secretary  of  State,  in  consultation  with  the  Director  of  the  Office 
of  Management  and  Budget,  shall,  within  180  days  of  the  date  of  this 
memorandum,  produce  a  report  estimating  how  many  refugees  are  being 
supported  in  countries  of  first  asylum  (near  their  home  countries)  for  the 
same  long-term  cost  as  supporting  refugees  in  the  United  States,  taking 
into  account  the  full  lifetime  cost  of  Federal,  State,  and  local  benefits, 
and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere. 
Sec.  5.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  memorandum  shall  be  con-
strued to impair or otherwise affect: 

(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

10691 

Executive  Order  13773  of  February  9,  2017 

Enforcing  Federal  Law  With  Respect  to  Transnational  Crimi-
nal  Organizations  and  Preventing  International  Trafficking 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 

Section 1. Purpose. Transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary orga-
nizations,  including  transnational  drug  cartels,  have  spread  throughout  the 
Nation,  threatening  the  safety  of  the  United  States  and  its  citizens.  These 
organizations  derive  revenue  through  widespread  illegal  conduct,  including 
acts  of  violence  and  abuse  that  exhibit  a  wanton  disregard  for  human  life. 
They,  for  example,  have  been  known  to  commit  brutal  murders,  rapes, 
and other barbaric acts. 

These  groups  are  drivers  of  crime,  corruption,  violence,  and  misery.  In 
particular,  the  trafficking  by  cartels  of  controlled  substances  has  triggered 
a  resurgence  in  deadly  drug  abuse  and  a  corresponding  rise  in  violent 
crime  related  to  drugs.  Likewise,  the  trafficking  and  smuggling  of  human 
beings  by  transnational  criminal  groups  risks  creating  a  humanitarian  crisis. 
These  crimes,  along  with  many  others,  are  enriching  and  empowering  these 
organizations to the detriment of the American people. 

A comprehensive and decisive approach is required to dismantle these orga-
nized crime syndicates and restore safety for the American people. 

Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to: 

(a) strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational 
criminal  organizations  and  subsidiary  organizations,  including  criminal 
gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit 
activities  that  present  a  threat  to  public  safety  and  national  security  and 
that are related to, for example: 

(i)  the  illegal  smuggling  and  trafficking  of  humans,  drugs  or  other  sub-
stances, wildlife, and weapons; 

(ii)  corruption,  cybercrime,  fraud,  financial  crimes,  and  intellectual-prop-
erty theft; or 

(iii)  the  illegal  concealment  or  transfer  of  proceeds  derived  from  such 
illicit activities. 
(b)  ensure  that  Federal  law  enforcement  agencies  give  a  high  priority 
and  devote  sufficient  resources  to  efforts  to  identify,  interdict,  disrupt,  and 
dismantle  transnational  criminal  organizations  and  subsidiary  organizations, 
including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of mem-
bers of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations 
to  face  justice  in  the  United  States  and,  where  appropriate  and  to  the 
extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign 
nationals who are members of such organizations; 

(c)  maximize  the  extent  to  which  all  Federal  agencies  share  information 
and  coordinate  with  Federal  law  enforcement  agencies,  as  permitted  by 
law,  in  order  to  identify,  interdict,  and  dismantle  transnational  criminal 
organizations and subsidiary organizations;

(d)  enhance  cooperation  with  foreign  counterparts  against  transnational 
criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appro-
priate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforce-
ment information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign 
partners  by  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security; 
(e)  develop  strategies,  under  the  guidance  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  the 
Attorney  General,  and  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security,  to  maximize 
coordination  among  agencies—such  as  through  the  Organized  Crime  Drug 
Enforcement  Task  Forces  (OCDETF),  Special  Operations  Division,  the 
OCDETF  Fusion  Center,  and  the  International  Organized  Crime  Intelligence 
and  Operations  Center—to  counter  the  crimes  described  in  subsection  (a) 
of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and 

(f) pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success 
of  transnational  criminal  organizations  and  subsidiary  organizations  within 
and  beyond  the  United  States,  to  include  prosecution  of  ancillary  criminal 
offenses,  such  as  immigration  fraud  and  visa  fraud,  and  the  seizure  of 
the  implements  of  such  organizations  and  forfeiture  of  the  proceeds  of 
their criminal activity. 
Sec.  3.  Implementation.  In  furtherance  of  the  policy  set  forth  in  section 
2  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  State,  the  Attorney  General,  the  Secretary 
of  Homeland  Security,  and  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence,  or  their 
designees, shall co-chair and direct the existing interagency Threat Mitigation 
Working Group (TMWG), which shall: 

(a)  work  to  support  and  improve  the  coordination  of  Federal  agencies’ 
efforts 
investigate,  prosecute,  and  dismantle 
transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and 
beyond the United States; 

interdict, 

identify, 

to 

(b)  work  to  improve  Federal  agencies’  provision,  collection,  reporting, 
and  sharing  of,  and  access  to,  data  relevant  to  Federal  efforts  against 
transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; 

(c) work to increase intelligence and law enforcement information sharing 
with  foreign  partners  battling  transnational  criminal  organizations  and  sub-
sidiary  organizations,  and  to  enhance  international  operational  capabilities 
and cooperation; 

(d) assess Federal agencies’ allocation of monetary and personnel resources 
for identifying, interdicting, and dismantling transnational criminal organiza-
tions  and  subsidiary  organizations,  as  well  as  any  resources  that  should 
be redirected toward these efforts; 

(e) identify Federal agencies’ practices, any absence of practices, and fund-
ing needs that might hinder Federal efforts to effectively combat transnational 
criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations; 

(f)  review  relevant  Federal  laws  to  determine  existing  ways  in  which 
to identify, interdict, and disrupt the activity of transnational criminal organi-
zations  and  subsidiary  organizations,  and  ascertain  which  statutory  authori-
ties,  including  provisions  under  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act,  could 
be better enforced or amended to prevent foreign members of these organiza-
tions  or  their  associates  from  obtaining  entry  into  the  United  States  and 
from exploiting the United States immigration system; 

(g)  in  the  interest  of  transparency  and  public  safety,  and  in  compliance 
with  all  applicable  law,  including  the  Privacy  Act,  issue  reports  at  least 
once  per  quarter  detailing  convictions  in  the  United  States  relating  to 
transnational criminal organizations and their subsidiaries; 

(h)  to  the  extent  deemed  useful  by  the  Co-Chairs,  and  in  their  discretion, 
identify  methods  for  Federal  agencies  to  coordinate,  as  permitted  by  law, 
with  State,  tribal,  and  local  governments  and  law  enforcement  agencies, 
foreign  law  enforcement  partners,  public-health  organizations,  and  non-gov-
ernmental  organizations  in  order  to  aid  in  the  identification,  interdiction,

Executive  Order  13800  of  May  11,  2017 

Strengthening  the  Cybersecurity  of  Federal  Networks  and 
Critical  Infrastructure 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  to  protect  American  innovation 
and values, it is hereby ordered as follows: 

Section 1. Cybersecurity of Federal Networks. 

(a)  Policy.  The  executive  branch  operates  its  information  technology  (IT) 
on behalf of the American people. Its IT and data should be secured respon-
sibly  using  all  United  States  Government  capabilities.  The  President  will 
hold heads of executive departments and agencies (agency heads) accountable 
for  managing  cybersecurity  risk  to  their  enterprises.  In  addition,  because 
risk  management  decisions  made  by  agency  heads  can  affect  the  risk  to 
the  executive  branch  as  a  whole,  and  to  national  security,  it  is  also  the 
policy  of  the  United  States  to  manage  cybersecurity  risk  as  an  executive 
branch enterprise. 

(b) Findings. 
(i)  Cybersecurity  risk  management  comprises  the  full  range  of  activities 
undertaken  to  protect  IT  and  data  from  unauthorized  access  and  other 
cyber  threats,  to  maintain  awareness  of  cyber  threats,  to  detect  anomalies 
and  incidents  adversely  affecting  IT  and  data,  and  to  mitigate  the  impact 
of,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  incidents.  Information  sharing  facilitates 
and supports all of these activities. 

(ii) The executive branch has for too long accepted antiquated and difficult- 
to-defend IT. 

(iii)  Effective  risk  management  involves  more  than  just  protecting  IT  and 
data  currently  in  place.  It  also  requires  planning  so  that  maintenance, 
improvements,  and  modernization  occur  in  a  coordinated  way  and  with 
appropriate regularity. 

(iv) Known but unmitigated vulnerabilities are among the highest cyberse-
curity risks faced by executive departments and agencies (agencies). Known 
vulnerabilities  include  using  operating  systems  or  hardware  beyond  the 
vendor’s  support  lifecycle,  declining  to  implement  a  vendor’s  security 
patch, or failing to execute security-specific configuration guidance. 

(v)  Effective  risk  management  requires  agency  heads  to  lead  integrated 
teams of senior executives with expertise in IT, security, budgeting, acquisi-
tion, law, privacy, and human resources. 
(c) Risk Management. 
(i)  Agency  heads  will  be  held  accountable  by  the  President  for  imple-
menting risk management measures commensurate with the risk and mag-
nitude of the harm that would result from unauthorized access, use, disclo-
sure,  disruption,  modification,  or  destruction  of  IT  and  data.  They  will 
also  be  held  accountable  by  the  President  for  ensuring  that  cybersecurity 
risk  management  processes  are  aligned  with  strategic,  operational,  and 
budgetary  planning  processes,  in  accordance  with  chapter  35,  subchapter 
II of title 44, United States Code.

able, reliable, and secure internet that fosters efficiency, innovation, commu-
nication,  and  economic  prosperity,  while  respecting  privacy  and  guarding 
against  disruption,  fraud,  and  theft.  Further,  the  United  States  seeks  to

rorism,  on  the  Nation’s  strategic  options  for  deterring  adversaries  and  better 
protecting the American people from cyber threats. 

(c)  International  Cooperation.  As  a  highly  connected  nation,  the  United 
States  is  especially  dependent  on  a  globally  secure  and  resilient  internet 
and must work with allies and other partners toward maintaining the policy 
set  forth  in  this  section.  Within  45  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the

Proclamation  9604  of  May  1,  2017 

Law  Day,  U.S.A.,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Today,  we  celebrate  Law  Day,  as  we  have  since  President  Dwight  D.  Eisen-
hower  first  commemorated  it  in  1958,  and  reflect  upon  our  great  heritage 
of  liberty,  justice,  and  equality.  Our  Founders  risked  their  lives,  fortunes, 
and  sacred  honor  in  defense  of  these  values.  More  than  240  years  ago, 
they  set  pen  to  paper  and  declared  to  the  world  ‘‘that  all  men  are  created 
equal,  that  they  are  endowed  by  their  Creator  with  certain  unalienable 
Rights,  that  among  these  are  Life,  Liberty  and  the  pursuit  of  Happiness.’’ 
The  Declaration  of  Independence  thus  set  our  Nation  on  its  revolutionary 
and  transformative  path  to  protecting  people’s  inherent,  individual  rights 
and  liberties  from  the  tyranny  of  an  elite  few  who  might  use  the  powers 
of the state to trample upon them. 
To protect the values for which they fought, the Framers of our Constitution 
created  a  government  of  limited  and  separated  powers  that  enables  the 
rule  of  law  to  prevail  over  the  whims  of  government  officials.  As  the  great 
Justice  Antonin  Scalia  frequently  observed,  every  dictatorship  has  a  bill 
of  rights,  but  paper  rights  alone  will  not  preserve  liberty.  It  is  our  Constitu-
tion’s  clear  division  of  the  sovereign’s  power—vesting  the  power  to  create 
laws  in  the  Congress,  the  power  to  execute  laws  in  the  President,  and 
the  power  to  interpret  laws  in  an  independent  judiciary—that  enables  us 
to remain free and in control of our government. 
Recognizing,  as  President  Ronald  Reagan  did,  that  ‘‘freedom  is  never  more 
than  one  generation  away  from  extinction,’’  today  we  pay  tribute  to  the 
government  of  laws,  and  not  of  men,  that  forms  the  foundation  of  our 
freedom.  Therefore,  on  this  Law  Day,  we  rededicate  ourselves  to  the  rule 
of law, to the separation of powers, and, in the words of President Abraham 
Lincoln’s  Gettysburg  Address,  to  the  preservation  of  ‘‘government  of  the 
people, by the people, for the people.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  in  accordance  with  Public  Law  87–20,  as  amended,  do  hereby 
proclaim  May  1,  2017,  as  Law  Day,  U.S.A.  I  urge  all  Americans,  including 
government  officials,  to  observe  this  day  by  reflecting  upon  the  importance 
of  the  rule  of  law  in  our  Nation  and  displaying  the  flag  of  the  United 
States in support of this national observance.

16093 

Executive  Order  13783  of  March  28,  2017 

Promoting  Energy  Independence  and  Economic  Growth 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  (a)  It  is  in  the  national  interest  to  promote  clean  and 
safe  development  of  our  Nation’s  vast  energy  resources,  while  at  the  same 
time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy produc-
tion,  constrain  economic  growth,  and  prevent  job  creation.  Moreover,  the 
prudent  development  of  these  natural  resources  is  essential  to  ensuring 
the Nation’s geopolitical security. 

(b) It is further in the national interest to ensure that the Nation’s electricity 
is  affordable,  reliable,  safe,  secure,  and  clean,  and  that  it  can  be  produced 
from  coal,  natural  gas,  nuclear  material,  flowing  water,  and  other  domestic 
sources, including renewable sources. 

(c) Accordingly, it is the policy of the United States that executive depart-
ments  and  agencies  (agencies)  immediately  review  existing  regulations  that 
potentially burden the development or use of domestically produced energy 
resources  and  appropriately  suspend,  revise,  or  rescind  those  that  unduly 
burden  the  development  of  domestic  energy  resources  beyond  the  degree 
necessary  to  protect  the  public  interest  or  otherwise  comply  with  the  law. 
(d) It further is the policy of the United States that, to the extent permitted 
by  law,  all  agencies  should  take  appropriate  actions  to  promote  clean  air 
and  clean  water  for  the  American  people,  while  also  respecting  the  proper 
roles of the Congress and the States concerning these matters in our constitu-
tional republic. 

(e) It is also the policy of the United States that necessary and appropriate 
environmental  regulations  comply  with  the  law,  are  of  greater  benefit  than 
cost,  when  permissible,  achieve  environmental  improvements  for  the  Amer-
ican  people,  and  are  developed  through  transparent  processes  that  employ 
the best available peer-reviewed science and economics. 
Sec.  2.  Immediate  Review  of  All  Agency  Actions  that  Potentially  Burden 
the Safe, Efficient Development of Domestic Energy Resources. (a) The heads 
of agencies shall review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, 
policies,  and  any  other  similar  agency  actions  (collectively,  agency  actions) 
that  potentially  burden  the  development  or  use  of  domestically  produced 
energy  resources,  with  particular  attention  to  oil,  natural  gas,  coal,  and 
nuclear  energy  resources.  Such  review  shall  not  include  agency  actions 
that  are  mandated  by  law,  necessary  for  the  public  interest,  and  consistent 
with the policy set forth in section 1 of this order. 

(b)  For  purposes  of  this  order,  ‘‘burden’’  means  to  unnecessarily  obstruct, 
delay, curtail, or otherwise impose significant costs on the siting, permitting, 
production, utilization, transmission, or delivery of energy resources. 

(c)  Within  45  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  head  of  each  agency 
with agency actions described in subsection (a) of this section shall develop 
and  submit  to  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (OMB 
Director)  a  plan  to  carry  out  the  review  required  by  subsection  (a)  of  this 
section.  The  plans  shall  also  be  sent  to  the  Vice  President,  the  Assistant 
to  the  President  for  Economic  Policy,  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for 
Domestic  Policy,  and  the  Chair  of  the  Council  on  Environmental  Quality. 
The  head  of  any  agency  who  determines  that  such  agency  does  not  have

the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Economic  Policy,  the  Assistant  to  the 
President for Domestic Policy, and the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
Quality.  The  report  shall  include  specific  recommendations  that,  to  the 
extent  permitted  by  law,  could  alleviate  or  eliminate  aspects  of  agency 
actions that burden domestic energy production. 

(e)  The  report  shall  be  finalized  within  180  days  of  the  date  of  this 
order,  unless  the  OMB  Director,  in  consultation  with  the  other  officials 
who receive the draft final reports, extends that deadline. 

(f)  The  OMB  Director,  in  consultation  with  the  Assistant  to  the  President 
for Economic Policy, shall be responsible for coordinating the recommended 
actions  included  in  the  agency  final  reports  within  the  Executive  Office 
of the President. 

(g) With respect to any agency action for which specific recommendations 
are  made  in  a  final  report  pursuant  to  subsection  (e)  of  this  section,  the 
head  of  the  relevant  agency  shall,  as  soon  as  practicable,  suspend,  revise, 
or  rescind,  or  publish  for  notice  and  comment  proposed  rules  suspending, 
revising,  or  rescinding,  those  actions,  as  appropriate  and  consistent  with 
law.  Agencies  shall  endeavor  to  coordinate  such  regulatory  reforms  with 
their  activities  undertaken  in  compliance  with  Executive  Order  13771  of 
January  30,  2017  (Reducing  Regulation  and  Controlling  Regulatory  Costs).

entitled ‘‘Final Guidance for Federal Departments and Agencies on Consider-
ation  of  Greenhouse  Gas  Emissions  and  the  Effects  of  Climate  Change  in 
National Environmental Policy Act Reviews,’’ which is referred to in ‘‘Notice 
of Availability,’’ 81 Fed. Reg. 51866 (August 5, 2016). 

(d) The heads of all agencies shall identify existing agency actions related 
to  or  arising  from  the  Presidential  actions  listed  in  subsection  (a)  of  this 
section,  the  reports  listed  in  subsection  (b)  of  this  section,  or  the  final

The  President

Proclamation  9577  of  March  6,  2017 

National  Consumer  Protection  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  economic  strength  and  vitality  of  our  Nation  is  directly  linked  to  our 
consumers’ confidence in the integrity and security of their personal informa-
tion  and  the  robust  protection  of  their  privacy.  As  an  increasing  number 
of  transactions  and  activities  occur  online,  the  safety  of  vital  consumer 
information  is  increasingly  at  risk.  The  American  people  deserve  freedom 
from unscrupulous actors who perpetrate identity theft, abuse personal infor-
mation, or engage in fraud. 
Cyber  crimes,  which  defraud  hard-working  Americans,  cost  our  families 
billions  of  dollars  each  year  and  result  in  tremendous  stress,  loss  of  time, 
and  hardship.  Americans  must  have  access  to  the  tools  necessary  to  protect 
their personal information and privacy and know how to use them to improve 
their  online  security.  Our  first  defense  against  fraudulent  cyber  transactions 
and  the  misuse  of  personal  information  will  always  be  a  well-informed 
consumer. 
National Consumer Protection Week reminds us of the importance of empow-
ering  consumers  by  helping  them  to  more  capably  identify  and  report  cyber 
scams,  monitor  their  online  privacy  and  security,  and  make  well-informed 
decisions.  The  Federal  Government,  in  conjunction  with  a  network  of  na-
tional  organizations  and  State  and  local  partners,  provides  consumer  edu-
cation resources to help Americans protect their personal information. These 
resources  assist  military  service  members  and  their  families,  identity-theft 
victims,  and  all  potentially  vulnerable  consumers.  Our  work  to  protect  con-
sumers  from  identity  theft,  abuse  of  personal  information,  and  fraud,  and 
to  improve  the  integrity  and  security  of  our  marketplaces,  enhances  the 
prosperity of our great country. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  5  through 
March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon govern-
ment officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate our citizens about 
the  protection  of  personal  information  and  identity  theft  through  consumer 
education activities in communities across the country.

As  President,  my  highest  priority  is  to  ensure  the  safety  and  security  of 
the  American  people.  In  order  to  advise  and  assist  me  in  executing  this 
solemn responsibility, as well as to protect and advance the national interests 
of  the  United  States  at  home  and  abroad,  I  hereby  direct  that  my  system 
for national security policy development and decision-making shall be orga-
nized as follows: 
A.  The  National  Security  Council,  the  Homeland  Security  Council,  and 
Supporting Staff 
The  National  Security  Act  of  1947,  as  amended,  established  the  National 
Security Council (NSC) to advise the President with respect to the integration 
of  domestic,  foreign,  and  military  policies  relating  to  the  national  security. 
There is also a Homeland Security Council (HSC)—established through Exec-
utive  Order  13228  of  October  8,  2001,  and  subsequently  codified  in  the 
Homeland Security Act of 2002—that has the purpose of advising the Presi-
dent on matters pertaining to homeland security. Each Council is also respon-
sible for the effective coordination of the security-related activities and func-
tions of the executive departments and agencies. 
The  security  threats  facing  the  United  States  in  the  21st  century  transcend 
international boundaries. Accordingly, the United States Government’s deci-
sion-making structures and processes to address these challenges must remain 
equally  adaptive  and  transformative.  Both  Councils  are  statutory  bodies  that

Council meetings shall be extended to those heads of executive departments 
and  agencies,  and  other  senior  officials,  who  are  needed  to  address  the 
issue  or  issues  under  consideration.  When  the  President  is  absent  from 
a meeting of either Council, the Vice President may preside at the President’s

Advisor)  and  the  Assistant  to  the  President  for  Homeland  Security  and

will  be  transmitted  to  the  Executive  Secretary  for  appropriate  distribution 
and  awareness.  The  purpose  of  the  NSC  staff  is  to  advise  me,  the  National 
Security  Advisor,  the  Homeland  Security  Advisor,  the  NSC  members,  the 
HSC  members,  and  others  in  the  White  House;  to  facilitate  the  implementa-
tion  of  Administration  policy;  and  to  help  coordinate  the  national-security-

senior interagency forum for considering policy issues that affect the national 
security interests of the United States. The PC shall be convened and chaired

The DC is responsible for establishing Policy Coordination Committees (PCCs) 
and for providing objectives and clear guidance. 
D. Policy Coordination Committees 
Management  of  the  development  and  implementation  of  national  security 
policies  by  multiple  executive  departments  and  agencies  typically  shall  be 
accomplished  by  the  PCCs,  with  participation  primarily  occurring  at  the 
Assistant Secretary level. As the main day-to-day fora for interagency coordi-
nation  of  national  security  policies,  the  PCCs  shall  provide  policy  analysis 
for  consideration  by  the  more  senior  committees  of  the  national  security 
system and ensure timely responses to the President’s decisions. 
Regional  and  issue-related  PCCs  shall  be  established  at  the  direction  of 
the  DC.  Members  of  the  NSC  staff  (or  National  Economic  Council  staff, 
as  appropriate)  will  chair  the  PCCs;  the  DC,  at  its  discretion,  may  add 
co-chairs to any PCC. The PCCs shall review and coordinate the implementa-
tion  of  Presidential  decisions  in  their  respective  policy  areas.  The  Chair 
of  each  PCC,  in  consultation  with  the  Executive  Secretary,  shall  invite  rep-
resentatives  of  other  executive  departments  and  agencies  to  attend  meetings 
of  the  PCC  where  appropriate.  The  Chair  of  each  PCC,  with  the  agreement 
of  the  Executive  Secretary,  may  establish  subordinate  working  groups  to 
assist that PCC in the performance of its duties. 
An  early  meeting  of  the  DC  will  be  devoted  to  establishing  the  PCCs, 
determining  their  memberships,  and  providing  them  with  mandates  and 
strict  guidance.  Until  the  DC  has  established  otherwise,  the  existing  system 
of Interagency Policy Committees shall continue. 
E. General 
The  President  and  the  Vice  President  may  attend  any  and  all  meetings 
of any entity established by or under this memorandum.

States  shall  be  flown  at  half-staff  at  the  White  House  and  upon  all  public

vessels and stations. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  fifth  day  of

ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

The  President 

Proclamation  9644  of  September  22,  2017 

Gold  Star  Mother’s  and  Family’s  Day,  2017 

45159 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  we  solemnly  observe  Gold  Star  Mother’s  and  Family’s  Day,  we  honor 
and extend our deepest gratitude to the families of military service members 
who  gave  their  last  full  measure  of  devotion  to  our  country.  Gold  Star 
families  have  paid  the  ultimate  price  for  our  Nation’s  freedom  with  the 
life  of  their  loved  ones.  Our  grateful  Nation  grieves  with  them  in  their 
loss,  but  also  shares  their  pride  in  the  selfless  service  of  their  sons  and 
daughters. 
Our country is built on the sacrifices of men and women who have willingly 
raised  their  hand  to  defend  our  Nation  and  its  security.  As  members  of 
our  Armed  Forces  take  an  oath  to  protect  our  freedoms  and  liberty,  they 
understand  the  gravity  of  their  commitment  to  defend  our  way  of  life. 
And  when  that  commitment  results  in  the  ultimate  sacrifice,  we  come  to-
gether  as  a  Nation  to  walk  beside  the  devoted  families  left  behind  and 
help  them  shoulder  the  vast  absence  they  forever  bear.  Their  loved  ones 
did  not  die  in  vain.  They  gave  of  themselves  to  protect  and  defend  the 
freedoms  we  all  enjoy.  Despite  their  grief,  these  families  bravely  move  for-
ward with dignity and grace. 
Despite  having  endured  unfathomable  loss,  many  Gold  Star  families  have 
turned  their  sorrow  into  action  and  community  outreach  to  help  others 
navigate  this  difficult  journey.  Their  compassion,  courage,  determination, 
and strength inspire us all. 
When  the  last  rifle  volley  is  fired,  the  final  note  of  Taps  echoes  and  fades 
away, and the carefully-folded National Colors are presented, it is our sacred 
duty  to  stand  with  these  patriotic  families  to  ensure  they  receive  the  care, 
compassion,  and  respect  they  have  earned.  On  this  day  of  remembrance, 
we pay tribute to those brave men and women in uniform who died protecting 
our  great  Nation,  and  we  stand  with  the  families  who  nurtured  and  loved 
them.  Gold  Star  families  have  our  sympathy,  but  more  importantly,  they 
have our respect and our gratitude. 
The  Congress,  by  Senate  Joint  Resolution  115  of  June  23,  1936  (49  Stat. 
1895  as  amended),  has  designated  the  last  Sunday  in  September  as  ‘‘Gold 
Star Mother’s Day.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  24,  2017, 
as Gold Star Mother’s and Family’s Day. I call upon all Government officials 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  over  Government  buildings  on 
this  special  day.  I  also  encourage  the  American  people  to  display  the  flag 
and  hold  appropriate  ceremonies  as  a  public  expression  of  our  Nation’s 
gratitude and respect for our Gold Star Mothers and Families.

Proclamation  9623  of  June  14,  2017 

Flag  Day  and  National  Flag  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Flag  Day,  we  honor  the  symbol  that  reminds  us  that  we  are  one  Nation 
under  God,  united  in  our  pursuit  of  liberty  and  justice  for  all.  Today, 
we celebrate and recognize June 14 as the day in 1777 when the Continental 
Congress  formally  adopted  the  Stars  and  Stripes  as  the  official  flag  of  the 
Republic. 
Our  flag  is  a  source  of  inspiration  and  strength  to  all  Americans.  Wherever 
Old  Glory  flies,  we  remember  the  six  United  States  Marines  raising  the 
flag  atop  Mount  Suribachi  during  the  Battle  of  Iwo  Jima,  astronauts  Neil 
Armstrong  and  Buzz  Aldrin  planting  it  on  the  surface  of  the  moon,  and 
our firefighters elevating it above Ground Zero following the terrorist attacks 
of  September  11.  At  the  White  House,  at  our  homes,  churches,  offices, 
and  schools,  in  our  town  squares  and  military  installations  at  home  and 
abroad,  our  flag  celebrates  our  independence  and  highlights  our  resolve 
to defend and protect the country and the values that we hold dear. 
By  honoring  our  flag,  we  pay  due  respect  to  the  patriots  and  heroes  who 
have  laid  down  their  lives  in  defense  of  the  liberty  it  represents.  As  we 
raise  the  flag,  we  stand  and  salute  or  place  our  hands  on  our  hearts,  and 
we  recall  the  fundamental  truths  upon  which  this  Nation  was  founded: 
that  we  are  all  created  equal  and  that  just  government  derives  its  power 
from the people. 
I  am  blessed  to  have  shared  my  birthday  with  the  Star  Spangled  Banner 
and  the  U.S.  Army  for  71  years  now.  Again,  on  Flag  Day,  I  am  deeply 
grateful  to  live  under  the  red,  white,  and  blue,  and  all  for  which  it  stands. 
To  commemorate  the  adoption  of  our  flag,  in  1949,  the  Congress  requested 
the  President  recognize,  by  proclamation,  that  June  14  is  ‘‘Flag  Day’’  and 
requested  the  American  flag  be  displayed  on  all  Federal  Government  build-
ings.  The  Congress  also  requested,  in  1966,  that  the  President  annually 
issue  a  proclamation  designating  the  week  in  which  June  14  occurs  as 
‘‘National Flag Week’’ and call upon citizens of the United States to display 
the flag during that week. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  14,  2017,  as  Flag  Day,  and  this  week 
as  National  Flag  Week.  I  direct  the  appropriate  officials  to  display  the 
flag  on  all  Federal  Government  buildings  during  this  week,  and  I  urge 
all  Americans  to  observe  Flag  Day  and  National  Flag  Week  by  displaying 
the  flag.  I  also  encourage  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  with 
pride and all due ceremony those days from Flag Day through Independence 
Day,  set  aside  by  the  Congress  (89  Stat.  211),  as  a  time  to  honor  America, 
to  celebrate  our  heritage  in  public  gatherings  and  activities,  and  to  publicly 
recite  the  Pledge  of  Allegiance  to  the  Flag  of  the  United  States  of  America.

The  President 

Proclamation  9573  of  February  2,  2017 

American  Heart  Month,  2017 

9673 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The death rate from heart disease in the United States has fallen dramatically 
since  the  1960s,  a  significant  public  health  victory.  Despite  this  progress, 
heart  disease  remains  a  leading  cause  of  death  for  both  men  and  women 
in  the  United  States,  and  we  must  reduce  its  toll.  During  American  Heart 
Month,  we  remember  those  who  have  lost  their  lives  to  heart  disease  and 
resolve  to  improve  its  prevention,  detection,  and  treatment.  It  is  a  time 
for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to improving cardiovascular health— 
for ourselves, our families, and our communities. 
Over  the  past  several  decades,  we  have  learned  much  about  factors  that 
contribute  to  heart  disease,  how  to  monitor  those  triggers,  and  ways  to 
treat  them.  We  know  that  individuals  can  live  longer  and  better  lives  by 
refraining  from  tobacco  use,  maintaining  an  optimal  blood  pressure  and 
a  healthy  weight,  eating  a  healthy  diet,  and  exercising  regularly.  Innovative 
companies  continue  to  offer  new  tools  and  online  systems,  giving  people 
more access than ever to information they can use to make informed, health- 
conscious choices. 
Scientific research and evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat heart 
attacks  and  strokes  have  played  an  important  part  in  making  these  strides. 
Developments  in  technology  and  the  discovery  of  early  markers  of  heart 
disease  have  allowed  us  to  diagnose  and  treat  heart  disease  sooner  than 
ever  before.  American  innovators  continue  to  develop  treatments  for  high 
blood pressure and high cholesterol, and our health care providers continue 
to  promote  best  strategies  and  educate  Americans  to  stay  heart  healthy. 
To  highlight  the  importance  of  preventing  heart  disease,  Melania  and  I 
invite  all  Americans  to  wear  red  this  Friday,  February  3,  2017,  to  observe 
National  Wear  Red  Day.  Working  together  on  National  Wear  Red  Day,  and 
throughout  the  year,  we  can  raise  awareness  about  heart  disease  and  make 
our Nation healthier. 
In  acknowledgement  of  the  importance  of  the  ongoing  fight  against  cardio-
vascular  disease,  the  Congress,  by  Joint  Resolution  approved  on  December 
30,  1963,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  101),  has  requested  that  the  President 
issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  February  2017  as  American  Heart  Month, 
and  I  invite  all  Americans  to  participate  in  National  Wear  Red  Day  on 
February 3, 2017. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth 
of  Puerto  Rico,  officials  of  other  areas  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the 
United  States,  and  the  American  people  to  join  me  in  recognizing  and 
reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.

Executive  Order  13771  of  January  30,  2017 

Reducing  Regulation  and  Controlling  Regulatory  Costs 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  including  the  Budget  and  Accounting 
Act  of  1921,  as  amended  (31  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.),  section  1105  of  title 
31,  United  States  Code,  and  section  301  of  title  3,  United  States  Code, 
it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  to  be  prudent 
and  financially  responsible  in  the  expenditure  of  funds,  from  both  public 
and private sources. In addition to the management of the direct expenditure 
of  taxpayer  dollars  through  the  budgeting  process,  it  is  essential  to  manage 
the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures 
required to comply with Federal regulations. Toward that end, it is important 
that  for  every  one  new  regulation  issued,  at  least  two  prior  regulations 
be  identified  for  elimination,  and  that  the  cost  of  planned  regulations  be 
prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process. 
Sec.  2.  Regulatory  Cap  for  Fiscal  Year  2017.  (a)  Unless  prohibited  by  law, 
whenever  an  executive  department  or  agency  (agency)  publicly  proposes 
for  notice  and  comment  or  otherwise  promulgates  a  new  regulation,  it  shall 
identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed. 

(b)  For  fiscal  year  2017,  which  is  in  progress,  the  heads  of  all  agencies 
are  directed  that  the  total  incremental  cost  of  all  new  regulations,  including 
repealed  regulations,  to  be  finalized  this  year  shall  be  no  greater  than  zero, 
unless  otherwise  required  by  law  or  consistent  with  advice  provided  in 
writing  by  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (Director). 
(c)  In  furtherance  of  the  requirement  of  subsection  (a)  of  this  section, 
any  new  incremental  costs  associated  with  new  regulations  shall,  to  the 
extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associ-
ated  with  at  least  two  prior  regulations.  Any  agency  eliminating  existing 
costs  associated  with  prior  regulations  under  this  subsection  shall  do  so 
in  accordance  with  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  and  other  applicable 
law. 

(d)  The  Director  shall  provide  the  heads  of  agencies  with  guidance  on 
the  implementation  of  this  section.  Such  guidance  shall  address,  among 
other  things,  processes  for  standardizing  the  measurement  and  estimation 
of  regulatory  costs;  standards  for  determining  what  qualifies  as  new  and 
offsetting  regulations;  standards  for  determining  the  costs  of  existing  regula-
tions  that  are  considered  for  elimination;  processes  for  accounting  for  costs 
in  different  fiscal  years;  methods  to  oversee  the  issuance  of  rules  with 
costs offset by savings at different times or different agencies; and emergencies 
and other circumstances that might justify individual waivers of the require-
ments  of  this  section.  The  Director  shall  consider  phasing  in  and  updating 
these requirements. 
Sec.  3.  Annual  Regulatory  Cost  Submissions  to  the  Office  of  Management 
and Budget. (a) Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Execu-
tive  Order  12866  of  September  30,  1993,  as  amended,  or  any  successor 
order)  for  fiscal  year  2018,  and  for  each  fiscal  year  thereafter,  the  head 
of  each  agency  shall  identify,  for  each  regulation  that  increases  incremental 
cost,  the  offsetting  regulations  described  in  section  2(c)  of  this  order,  and 
provide  the  agency’s  best  approximation  of  the  total  costs  or  savings  associ-
ated with each new regulation or repealed regulation.

Executive Order 12866, as amended, or any successor order. 

(c)  Unless  otherwise  required  by  law,  no  regulation  shall  be  issued  by

16707 

Proclamation  9581  of  March  31,  2017 

Cancer  Control  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  creativity  and  commitment  of  America’s  incredible  medical  research 
and  healthcare  communities  have  made  the  United  States  the  biomedical 
innovation  capital  of  the  world.  In  particular,  American  innovators  have 
made  ground-breaking  advances  in  cancer  research.  These  innovations  help 
drive the declining rates of cancer mortality. 
Still,  much  work  remains  to  be  done.  Cancer  is  still  the  second-leading 
cause  of  death  in  the  United  States  and  causes  too  much  suffering  for 
too many of our families and communities. 
During  Cancer  Control  Month,  we  honor  the  memory  of  loved  ones  lost 
to  cancer  and  we  celebrate  our  cancer  survivors.  We  recommit  ourselves 
to developing cures for those currently battling this disease across the country 
and  to  educating  people  on  the  many  ways  they  can  prevent  cancer  and 
take care of those who have fallen ill. 
Our  Nation  is  committed  to  winning  the  fight  against  cancer.  Throughout 
April, we promote methods to combat cancer and we recognize the thousands 
of medical professionals, public health advocates, scientific researchers, inno-
vative  companies,  and  family  members  and  friends  who  treat,  find  cures 
for, and support those suffering from all forms of cancer. 
My  Administration  will  continue  to  work  with  the  Congress  to  implement 
the  21st  Century  Cures  Act  and  clear  the  way  for  enormous  breakthroughs 
in  medical  science.  Cutting-edge  research  can  transform  cancer  treatment, 
so  that  it  is  more  effective,  less  toxic,  and  less  debilitating.  Together,  we 
will  make  possible  the  medical  advances  necessary  to  prevent,  treat,  and 
defeat this disease. 
Experts  believe  that  nearly  half  of  the  most  common  cancers  can  be  pre-
vented. Americans can reduce their risk of developing cancer through healthy 
eating  habits,  regular  physical  activity,  and  avoiding  tobacco  and  excessive 
alcohol consumption. Regular physicals and cancer screenings and awareness 
of family medical histories are also critical to preventing cancers and helping 
those  who  fall  victim  to  cancer  discover  it  at  earlier,  more  treatable  stages. 
Because of the toll cancer imposes on our citizens, families, and communities, 
as  well  as  the  importance  of  promoting  prevention  and  early  detection, 
my  Administration  wholeheartedly  concurs  in  the  request  of  the  Congress, 
that dates back to 1938, to declare April as ‘‘Cancer Control Month.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as Cancer 
Control  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  speak  with 
their doctors and healthcare providers to learn more about preventive meas-
ures  that  can  save  lives.  I  encourage  citizens,  government  agencies,  private 
businesses,  nonprofit  organizations,  the  media,  and  other  interested  groups 
to  increase  awareness  of  what  Americans  can  do  to  prevent  and  control 
cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials 
of  other  areas  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  to  join  me 
in recognizing Cancer Control Month.

Proclamation  9587  of  April  3,  2017 

National  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Crime  Victims’  Rights  Week,  we  stand  with  crime  victims 
and  their  families,  we  renew  our  commitment  to  safeguarding  our  commu-
nities  from  crime,  and  we  recognize  those  who  devote  their  lives  to  sup-
porting and empowering victims and survivors. 
Crime and violence rob people of their rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of  happiness.  We  must  focus  on  the  plight  of  crime  victims  and  search 
for  effective  solutions.  For  too  long,  communities  across  this  Nation  have 
suffered  from  murder  rates  that  are  far  too  high.  Gang-related  shootings 
plague our major cities, while violence continues to afflict towns both small 
and large. 
The  physical,  mental,  and  emotional  scars  borne  by  crime  victims  are  often 
coupled with serious financial implications. In 1984, President Reagan signed 
the  Victims  of  Crime  Act,  which  established  the  Crime  Victims  Fund.  This 
fund  provides  compensation  for  victims  of  crime  for  crime-related  expenses 
such  as  medical  payments,  counseling,  lost  wages,  and  funeral  and  burial 
costs;  supports  victims’  service  programs  such  as  domestic  violence  shelters 
and  rape  crisis  centers;  and  builds  capacity  to  improve  responsiveness  to 
the  needs  of  crime  victims.  The  Crime  Victims  Fund  receives  billions  of 
dollars  each  year  from,  among  other  sources,  certain  criminal  fines  and 
penalties paid by convicted Federal offenders, which helps prevent American 
taxpayers  from  shouldering  the  burdens  of  reparations.  While  this  fund 
cannot  completely  undo  the  damage  caused  by  crime,  it  can  at  least  ease 
the  monetary  burden  felt  by  victims  and  their  families  in  the  midst  of 
grief. 
As  a  society,  we  must  continue  to  support  those  who  have  endured  the 
fallout  from  crime.  My  Administration  is  developing  an  office  to  assist 
victims of crimes committed by criminal aliens. The Victims Of Immigration 
Crime  Engagement  (VOICE),  within  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security, 
will  work  to  serve  the  victims  of  open  borders  policies—which  will  no 
longer  form  the  basis  of  our  immigration  system.  These  victims  will  not 
be  ignored  by  the  media  or  silenced  by  special  interests  any  longer.  We 
will  restore  law  and  order  and  protect  our  citizens  from  this  undue  harm. 
During  National  Crime  Victims’  Week,  we  renew  our  commitment  to  pro-
tecting all victims of crime, vindicating their rights, alleviating their burdens, 
and preventing future crime. We will assist our law enforcement community 
in  bringing  justice  to  victims  and  to  their  communities.  My  Administration 
is resolved to uphold this fundamental purpose of the United States Govern-
ment—preserving security for all Americans. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  2  through 
April 8, 2017, as National Crime Victims’ Rights Week. I urge all Americans, 
families,  law  enforcement,  community  and  faith-based  organizations,  and 
private organizations to work together to support victims of crime and protect 
their rights.

Proclamation  9630  of  August  20,  2017 

National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve  Week, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Throughout  our  Nation’s  history,  Americans  from  all  walks  of  life  have 
made  tremendous  sacrifices  in  defense  of  our  freedom.  Today,  more  than 
one  million  citizen  soldiers,  sailors,  airmen,  marines,  and  coastguardsmen 
continue  this  proud  legacy  as  members  of  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve. 
During  National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve  Week,  we 
express  our  gratitude  to  the  employers  and  communities  who  support  those 
brave men and women. 
Employer  support  for  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve  is  important  to  our 
ability  to  sustain  an  all-volunteer  force.  Employers  play  a  vital  role  in 
easing  the  transitions  our  national  guardsmen  and  reservists  must  make 
from  civilian  life  to  military  service  and  back  again.  Whether  they  are 
participating  in  weekend  training  in  support  of  readiness  or  deploying  in 
response to a crisis at home and abroad, our national guardsmen and reserv-
ists  are  more  effective  when  they  have  the  support  of  civilian  employers. 
Our  Nation  salutes  our  employers  and  business  leaders  who,  often  at  their 
own  expense,  back  their  employees  who  serve  in  the  National  Guard  and 
Reserve.  As  President,  I  will  continue  to  focus  on  providing  our  men  and 
women  in  uniform  and  their  families  with  access  to  the  services,  benefits, 
and care they so deserve. I encourage all Americans to join with our employ-
ers  in  facilitating  the  service  our  national  guardsmen  and  reservists  provide 
to  our  Nation  and  honoring  the  sacrifices  they  make  in  defense  of  our 
security. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  August  20  through 
August  26,  2017,  as  National  Employer  Support  of  the  Guard  and  Reserve 
Week.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  join  me  in  expressing  our  heartfelt 
thanks  to  the  civilian  employers  who  provide  critical  support  to  the  men 
and  women  of  the  National  Guard  and  Reserve.  I  also  call  on  State  and 
local officials, private organizations, and all military commanders to observe 
this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9611  of  May  15,  2017 

Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  Police  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  Police  Week,  we  honor  the  men 
and  women  of  law  enforcement  who  have  been  killed  or  disabled  in  the 
course  of  serving  our  communities.  Police  officers  are  the  thin  blue  line 
whose  sacrifices  protect  and  serve  us  every  day,  and  we  pledge  to  support 
them as they risk their lives to safeguard ours. 
Last  year,  118  officers  died  in  the  line  of  duty,  and  of  those,  66  were 
victims  of  malicious  attacks.  These  attacks  increased  by  nearly  40  percent 
from  2015.  This  must  end.  That  is  why  one  of  my  first  actions  was  to 
direct  the  Department  of  Justice  to  develop  a  strategy  to  better  prevent 
and  prosecute  crimes  of  violence  against  our  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and 
local law enforcement officers. 
In  addition,  my  Administration  will  continue  to  further  the  efforts  of  the 
Department  of  Justice  to  improve  the  lives  of  law  enforcement  officers  and 
their  families.  This  includes  supporting  the  Officer  Safety  and  Wellness 
Group,  which  improves  officer  safety  on  the  job,  and  accelerating  the  proc-
essing of benefits through the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program, which 
provides vital resources to the families of fallen officers. 
Our  liberties  depend  on  the  rule  of  law,  and  that  means  supporting  the 
incredible  men  and  women  of  law  enforcement.  By  a  joint  resolution  ap-
proved  October  1,  1962,  as  amended  (76  Stat.  676),  and  by  Public  Law 
103–322,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  136  and  137),  the  President  has  been 
authorized and requested to designate May 15 of each year as ‘‘Peace Officers 
Memorial Day’’ and the week in which it falls as ‘‘Police Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  15,  2017,  as  Peace  Officers  Memorial 
Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as Police Week. In humble apprecia-
tion  of  our  hard-working  law  enforcement  officers,  Melania  and  I  will  light 
the  White  House  in  blue  on  May  15.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe 
Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  Police  Week  with  appropriate  ceremonies 
and  activities.  I  also  call  on  the  Governors  of  the  States  and  Territories 
and  officials  of  other  areas  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States, 
to  direct  that  the  flag  be  flown  at  half-staff  on  Peace  Officers  Memorial 
Day.  I  further  encourage  all  Americans  to  display  the  flag  at  half-staff  from 
their homes and businesses on that day.

Proclamation  9624  of  June  16,  2017 

Father’s  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Father’s  Day  is  a  special  occasion  that  reminds  us  to  pause  and  thank 
the men in our lives who have taken on the responsibility of raising children. 
As  sons  and  daughters,  we  recognize  the  love  they  have  given  and  the 
sacrifices  they  have  made,  and  we  celebrate  the  indispensable  role  fathers 
play in our lives and communities. 
Fathers  have  the  ability  and  responsibility  to  instill  in  us  core  values  we 
carry  into  adulthood.  The  examples  they  set  and  the  lessons  they  impart 
about  hard  work,  dedication  to  family,  faith  in  God,  and  believing  in  our-
selves  establish  the  moral  foundation  for  success  that  allows  us  to  live 
up  to  our  full  potential.  We  remember  those  fatherly  moments  big  and 
small—throwing  a  baseball,  writing  an  essay,  driving  a  car,  walking  down 
the  aisle—that  have  shaped  us,  and  we  thank  our  dads  for  being  there 
with a helping hand and an open heart. 
Day  in  and  day  out,  fathers  put  their  children  first,  creating  loving  and 
supportive  environments.  Whether  by  birth,  adoption,  or  foster  care,  today 
we  honor  the  incredible  fathers  in  our  lives  for  all  they  have  done  and 
continue  to  do  for  us.  Fathers  inspire  us  to  better  ourselves  and  to  be 
men and women of outstanding character. We recommit ourselves as individ-
uals,  families,  and  communities  to  promoting  and  supporting  fatherhood, 
and  take  this  day  to  express  our  love  and  appreciation  for  fathers  across 
our country. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  in  accordance  with  a  joint  resolution  of  the  Congress  approved 
April  24,  1972,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  109),  do  hereby  proclaim  June  18, 
2017, as Father’s Day. I call on United States Government officials to display 
the  flag  of  the  United  States  on  all  Government  buildings  on  Father’s  Day 
and  invite  State  and  local  governments  and  the  people  of  the  United  States 
to observe Father’s Day with appropriate ceremonies.

Proclamation  9638  of  September  13,  2017 

National  POW/MIA  Recognition  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Americans are blessed with many freedoms thanks to the hard-earned battle 
victories  and  tremendous  sacrifices  of  our  military  men  and  women.  The 
members  of  our  Armed  Forces  shine  a  light  of  freedom  throughout  the 
world,  and  as  we  celebrate  our  returning  heroes,  we  also  remember  our 
heroes  who  never  returned  home.  On  National  POW/MIA  Recognition  Day, 
our  Nation  recognizes  all  American  prisoners  of  war  and  service  members 
missing  in  action  who  have  valiantly  honored  their  commitment  to  this 
great country. 
It  is  our  sacred  obligation  to  pay  tribute  to  the  thousands  of  men  and 
women  of  our  Armed  Forces  who  have  been  imprisoned  while  serving 
in  conflicts  and  who  have  yet  to  return  to  American  soil.  We  reflect  on 
the  brave  Americans  who,  while  guarding  our  freedom  and  our  way  of 
life,  spent  years  of  their  youth  imprisoned  in  distant  lands.  They  paid 
an  enormous  price  and  remained  dedicated  to  our  sacred  principles,  even 
while under extreme duress. 
We  do  not  leave  our  fellow  man  or  woman  behind,  and  we  do  not  rest 
until  our  mission  is  complete.  For  more  than  three  decades,  our  country 
has  conducted  investigation  and  recovery  operations  in  Southeast  Asia  with 
the  help  of  the  governments  of  Vietnam,  Laos,  and  Cambodia.  Whether 
in  Southeast  Asia,  or  in  South  Korea,  Europe,  the  South  Pacific,  and  in 
all  other  corners  of  the  globe,  we  are  committed  to  this  most  honorable 
mission  of  fully  accounting  for  our  missing  personnel.  We  are  encouraged 
by  the  progress  made,  but  know  our  mission  is  ongoing  until  every  Soldier, 
Sailor,  Airman,  Coast  Guardsman,  and  Marine  missing  in  the  line  of  duty 
is accounted for. 
As  Commander  in  Chief,  it  is  my  solemn  duty  to  keep  all  Americans  safe. 
I  will  never  forget  our  heroes  held  prisoner  or  who  have  gone  missing 
in  action  while  serving  their  country.  Today,  we  recognize  not  just  the 
tremendous sacrifices of our service members, but also those of their families 
who  still  seek  answers.  We  are  steadfastly  committed  to  bringing  solace 
to  those  who  wait  for  the  fullest  possible  accounting  of  their  loved  ones. 
On September 15, 2017, the stark black and white banner symbolizing Amer-
ica’s  Missing  in  Action  and  Prisoners  of  War  will  be  flown  over  the  White 
House;  the  United  States  Capitol;  the  Departments  of  State,  Defense,  and 
Veterans  Affairs;  the  Selective  Service  System  Headquarters;  the  World  War 
II  Memorial;  the  Korean  War  Veterans  Memorial;  the  Vietnam  Veterans  Me-
morial;  United  States  post  offices;  national  cemeteries;  and  other  locations 
across our country. We raise this flag as a solemn reminder of our obligation 
to always remember the sacrifices made to defend our Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  15,  2017, 
as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I call upon the people of the United 
States  to  join  me  in  saluting  all  American  POWs  and  those  missing  in 
action  who  valiantly  served  our  country.  I  call  upon  Federal,  State,  and

Proclamation  9628  of  July  25,  2017 

Anniversary  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  the  anniversary  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA),  we  cele-
brate the landmark legislation that marks our Nation’s commitment to ending 
discrimination  against  people  with  disabilities.  The  ADA’s  recognition  of 
the  inherent  dignity  of  disabled  persons  solidified  America’s  status  as  the 
world leader in protecting fundamental rights. Today, we pay special respect 
to  the  contributions  of  the  more  than  56  million  Americans  living  with 
disabilities,  and  we  look  forward  to  further  advancing  accessibility  for  all 
those who need it. 
President  George  H.W.  Bush  signed  the  ADA  on  July  26,  1990,  and  for 
27  years  it  has  been  instrumental  in  protecting  the  rights  and  liberties 
of people with disabilities and strengthening their access to everyday Amer-
ican  life.  Disabilities  are  an  unavoidable  part  of  the  human  experience— 
veterans  injured  in  service  to  their  Nation,  survivors  of  accidents  and  ill-
nesses,  children  born  with  disabilities,  and  our  elderly.  Since  its  inception, 
the  ADA  has  helped  empower  people  living  with  disabilities  by  ensuring 
they  have  fair  and  just  access  to  employment,  government  services,  public 
accommodations, commercial facilities, and public transportation. 
Americans  are  justifiably  proud  of  the  ADA  and  its  accomplishments,  but 
more  can  be  done  to  protect  the  rights  and  dignity  of  Americans  living 
with  disabilities.  Disabled  Americans  in  the  workforce  already  contribute 
substantially  to  our  Nation’s  productivity  and  prosperity.  We  must  continue 
to empower them by breaking down obstacles that prevent their full participa-
tion  in  the  public  and  economic  affairs  of  our  Nation.  In  addition,  my 
Administration  will  encourage  American  ingenuity  and  technological  ad-
vancements in medicine and science, which will give millions of Americans 
with  disabilities  opportunities  to  work,  engage  in  commerce,  and  connect 
with others in ways we could not have imagined 27 years ago. 
On  the  anniversary  of  the  ADA,  we  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  fostering 
an  environment  that  provides  all  Americans  with  the  opportunity  to  pursue 
their  American  dream.  Let  us  all  take  this  time  to  refocus  our  efforts  to 
support our fellow Americans and help them succeed, no matter the obstacles 
they may face. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  July  26,  2017,  as 
a  day  in  celebration  of  the  27th  Anniversary  of  the  Americans  with  Disabil-
ities  Act.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate 
ceremonies and activities that celebrate the contributions of Americans with 
disabilities  and  to  renew  our  commitment  to  achieving  the  promise  of  our 
freedom for all Americans.

Proclamation  9570  of  January  20,  2017 

National  Day  of  Patriotic  Devotion 

8349 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

A  new  national  pride  stirs  the  American  soul  and  inspires  the  American 
heart. We are one people, united by a common destiny and a shared purpose. 

Freedom  is  the  birthright  of  all  Americans,  and  to  preserve  that  freedom 
we must maintain faith in our sacred values and heritage. 

Our  Constitution  is  written  on  parchment,  but  it  lives  in  the  hearts  of 
the  American  people.  There  is  no  freedom  where  the  people  do  not  believe 
in  it;  no  law  where  the  people  do  not  follow  it;  and  no  peace  where 
the people do not pray for it. 

There  are  no  greater  people  than  the  American  citizenry,  and  as  long  as 
we believe in ourselves, and our country, there is nothing we cannot accom-
plish. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  20,  2017, 
as  National  Day  of  Patriotic  Devotion,  in  order  to  strengthen  our  bonds 
to  each  other  and  to  our  country—and  to  renew  the  duties  of  Government 
to the people. 

IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twentieth  day 
of  January,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

National  Day  of  Prayer,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

We  come  together  on  our  National  Day  of  Prayer  as  one  Nation,  under 
God,  to  show  gratitude  for  our  many  blessings,  to  give  thanks  for  His 
providence,  and  to  ask  for  His  continued  wisdom,  strength,  and  protection 
as we chart a course for the future. We are united in prayer, each according 
to  our  own  faith  and  tradition,  and  we  believe  that  in  America,  people 
of  all  faiths,  creeds,  and  religions  must  be  free  to  exercise  their  natural 
right to worship according to their consciences. 

We  are  also  reminded  and  reaffirm  that  all  human  beings  have  the  right, 
not only to pray and worship according to their consciences, but to practice 
their  faith  in  their  homes,  schools,  charities,  and  businesses—in  private 
and  in  the  public  square—free  from  government  coercion,  discrimination, 
or  persecution.  Religion  is  not  merely  an  intellectual  exercise,  but  also 
a  practical  one  that  demands  action  in  the  world.  Even  the  many  prisoners 
around  the  world  who  are  persecuted  for  their  faith  can  pray  privately 
in  their  cells.  But  our  Constitution  demands  more:  the  freedom  to  practice 
one’s faith publicly. 

The  religious  liberty  guaranteed  by  the  Constitution  is  not  a  favor  from 
the  government,  but  a  natural  right  bestowed  by  God.  Our  Constitution 
and  our  laws  that  protect  religious  freedom  merely  recognize  the  right  that 
all  people  have  by  virtue  of  their  humanity.  As  Thomas  Jefferson  wisely 
questioned:  ‘‘can  the  liberties  of  a  nation  be  thought  secure  when  we  have 
removed  their  only  firm  basis,  a  conviction  in  the  minds  of  the  people 
that these liberties are the gift of God?’’ 

In  1789,  President  George  Washington  proclaimed  a  day  of  public  thanks-
giving and prayer, calling upon Americans to ‘‘unite in most humbly offering 
our  prayers  and  supplications  to  the  great  Lord  and  Ruler  of  Nations.’’ 
In  1988,  the  Congress,  by  Public  Law  100–307,  called  on  the  President 
to  issue  each  year  a  proclamation  designating  the  first  Thursday  in  May 
as  a  ‘‘National  Day  of  Prayer.’’  On  this  National  Day  of  Prayer,  the  right 
to  pray  freely  and  live  according  to  one’s  faith  is  under  threat  around 
the world from coercive governments and terrorist organizations. We therefore 
pray  especially  for  the  many  people  around  the  world  who  are  persecuted 
for  their  beliefs  and  deprived  of  their  fundamental  liberty  to  live  according 
to  their  conscience.  We  pray  for  the  triumph  of  freedom  over  oppression, 
and for God’s love and mercy over evil. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May 
4,  2017,  as  a  National  Day  of  Prayer.  I  invite  the  citizens  of  our  Nation 
to pray, in accordance with their own faiths and consciences, in thanksgiving 
for  the  freedoms  and  blessings  we  have  received,  and  for  God’s  guidance 
and continued protection as we meet the challenges before us.

Proclamation  9579  of  March  21,  2017 

National  Agriculture  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
America’s farmers and ranchers help feed the world, fuel our Nation’s econ-
omy,  and  lead  global  markets  in  output  and  productivity.  The  efficiency 
of American agriculture has provided this country with abundance our ances-
tors could not have imagined. 
The agriculture sector of the United States is endlessly innovative. It continu-
ously  builds  on  its  centuries  of  progress  through  advances  in  science,  re-
search,  technology,  safety,  production,  and  marketing  to  meet  the  demands 
of  changing  consumer  needs  and  complex  world  markets.  The  agriculture 
sector  provides  jobs  across  our  Nation,  not  just  for  farmers  and  ranchers, 
but  for  foresters,  scientists,  processors,  shippers,  firefighters,  police,  and 
retailers. 
American  agriculture  is  the  largest  positive  contributor  to  our  Nation’s  net 
trade balance, generating 10 percent of our exports and millions of American 
jobs.  America’s  farmers  and  ranchers  provide  a  safe  and  plentiful  domestic 
food supply, which is vital to our national security. Moreover, they safeguard 
our  sustainable  resource  base  for  future  generations.  As  my  Administration 
fights  for  better  trade  deals,  agriculture  will  be  an  important  consideration 
so  that  its  significant  contributions  will  only  increase  in  the  years  ahead. 
American  farmers  and  ranchers  are  the  heart  and  soul  of  America  and 
they  represent  the  determined,  self-reliant  character  of  our  Nation.  We  are 
proud  of  American  agriculture  and  we  recognize  agriculture’s  critical  role 
to our Nation’s bright future. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  21,  2017, 
as  National  Agriculture  Day.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  observe  this 
day  by  recognizing  the  preeminent  role  that  agriculture  plays  in  Americans’ 
daily life, acknowledging agriculture’s continuing importance to our country’s 
economy,  and  expressing  our  deep  appreciation  of  farmers  and  ranchers 
across the Nation.

Proclamation  9619  of  May  31,  2017 

Great  Outdoors  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
With  June  comes  the  summer  sun,  longer  days,  and  warmer  weather— 
the  perfect  opportunity  to  enjoy  the  great  outdoors.  During  Great  Outdoors 
Month, we encourage all Americans to experience the beauty and adventure 
of  our  Nation’s  lakes,  mountains,  and  forests,  and  even  of  their  own  back-
yards. 
Each  of  our  States  and  territories  provides  endless  opportunities  to  enjoy 
the  great  outdoors.  Americans  can  go  fishing  in  Eleven  Mile  State  Park 
in  Colorado,  camp  on  the  bluffs  of  Perrot  State  Park  in  Wisconsin,  and 
bike  along  the  Sable  River  in  Ludington  State  Park  in  Michigan.  These 
lands  and  waters  are  also  home  to  cultural  and  historic  sites  that  inspire 
our  love  of  country  and  serve  as  important  touchstones  for  who  we  are 
as Americans. 
Whether  your  great  outdoors  means  a  community  park,  a  state  reservoir, 
a  national  forest,  or  a  backyard  campout,  we  must  cherish  our  outdoor 
spaces and work to preserve them for generations. This is why, as President, 
I  am  working  to  bring  leaders  throughout  the  country  together  to  improve 
the  management  of  our  vitally  important  public  lands,  especially  through 
public-private partnerships to help clear the backlog of deferred maintenance. 
I  urge  all  Americans  to  set  aside  time  during  the  month  of  June  to  visit 
our  great  outdoors  and  experience  America’s  natural  and  cultural  history. 
This month in particular, we celebrate our Nation’s remarkable natural herit-
age and express our gratitude to those who help preserve our natural habitat 
for generations of Americans to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  2017  as  Great 
Outdoors  Month.  I  urge  all  Americans  to  explore  the  great  outdoors  while 
acting as stewards of our lands and waters.

Proclamation  9575  of  March  1,  2017 

Irish-American  Heritage  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Irish  Americans  have  made  an  indelible  mark  on  the  United  States.  From 
Dublin,  California,  to  Limerick,  Maine,  from  Emerald  Isle,  North  Carolina, 
to Shamrock, Texas, we are reminded of the more than 35 million Americans 
of  Irish  descent  who  contribute  every  day  to  all  facets  of  life  in  the  United 
States.  Over  generations,  millions  of  Irish  have  crossed  the  ocean  in  search 
of  the  American  Dream,  and  their  contributions  continue  to  enrich  our 
country today. 
From  our  four  Irish-born  Founding  Fathers  to  Thomas  Francis  Meagher, 
the  Irish  revolutionary  who  became  an  American  hero  after  leading  the 
Irish Brigade during the Civil War, Irish immigrants have shaped our history 
in  enduring  ways.  Throughout  the  centuries,  hard-working  Irish  Americans 
have  contributed  to  America’s  innovation  and  prosperity—tilling  the  farms 
of Appalachia, working the looms of New England textile mills, and building 
transcontinental railroads—often overcoming poverty and discrimination and 
inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entre-
preneurial spirit in the process. From these early beginnings rose generations 
of  Irish  Americans  who  continue  to  lead  our  cities,  drive  our  economy, 
and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own. 
American  culture  carries  an  unmistakably  Irish-American  imprint.  Our  lit-
erature,  cinema,  music,  dance,  sports,  and  visual  arts  are  filled  with  the 
names and influence of great Irish Americans. 
Irish Americans should be proud of the deep cultural, historical, and familial 
ties that have contributed to the strength of our vibrant transatlantic relation-
ship  with  Ireland.  As  we  honor  the  past  during  Irish-American  Heritage 
Month,  we  also  celebrate  a  bright  future  of  friendship  and  cooperation 
for generations to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2017  as 
Irish-American  Heritage  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  celebrate  the 
achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appro-
priate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9612  of  May  19,  2017 

Emergency  Medical  Services  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  Emergency  Medical  Services  (EMS)  Week,  we  express  our  gratitude 
for  the  hundreds  of  thousands  of  skilled  personnel  who  help  save  lives 
in  communities  across  the  United  States  each  year.  Through  the  hard  work 
and  dedication  of  these  career  and  volunteer  first  responders,  Americans 
receive  the  finest  emergency  medical  treatment  in  their  most  vulnerable 
moments.  We  also  honor  those  EMS  providers  who  have  made  the  ultimate 
sacrifice and given their lives in the line of duty. 
Day  or  night,  in  every  city,  suburb,  rural  community,  or  wilderness  area, 
our Nation relies upon EMS providers to respond to every kind of emergency 
situation  to  save  lives  and  reduce  suffering.  In  January,  when  more  than 
70  tornadoes  touched  down  in  Georgia  and  Mississippi,  injuring  many, 
EMS  responders  were  there  to  help.  In  March,  when  wildfires  threatened 
Kansas,  Colorado,  Oklahoma,  and  Texas,  taking  lives  and  forcing  thousands 
from  their  homes,  our  EMS  personnel  were  there  providing  urgent  medical 
care  and  patient  transportation.  Last  month,  when  flooding  and  tornadoes 
ravaged  Missouri,  Arkansas,  and  Texas,  EMS  personnel  once  more  came 
to  their  neighbors’  aid.  Whether  they  are  assisting  during  natural  disasters 
or providing lifesaving care after car accidents, heart attacks, sports injuries, 
or  violent  crime,  EMS  personnel  respond  to  tens  of  millions  of  requests 
for  help  each  year  in  our  country.  We  rest  easier  knowing  that  they  stand 
ready to answer the call. 
Over  the  past  50  years,  our  Nation’s  EMS  system  has  evolved  with  ever- 
developing  medical,  transportation,  and  communications  technologies  to 
meet  the  changing  needs  of  our  communities.  The  EMS  Agenda  2050 
project—a joint effort by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 
the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland 
Security,  and  the  EMS  community—will  help  develop  a  vision  for  meeting 
our  communities’  future  emergency  medical  services  needs  and  improve 
the health of all Americans. We commend these efforts to develop innovative 
new  treatments,  advance  and  adapt  medical  skills,  establish  stronger  profes-
sional  standards,  and  promote  public  education  and  health.  This  week, 
we thank our EMS professionals for their sustained commitment to excellence 
and  dedication  to  service,  and  share  our  hopes  for  a  bright  future  that 
will make us all safer and healthier. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Donald  J.  Trump,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  21  through 
May 27, 2017, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Ameri-
cans to observe this occasion by showing their support for local EMS profes-
sionals through appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation  9653  of  October  6,  2017 

Fire  Prevention  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  Fire  Prevention  Week,  we  recognize  the  dangers  posed  by  fires  and 
emphasize the importance of fire prevention and preparation. We also honor 
our  Nation’s  brave  firefighters  who  have  lost  their  lives  in  the  line  of 
duty  and  their  families,  and  those  firefighters  who  continue  to  put  their 
lives on the line each day. 
Each  year,  an  average  1.4  million  fires  burn  in  the  United  States.  In  2015, 
fires  caused  approximately  3,360  deaths  and  15,700  injuries.  This  year, 
the  American  West  has  especially  suffered,  as  wildfires  have  raged  from 
California to Oregon and Montana. These fires have already consumed more 
than 8 million acres and destroyed more than 650 homes and other structures. 
All  of  this  destruction  can  be  sparked  by  a  single  careless  act.  We  must 
remain  vigilant  whenever  we  are  around  fire.  By  taking  the  appropriate 
precautions,  we  can  prevent  fires,  save  lives,  and  protect  property  and 
the  environment.  In  particular,  we  should  always  mind  dishes  on  the 
stovetop,  carefully  contain  and  completely  extinguish  campfires,  take  care 
to handle fireworks away from flammable materials, and ensure that cigarettes 
are handled appropriately and discarded after use. 
When  a  fire  breaks  out,  every  second  counts.  A  working  smoke  alarm  can 
buy  the  few  extra  moments  necessary  to  save  a  life.  A  well-conceived  and 
regularly  practiced  plan  can  help  ensure  a  safe  and  orderly  fire  escape 
for  families.  All  Americans  should  create  a  fire  escape  plan  and  practice 
it  yearly  with  their  families.  We  must  make  sure  to  teach  our  children 
how  to  escape  on  their  own  and  make  special  plans  for  family  members 
with limited mobility. The National Fire Protection Association’s Every Sec-
ond  Counts:  Plan  Two  Ways  Out  campaign  can  help  your  family  prepare 
for home fires. 
As  we  observe  Fire  Prevention  Week,  we  pray  for  the  Federal,  State,  local, 
and  tribal  responders  battling  the  wildfires  in  the  West  and  around  the 
country  and  for  all  those  who  have  lost  their  homes  to  fires.  We  recommit 
ourselves  to  preventing  fire-related  disasters  by,  among  other  things,  staying 
current  with  the  latest  fire-prevention  techniques  and  raising  awareness 
about fire-safety practices. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  8  through 
October  14,  2017,  as  Fire  Prevention  Week.  On  Sunday,  October  8,  2017, 
in  accordance  with  Public  Law  107–51,  the  flag  of  the  United  States  will 
be flown at half-staff at all Federal office buildings in honor of the National 
Fallen  Firefighters  Memorial  Service.  I  call  on  all  Americans  to  participate 
in this observance with appropriate programs and activities and by renewing 
their efforts to prevent fires and their tragic consequences.

Proclamation  9640  of  September  15,  2017 

National  Farm  Safety  and  Health  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  the  fall  harvest  begins,  we  reflect  on  the  vital  contributions  of  hard- 
working American farmers, ranchers, and foresters, and we commit to ensur-
ing  their  health  and  their  safety.  During  National  Farm  Safety  and  Health 
Week,  we  recognize  the  men  and  women  of  our  great  Nation  who  work 
the  land,  often  times  at  their  own  risk,  to  supply  the  United  States  and 
the  world  with  essential  products  while  creating  jobs,  supporting  the  econ-
omy, and protecting our environment and natural resources for future genera-
tions. 
Farmers,  ranchers,  foresters,  and  their  families  play  critical  roles  in  meeting 
our  Nation’s  needs  for  food,  fiber,  forestry,  fuel,  and  jobs.  Each  day,  they 
perform  a  range  of  physically  demanding  and  potentially  dangerous  tasks. 
These tasks often involve long hours and are performed in high-risk settings, 
whether  working  in  confined  storage  buildings,  operating  heavy  machinery, 
or  handling  hazardous  chemicals,  sometimes  in  harsh  weather  conditions. 
According  to  the  Department  of  Labor,  agriculture  has  the  highest  fatality 
rate  of  any  industry  sector  in  America,  and  reported  570  fatalities  in  2015. 
These  fatalities  frequently  result  from  transportation  incidents  and  the  dan-
gers  of  working  with  heavy  machinery.  As  the  fortunate  beneficiaries  of 
these  workers’  long  hours  of  physically  demanding  and  dangerous  labor, 
it  is  incumbent  upon  us  all  to  be  mindful  of  the  hazards  of  this  industry. 
To  eliminate  or  minimize  the  risks,  we  must  emphasize  ‘‘safety  first’’  and 
support comprehensive farm-safety education and training initiatives. 
American  farmers,  ranchers,  and  foresters  uphold  values  at  the  heart  of 
the  American  character,  and  as  such,  it  is  our  duty  to  protect  and  promote 
their  safety  and  health.  This  week  we  pay  tribute  to  those  who  earn  their 
living  from  the  land  and  honor  their  resolute  work  ethic,  steadfast  concern 
for others, and a strong sense of community. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through 
September  23,  2017,  as  National  Farm  Safety  and  Health  Week.  I  call  upon 
the  people  of  the  United  States,  including  America’s  farmers  and  ranchers 
and agriculture-related institutions, organizations, and businesses, to reaffirm 
their  dedication  to  farm  safety  and  health.  I  also  urge  all  Americans  to 
honor our agricultural heritage and to express their appreciation and gratitude 
to  our  farmers,  ranchers,  and  foresters  for  their  important  contributions 
and tireless service to our Nation.

Notice  of  July  19,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Transnational  Criminal  Organizations 

On July 24, 2011, by Executive Order 13581, the President declared a national 
emergency  with  respect  to  transnational  criminal  organizations  pursuant 
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706) 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign policy, and economy of the United States constituted by the activities 
of significant transnational criminal organizations. 
Significant transnational criminal organizations continue to threaten the safe-
ty  of  the  United  States  and  its  citizens  through  the  scope  and  gravity  of 
their  actions.  Such  organizations  derive  revenue  through  widespread  illegal 
conduct  and  overwhelmingly  demonstrate  a  blatant  disregard  for  human 
life  through  acts  of  violence  and  abuse.  These  organizations  often  facilitate 
and  aggravate  violent  civil  conflicts  and  increasingly  facilitate  the  activities 
of  other  dangerous  persons.  As  the  sophistication  of  these  organizations 
increases, they pose an increasing threat to the United States. 
The  activities  of  significant  transnational  criminal  organizations  continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national 
emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13581  of  July  24,  2011,  and  the 
measures  adopted  on  that  date  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue 
in effect beyond July 24, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for 
1 year the national emergency with respect to transnational criminal organiza-
tions declared in Executive Order 13581. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9609  of  May  12,  2017 

Mother’s  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Mother’s  Day  is  a  special  celebration  in  America.  It  is  an  occasion  to  thank 
our  mothers  for  the  life  and  love  they  have  given  us  and  to  emphasize 
our  affection  for  them,  affection  they  deserve  every  day  of  the  year.  But 
it  is  also  an  opportunity  to  honor  mothers  across  our  Nation  and  celebrate 
motherhood as a pillar of our country’s stability and success. 
Our  deep  appreciation  for  the  strength  and  spirit  of  mothers  and  their 
resolve to do what is right for their children and families cannot be overstated. 
They  are  often  the  first  to  lend  a  hand  during  hard  times  and  the  first 
to  celebrate  our  proudest  victories.  The  boundless  energy  of  our  mothers 
inspires  us  to  be  people  of  action,  people  who  strive  relentlessly  toward 
our  goals.  Above  all,  they  teach  us  the  power  and  joy  of  unconditional 
love. 
Today  and  every  day,  we  honor  the  incredible  women  whose  influence 
on the world is beyond measure. They brighten America’s future by shaping 
the  character  of  each  new  generation.  They  lead  us  through  our  deepest 
lessons about perseverance and hard work, preparing us for life’s responsibil-
ities.  Whether  by  birth,  adoption,  or  foster  care,  our  Nation’s  mothers  give 
selflessly  of  themselves  for  the  well-being  of  the  lives  and  futures  of  others. 
We humbly thank them for this greatest gift. 
In  recognition  of  the  contributions  of  mothers  to  American  families  and 
to  our  Nation,  the  Congress,  by  joint  resolution  approved  May  8,  1914 
(38  Stat.  770),  has  designated  the  second  Sunday  in  May  each  year  as 
Mother’s  Day  and  requested  the  President  to  call  for  its  appropriate  observ-
ance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of America, do hereby proclaim May 14, 2017, as Mother’s Day. I encourage 
all Americans to express their love and respect for their mothers or beloved 
mother  figures,  whether  with  us  in  person  or  in  spirit,  and  to  reflect  on 
the importance of motherhood to the prosperity of our families, communities, 
and Nation.

Proclamation  9636  of  September  8,  2017 

Patriot  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Patriot  Day,  we  honor  the  nearly  3,000  innocent  lives  taken  from  us 
on  September  11,  2001,  and  all  of  those  who  so  nobly  aided  their  fellow 
citizens  in  America’s  time  of  need.  We  rededicate  ourselves  to  the  ideals 
that  define  our  country  and  unite  us  as  one,  as  we  commemorate  all  the 
heroes who lost their lives saving others. 
September 11, 2001, will forever be one of the most tragic days in American 
history.  Through  the  unimaginable  despair,  however,  ordinary  Americans 
etched  into  our  history  remarkable  illustrations  of  bravery,  of  sacrifice  for 
one  another,  and  of  dedication  to  our  shared  values.  The  shock  from  the 
indelible  images  of  the  smoke  rising  from  the  World  Trade  Center  and 
Pentagon  gave  way  to  countless  inspiring  videos  of  co-workers  helping  one 
another  to  safety;  of  heroes  running  into  collapsing  buildings  to  save  the 
innocent people trapped within; and to the unforgettable story of the patriots 
who  charged  the  cockpit  of  Flight  93  to  save  untold  numbers  of  lives. 
These  heroes  moved  us  with  their  bravery.  They  make  us  proud  to  be 
Americans. 
Throughout  history,  everyday  Americans  and  first  responders  have  done 
the extraordinary through selfless acts of patriotism, compassion, and uncom-
mon  courage.  Not  just  in  New  York,  Virginia,  and  Pennsylvania,  but  across 
our  great  Nation,  Americans  on  September  11,  2001,  bound  themselves 
together  for  the  common  good,  saying  with  one  voice  that  we  will  be 
neither  scared  nor  defeated.  The  enemy  attempted  to  tear  at  the  fabric 
of  our  society  by  destroying  our  buildings  and  murdering  our  innocent, 
but  our  strength  has  not  and  will  not  waiver.  Americans  today  remain 
steadfast in our commitment to liberty, to human dignity, and to one another. 
It  has  been  16  years  since  the  tragedy  of  September  11,  2001.  Children 
who  lost  their  parents  on  that  day  are  now  parents  of  their  own,  while 
many  teenagers  currently  in  high  school  learn  about  September  11th  only 
from  their  history  books.  Yet  all  Americans  are  imbued  with  the  same 
commitment  to  cause  and  love  of  their  fellow  citizens  as  everyone  who 
lived  through  that  dark  day.  We  will  never  forget.  The  events  of  September 
11,  2001,  did  not  defeat  us.  They  did  not  rattle  us.  They,  instead,  have 
rallied  us,  as  leaders  of  the  civilized  world,  to  defeat  an  evil  ideology 
that  preys  on  innocents  and  knows  nothing  but  violence  and  destruction. 
On  this  anniversary,  I  invite  all  Americans  to  thank  our  Nation’s  incredible 
service  members  and  first  responders,  who  are  on  the  front  lines  of  our 
fight  against  terrorism.  We  will  always  remember  the  sacrifices  made  in 
defense  of  our  people,  our  country,  and  our  freedom.  The  spirit  of  service 
and  self-sacrifice  that  Americans  so  nobly  demonstrated  on  September  11, 
2001,  is  evident  in  the  incredible  response  to  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma. 
The same spirit of American patriotism we movingly witnessed on September 
11th  has  filled  our  hearts  as  we  again  see  the  unflinching  courage,  compas-
sion,  and  generosity  of  Americans  for  their  neighbors  and  countrymen.  The 
service  members  and  first  responders  who  lost  their  lives  on  September 
11,  2001,  and  in  the  years  of  service  since  would  be  proud  of  what  we 
have  all  witnessed  over  these  last  three  weeks  and  what  will  undoubtedly

unfold  in  the  coming  months  of  recovery.  By  protecting  those  in  need, 
by  taking  part  in  acts  of  charity,  service,  and  compassion,  and  by  giving 
back  to  our  communities  and  country,  we  honor  those  who  gave  their 
lives on and after September 11, 2001. 
By  a  joint  resolution  approved  December  18,  2001  (Public  Law  107–89),

upon  all  departments,  agencies,  and  instrumentalities  of  the  United  States 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  at  half-staff  on  Patriot  Day  in 
honor  of  the  individuals  who  lost  their  lives  on  September  11,  2001.  I 
invite  the  Governors  of  the  United  States  and  its  territories  and  interested 
organizations  and  individuals  to  join  in  this  observance.  I  call  upon  the 
people  of  the  United  States  to  participate  in  community  service  in  honor 
of  those  our  Nation  lost,  to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies 
and  activities,  including  remembrance  services,  and  to  observe  a  moment 
of silence beginning at 8:46 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time to honor the innocent 
victims  who  perished  as  a  result  of  the  terrorist  attacks  of  September  11, 
2001. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  eighth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and

Proclamation  9590  of  April  7,  2017 

Pan  American  Day  and  Pan  American  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Pan American Day and Pan American Week commemorate the 127th anniver-
sary  of  the  conclusion  of  the  First  International  Conference  of  American 
States.  This  inter-American  gathering  planted  the  seed  for  the  creation  of 
the  Organization  of  American  States,  an  enduring  organization  for  the  pro-
motion  of  democracy,  security,  human  rights,  and  economic  development 
throughout the Americas. Pan American Day and Pan American Week remind 
us  to  reflect  on  the  shared  history  of  the  Americas  and  the  Caribbean 
and  to  commit  to  strengthening  relationships  with  our  regional  partners 
based on common interests and shared values. 
My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  improving  border  security,  dismantling 
transnational criminal networks, and combating terrorism to ensure the safety 
of our citizens. We are committed to constructive and cooperative engagement 
with  our  longstanding  Pan  American  partners,  building  on  existing  linkages 
and forging new relationships, to advance these critical objectives. 
The governments and people of the Americas are united through longstanding 
institutional,  economic,  cultural,  and  social  bonds.  In  conversations  and 
meetings with regional leaders, I continue to reinforce America’s commitment 
to  those  bonds  and  to  advancing  the  Pan  American  ideals  of  peace  and 
prosperity across the Western Hemisphere. As these conversations continue, 
we will find new ways to promote enhanced, reciprocal relationships among 
the  Pan  American  States,  advancing  the  well-being  of  people  throughout 
the region. 
As we celebrate Pan American Day and Pan American Week, commemorating 
the  formation  of  our  Pan  American  partnership  on  April  14,  1890,  let  us 
reaffirm  our  close  ties  and  pledge  to  work  together  on  shared  priorities 
that are vital to the interests of our countries. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  14,  2017, 
as  Pan  American  Day  and  April  9  through  April  15,  2017,  as  Pan  American 
Week.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  observe  this  day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9425  of  April  18,  2016 

Education  and  Sharing  Day,  U.S.A.,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our  Nation  has  long  been  driven  by  the  promise  that  anyone  willing  to 
work hard can make of their lives what they will, and ensuring opportunity 
is  within  reach  for  all  requires  us  to  provide  every  young  person  with 
access  to  a  high-quality  education.  Our  future  is  written  in  our  classrooms, 
and  on  Education  and  Sharing  Day,  U.S.A.,  we  reaffirm  our  belief  that 
no  matter  who  they  are,  where  they  come  from,  or  what  they  look  like, 
every  child  deserves  an  education  that  will  help  them  develop  their  unique 
talents and passions, dream beyond their present circumstances, and unlock 
their greatest potential. 
Investing  in  the  education  of  our  daughters  and  sons  is  among  the  best 
investments  we  can  make  as  a  Nation.  My  Administration  has  worked  to 
expand  high-quality  early  education—something  that  can  pay  off  over  a 
child’s  entire  lifetime—and  we  have  proposed  a  plan  to  offer  2  years  of 
free community college to anyone willing to work for it, because in America, 
a  quality  education  cannot  be  a  privilege  reserved  for  a  few.  Last  year, 
I  was  proud  to  sign  the  Every  Student  Succeeds  Act—bipartisan  legislation 
that will help prepare more of our young people to seize tomorrow’s possibili-
ties.  By  adopting  higher  academic  standards,  increasing  accountability  for 
underperforming  schools,  making  testing  more  efficient,  and  empowering 
State and local leaders to develop their own systems for school improvement 
based  on  evidence,  rather  than  impose  piecemeal  solutions  to  serious  prob-
lems,  this  law  provides  schools  across  America  with  the  resources  and 
flexibility  needed  for  students  to  thrive.  And  earlier  this  year,  I  announced 
Computer Science for All, a collaborative effort to give every child in America 
the opportunity to learn computer science, and in the time since, a growing 
coalition  of  businesses,  school  leaders,  and  State  and  local  governments 
have joined this initiative. 
As  we  continue  to  build  strong  foundations  for  our  students  here  at  home, 
we  recognize  those  around  the  world  who  are  prevented  from  obtaining 
a  quality  education.  That  is  why  my  Administration  launched  the  Let  Girls 
Learn initiative, spearheaded by First Lady Michelle Obama, to help adoles-
cent  girls  worldwide  get  the  quality  education  they  need  to  reach  their 
full potential. Through this campaign, we are helping to break down barriers 
for  girls  across  the  globe  and  working  to  shift  attitudes  and  beliefs,  affirm 
the  inherent  dignity  and  worth  of  every  child,  and  harness  the  power  of 
our  society  to  rise  above  our  present  obstacles  to  forge  the  future  we  know 
is possible. 
The advances we have made in education are a result of the many educators, 
administrators,  and  advocates  who  have  opened  the  doors  of  opportunity 
for countless young people. Today, we pay special tribute to Rabbi Menachem 
Mendel  Schneerson,  the  Lubavitcher  Rebbe,  for  his  tireless  devotion  to  ex-
tending  access  to  education  to  more  people—regardless  of  their  gender  or 
background.  The  Rebbe’s  lifetime  of  contribution  imparts  a  reminder  of 
the  tremendous  importance  of  making  sure  every  child  has  the  tools  and 
resources  they  need  to  grow,  flourish,  and  pursue  their  dreams.  On  this 
day,  let  us  carry  forward  the  Rebbe’s  legacy  by  recognizing  the  limitless

Proclamation  9421  of  April  8,  2016 

National  Former  Prisoner  of  War  Recognition  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Under  the  flag  of  the  United  States,  generations  of  women  and  men,  united 
in  a  common  cause  greater  than  themselves,  have  served  to  defend  the 
ideals  that  bind  us  together  as  a  Nation  and  that  preserve  our  country 
as  a  beacon  of  hope  and  freedom  around  the  world.  On  National  Former 
Prisoner  of  War  Recognition  Day,  we  salute  the  selfless  service  members 
throughout  our  history  who  gave  of  their  own  liberty  to  ensure  ours,  and 
we  renew  our  commitment  to  remaining  a  Nation  worthy  of  their  extraor-
dinary sacrifices. 
In  wars  and  engagements  since  America’s  founding,  brave  patriots  have 
experienced  indescribable  suffering  as  prisoners  of  war.  Often  physically 
and  mentally  tortured,  starved,  and  put  through  the  worst  most  of  us  could 
imagine,  these  heroes  are  owed  a  debt  we  can  never  fully  repay,  and  their 
families—who  exhibited  tremendous  fortitude  in  the  face  of  grueling  uncer-
tainty—are  worthy  of  our  profound  gratitude.  The  values  of  honor,  courage, 
and  selflessness  that  drive  our  Armed  Forces  are  particularly  acute  in  those 
who  have  been  taken  as  prisoners  of  war,  sustaining  them  through  days, 
weeks,  and  sometimes  years  of  profound  hardship  endured  for  the  sake 
of securing the blessings of liberty for all. 
America’s  former  prisoners  of  war—and  all  who  don  our  uniform  to  keep 
us  safe—have  helped  make  our  Nation  the  strongest  and  most  prosperous 
in  the  history  of  the  world.  Our  eternal  obligation  is  to  care  for  them 
and  uphold  our  everlasting  promise  to  never  leave  our  men  and  women 
on  the  battlefield  behind.  Let  us  reaffirm  our  adherence  to  these  ideals 
and  honor  our  former  prisoners  of  war  by  paying  them  the  gratitude  and 
respect they deserve. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  9,  2016,  as 
National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. I call upon all Americans 
to  observe  this  day  of  remembrance  by  honoring  all  American  prisoners 
of  war,  our  service  members,  and  our  veterans.  I  also  call  upon  Federal, 
State,  and  local  government  officials  and  organizations  to  observe  this  day 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Executive  Order  13719  of  February  9,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Federal  Privacy  Council 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  mission  of  the  United  States  Government  is  to  serve 
its  people.  In  order  to  accomplish  its  mission,  the  Government  lawfully 
collects,  maintains,  and  uses  large  amounts  of  information  about  people 
in a wide range of contexts. Protecting privacy in the collection and handling 
of  this  information  is  fundamental  to  the  successful  accomplishment  of 
the  Government’s  mission.  The  proper  functioning  of  Government  requires 
the  public’s  trust,  and  to  maintain  that  trust  the  Government  must  strive 
to  uphold  the  highest  standards  for  collecting,  maintaining,  and  using  per-
sonal data. Privacy has been at the heart of our democracy from its inception, 
and we need it now more than ever. 
Executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies)  already  take  seriously  their 
mission  to  protect  privacy  and  have  been  working  diligently  to  advance 
that  mission  through  existing  interagency  mechanisms.  Today’s  challenges, 
however,  require  that  we  find  even  more  effective  and  innovative  ways 
to improve the Government’s efforts. Our efforts to meet these new challenges 
and  preserve  our  core  value  of  privacy,  while  delivering  better  and  more 
effective  Government  services  for  the  American  people,  demand  leadership 
and  enhanced  coordination  and  collaboration  among  a  diverse  group  of 
stakeholders and experts. 
Therefore, it shall be the policy of the United States Government that agencies 
shall  establish  an  interagency  support  structure  that:  builds  on  existing 
interagency  efforts  to  protect  privacy  and  provides  expertise  and  assistance 
to agencies; expands the skill and career development opportunities of agency 
privacy professionals; improves the management of agency privacy programs 
by  identifying  and  sharing  lessons  learned  and  best  practices;  and  promotes 
collaboration  between  and  among  agency  privacy  professionals  to  reduce 
unnecessary  duplication  of  efforts  and  to  ensure  the  effective,  efficient, 
and consistent implementation of privacy policy Government-wide. 
Sec.  2.  Policy  on  Senior  Agency  Officials  for  Privacy.  Within  120  days 
of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and 
Budget  (Director)  shall  issue  a  revised  policy  on  the  role  and  designation 
of the Senior Agency Officials for Privacy. The policy shall provide guidance 
on the Senior Agency Official for Privacy’s responsibilities at their agencies, 
required  level  of  expertise,  adequate  level  of  resources,  and  other  matters 
as  determined  by  the  Director.  Agencies  shall  implement  the  requirements 
of  the  policy  within  a  reasonable  time  frame  as  prescribed  by  the  Director 
and consistent with applicable law. 
Sec. 3. Responsibilities of Agency Heads. The head of each agency, consistent 
with  guidance  to  be  issued  by  the  Director  as  required  in  section  2  of 
this order, shall designate or re-designate a Senior Agency Official for Privacy 
with  the  experience  and  skills  necessary  to  manage  an  agency-wide  privacy 
program.  In  addition,  the  head  of  each  agency,  to  the  extent  permitted 
by  law  and  consistent  with  ongoing  activities,  shall  work  with  the  Federal

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9456  of  May  31,  2016 

Great  Outdoors  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Every  day,  Americans  draw  inspiration  from  the  landscapes  and  outdoor 
spaces  that  surround  us  and  connect  us  with  our  heritage  and  with  one 
another. People have lived off of these lands and waters throughout history, 
and  today,  they  continue  to  enrich  our  national  experience.  In  June,  we 
celebrate  America’s  natural  and  cultural  treasures  and  rich  bounty  of  re-
sources,  and  we  recommit  to  upholding  our  responsibility,  as  those  who 
came  before  us  did,  to  ensure  they  are  sustained  for  those  who  will  inherit 
them. 

From dense forests and vast deserts to lakes and rivers teeming with wildlife, 
our  National  Parks  and  other  public  spaces  belong  to  all  of  us.  That  is 
why  I  have  sought  to  protect  places  that  are  culturally  and  historically 
significant  and  that  reflect  the  story  of  all  our  people.  My  Administration 
has  also  worked  hard  to  ensure  that  everyone  has  the  chance  to  easily 
visit and enjoy these spectacular areas. All Americans can explore the parks 
and  monuments  we  share  as  our  birthright,  including  through  the  ‘‘Find 
Your Park’’ campaign, which my Administration established to help connect 
people from all walks of life with new outdoor destinations and experiences. 
We also established the ‘‘Every Kid in a Park’’ initiative, offering free access 
to  our  National  Parks  and  other  public  lands  and  waters  for  an  entire 
year  to  fourth  grade  students  and  their  families.  And  by  increasing  funding 
for  the  21st  Century  Conservation  Service  Corps,  we  are  striving  to  give 
more  Americans  hands-on  opportunities  to  restore,  enhance,  and  give  back 
to the outdoor spaces that have given us so much. 

Our  experiences  in  nature  remind  us  how  fragile  our  ecosystems  can  be 
and  of  our  obligation  to  protect  them.  That  is  why  I  am  proud  to  have 
set  aside  more  than  265  million  acres  of  public  lands  and  waters—more 
than  any  President  in  our  history—and  why  my  Administration  has  taken 
unprecedented  action  to  tackle  climate  change.  The  planet  and  its  natural 
beauty  are  changing  as  rising  temperatures  fuel  the  melting  of  glaciers  and 
the increasing intensity of extreme weather events, including longer wildfire 
seasons  and  deeper  droughts,  and  as  seas  rise,  coastal  communities  face 
greater  threats  from  flooding  and  eroding  shorelines.  It  is  within  our  power 
to  address  the  peril  of  climate  change,  and  we  must  act  before  it  is  too 
late. 

During  Great  Outdoors  Month,  let  us  enjoy  our  Nation’s  natural  bounty, 
whether  in  reflective  solitude  or  in  the  energizing  company  of  friends  and 
family. As we rediscover the beauty of the outdoors—in our own backyards, 
along distant trails, or in the shadows of towering mountains—let us rededi-
cate ourselves to preserving nature’s splendor for future generations. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  June  2016  as  Great 
Outdoors  Month.  I  urge  all  Americans  to  explore  the  great  outdoors  and 
to uphold our Nation’s legacy of conserving our lands and waters.

Proclamation  9445  of  May  13,  2016 

Emergency  Medical  Services  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  day  across  our  Nation,  women  and  men  sacrifice  precious  time  with 
their  loved  ones,  working  long  and  hard  to  provide  emergency  medical 
services  (EMS)  to  people  they  have  never  met  before.  Often  operating  in 
the  midst  of  trauma  and  heartbreak,  these  professionals  deliver  urgent  and 
essential  care,  saving  lives  and  upholding  a  timeless  belief  that  defines 
who  we  are  as  Americans—that  we  all  must  look  out  for  one  another. 
This  week,  we  recognize  the  daily  heroism  of  our  EMS  professionals  at 
all  levels,  and  we  express  our  gratitude  for  their  efforts  to  keep  us  healthy 
and safe. 
Embodying  the  grit,  compassion,  and  courage  that  has  driven  our  Nation 
forward  since  its  founding,  our  emergency  medical  technicians,  paramedics, 
911 dispatchers, nurses, physicians, EMS medical directors, firefighters, and 
law  enforcement  officers  reflect  a  spirit  of  selflessness  that  makes  us  all 
strive to live up to their example. Their families stand beside them, enduring 
extraordinary  anticipation  and  exercising  sincere  patience  each  day.  As  the 
steady  anchors  in  an  otherwise  unpredictable  daily  routine,  these  families 
offer  unwavering  support  for  EMS  practitioners—giving  them  the  support 
and strength necessary to fulfill the demands of their unending work. 
EMS  providers  brave  danger  and  uncertainty,  and  their  efforts  deserve  our 
most  profound  appreciation.  We  rarely  know  when  tragedy  will  strike,  and 
in  our  most  vulnerable  moments,  we  rely  on  these  dedicated  professionals. 
During  Emergency  Medical  Services  Week,  let  us  celebrate  and  support 
the EMS professionals who demonstrate the values at the heart of the Amer-
ican spirit, and let us thank them for their heroic work. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  15  through 
May 21, 2016, as Emergency Medical Services Week. I encourage all Ameri-
cans  to  observe  this  occasion  by  showing  their  support  for  their  local  EMS 
providers and taking steps to improve their own personal safety and prepared-
ness.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9538  of  November  8,  2016 

World  Freedom  Day,  2016 

79985 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  Berlin  Wall  stood  in  the  city  it  divided  for  nearly  30  years,  separating 
families  and  loved  ones  and  embodying  the  authoritarianism  that  reigned 
in  Communist  states  throughout  the  Cold  War.  On  November  9,  1989,  with 
the  courage  of  their  convictions  and  a  longing  to  forge  their  own  destinies, 
Germans  from  both  the  East  and  West  sides  of  the  Wall  celebrated  history 
as  a  defining  symbol  of  the  Iron  Curtain  collapsed.  Twenty-seven  years 
later,  we  pay  tribute  to  the  unyielding  determination  of  those  who  chose 
unity  over  division,  and  we  rededicate  ourselves  to  carrying  this  spirit 
forward wherever core tenets of democracy and liberty are at stake. 
When  President  John  F.  Kennedy  declared  in  West  Berlin  that  ‘‘when  one 
man  is  enslaved,  all  are  not  free,’’  he  captured  the  irrevocable  truth  of 
the  work  that  remains  to  this  day.  Our  world  is  more  prosperous  and 
free  than  at  any  time  in  our  history,  with  more  people  than  ever  before 
choosing their leaders through free elections and living in democracies with 
greater  respect  for  human  rights.  But  such  liberty  will  not  emerge  across 
the  globe  in  a  single  wave—building  strong,  democratic  institutions  and 
maintaining  robust  civil  societies  is  the  work  of  generations,  and  it  is  up 
to  each  of  us  to  put  our  shoulders  to  the  wheel  of  progress  and  fight 
for  the  future  we  seek.  Whether  in  quiet  struggle  or  boisterous  protest, 
the  Berliners  who  endured  the  division  the  Berlin  Wall  created  and  stood 
for remind us of the necessity to never abandon the values that have brought 
us as far as we are today. 
For  centuries,  people  of  every  nation  have  borne  witness  to  great  strife 
and tension in our ever-changing world—but we have proven we can always 
choose  a  better  course  through  our  relentless  pursuit  of  freedom.  Across 
oceans and continents, in recognition of World Freedom Day, let us reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  carrying  forward  the  enduring  celebration  of  liberty 
that defined the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  9,  2016, 
as  World  Freedom  Day.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to 
observe  this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies  and  activities,  reaffirming 
our dedication to freedom and democracy.

Proclamation  9396  of  February  12,  2016 

Establishment  of  the  Sand  to  Snow  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  Sand  to  Snow  area  of  southern  California  is  an  ecological  and  cultural 
treasure,  a  microcosm  of  the  great  geographic  diversity  of  the  region.  Rising 
from the floor of the Sonoran Desert to the tallest peak in southern California, 
the  area  features  a  remarkable  diversity  of  plant  and  animal  species.  The 
area  includes  a  portion  of  the  San  Bernardino  National  Forest  and  connects 
this  area  with  Joshua  Tree  National  Park  to  the  east,  knitting  together  a 
mosaic  of  spectacular  landscapes  stretching  over  200  miles.  The  mountain 
peaks  of  the  Sand  to  Snow  area  frame  the  northeastern  reach  of  Coachella 
Valley along with the Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monu-
ment to the south. Home to desert oases at Big Morongo Canyon and White-
water  Canyon,  the  area  serves  as  a  refuge  for  desert  dwelling  animals  and 
a  stopover  for  migrating  birds.  The  archaeological  riches  of  the  Black  Lava 
Buttes  and  the  historical  remains  of  mining  and  ranching  communities  tell 
of  past  prosperity  and  struggle  in  this  arid  land.  The  unbroken  expanse 
is  an  invaluable  treasure  for  our  Nation  and  will  continue  to  serve  as 
an  irreplaceable  resource  for  archaeologists,  geologists,  and  biologists  for 
generations to come. 
The  Sand  to  Snow  area  encompasses  a  rich  diversity  of  geological  and 
ecological  resources,  including  a  nearly  10,000-foot  elevation  gradient  from 
the Sonoran Desert floor to the top of the 11,500-foot San Gorgonio Mountain, 
the  highest  mountain  in  southern  California.  From  the  flat  desert  lowlands, 
the  mountains  thrust  upward  in  stark  relief,  creating  indelible  beauty  along 
with  a  unique  diversity  of  resources  and  a  rich  history  of  human  habitation 
and movement. Along this remarkable topographic gradient lies an unusually 
wide range of ecosystems, ranging from lowland Mojave and Colorado deserts 
to scrub and woodlands and Mediterranean chaparral to subalpine and alpine 
conifer  forests.  San  Gorgonio  Mountain  is  one  end  of  the  longest  recorded 
line  of  sight  in  the  lower  48  States,  the  other  being  Mount  Whitney,  190 
miles  away.  In  addition,  the  Henry  Washington  Survey  Marker,  located 
on  San  Bernardino  Peak,  serves  as  the  starting  point  for  surveying  land 
in  southern  California  and  is  included  on  the  National  Register  of  Historic 
Places. 
San Gorgonio, so named after Saint Gorgonius by early 17th century Spanish 
missionaries, is just one name for this remarkable, region-defining mountain. 
The  Cahuilla  Indians  call  the  mountain  Kwiria-Kaich,  which  means  ‘‘bald’’ 
or ‘‘smooth,’’ and consider it among the sacred peaks of southern California. 
The  Gabrielino  Indians  from  the  Los  Angeles  Basin  treat  San  Gorgonio 
Mountain  with  reverence  and  refer  to  it  as  Akvangna.  The  Luisen˜ o  Indians 
consider  San  Gorgonio  Mountain  sacred  and  the  older  brother  of  Mount 
San  Jacinto;  both  peaks  were  among  the  first  born  of  Earth  Mother.  The 
Luisen˜ o refer to San Gorgonio Mountain as Pewipwi. 
Thirty  miles  of  the  world  famous  Pacific  Crest  National  Scenic  Trail  run 
through  the  Sand  to  Snow  area,  climbing  7,000  feet  from  the  desert  of 
Whitewater  Canyon  to  Mission  Springs  in  the  San  Bernardino  National 
Forest.  The  history  of  this  renowned  trail  dates  back  to  the  1920s  when 
the  idea  of  a  border-to-border  trail  was  first  conceptualized.  Although  the

establishment  of  the  trail  took  decades  to  fully  materialize,  today  the  trail 
is  a  national  icon,  highlighting  the  wilderness  treasures  of  the  American 
West.  Since  its  completion,  over  3,000  people  have  hiked  the  2,600  miles 
of  continuous  trail  along  the  Pacific  crest,  including  the  Mission  Creek 
Canyon segment found within the Sand to Snow area. 
The  Sand  to  Snow  area  first  took  its  current  shape  175  million  years  ago 
with  the  subduction  of  the  Pacific  Plate  beneath  the  North  American  Plate. 
The  San  Bernardino  Mountain  range  in  the  western  half  of  the  Sand  to 
Snow  area  is  unusual  in  California,  a  transverse  range  as  distinct  from 
the  north-south  mountain  ranges  found  through  most  of  California.  This 
difference  in  direction  results  from  a  change  in  the  San  Andreas  Fault, 
which shifts direction to the west of the Sand to Snow area. This intersection 
of  mountains  makes  this  area  a  critical  bridge  for  wildlife  traversing  the 
high elevations of southern California’s desert landscape. 
Two  branches  of  the  San  Andreas  Fault  run  through  the  Sand  to  Snow 
area,  and  the  faulting  that  created  the  mountains  and  canyons  throughout 
this  landscape  also  created  the  Morongo  Valley.  The  Whitewater  Canyon 
area has been featured in numerous studies of the plate tectonics and geologic 
rifting  of  southern  California,  including  studies  that  examine  the  impact 
of  earthquakes  on  fault  stability.  The  San  Bernardino  Mountains  and  Big 
Morongo  Canyon  contain  ancient  rocks  from  the  Proterozoic  Eon,  along 
with  some  of  the  oldest  exposed  rocks  in  California,  nearly  2  billion  years 
old.  Granite,  gneiss,  and  schist  in  these  areas  have  been  used  by  geologists 
to  better  understand  the  tectonic  history  of  the  region,  and  are  a  testament 
to the area’s important geologic past. 
Covering  a  range  of  nearly  10,000  feet  in  elevation,  the  Sand  to  Snow 
area  includes  an  extraordinarily  diverse  range  of  ecosystems  from  lowland 
deserts,  fresh  water  marshes,  and  Mojave  riparian  forests,  to  creosote  bush 
scrub  ecosystems,  and  alpine  peaks.  Hundreds  of  springs  rise  to  the  surface 
at  South  Fork  Meadows,  the  origin  of  the  South  Fork  of  the  Santa  Ana 
River. The Sand to Snow area has been important to biological and ecological 
research,  as  well  as  studies  of  climate  and  land  use  change,  the  impact 
of fires and invasive species management. 
The  area  has  a  remarkable  species  richness  that  makes  it  one  of  most 
biodiverse  areas  in  southern  California.  The  area  is  home  to  12  federally 
listed threatened and endangered animal species. Species include the endan-
gered  peninsular  bighorn  sheep,  San  Bernardino  Merriam’s  kangaroo  rat, 
Arroyo  toad,  Mountain  Yellow-legged  frog,  and  unarmored  threespine 
stickleback,  as  well  as  the  threatened  Santa  Ana  sucker,  Coachella  Valley 
fringe-toed lizard, and desert tortoise. 
A  tremendous  diversity  of  other  wildlife  species  also  make  their  homes 
here.  In  the  San  Gorgonio  Wilderness,  black  bears,  mountain  lions,  bobcats, 
mule  deer,  and  bighorn  sheep  can  all  be  found.  Species  such  as  ringtails, 
kit  fox,  striped  skunk,  California  ground  squirrel,  blacktail  jackrabbit,  and 
19  species  of  bat  live  in  the  Big  Morongo  Canyon  Preserve.  Amphibians 
and  reptiles  including  the  Mohave  Rattlesnake,  red  diamond  rattlesnake, 
rosy  boa,  desert  spiny  lizard,  California  kingsnake,  Western  whiptail,  and 
Pacific tree frog also live in the Sand to Snow area. 
The  Sand  to  Snow  area  is  famous  for  its  oases  frequented  by  over  240 
species  of  birds,  including  the  endangered  Least  Bell’s  vireo,  southwestern 
willow  flycatcher,  and  Yuma  clapper  rail,  as  well  as  the  threatened  coastal 
California gnatcatcher. Big Morongo Canyon, characterized by steep canyons, 
rugged  terrain,  and  desert  oases,  is  particularly  high  in  biodiversity  and 
is among the largest desert riparian habitats in California. It has been recog-
nized  as  among  the  most  important  avian  habitats  in  the  State.  Common 
birds  found  at  Big  Morongo  Canyon  include  shore  birds  like  the  American 
white  pelican,  great  blue  heron,  and  green  heron,  raptors  such  as  the 
Swainson’s  hawk,  Northern  Harrier,  and  American  kestrel,  owls,  including 
the  western  screech-owl  and  great  horned  owl,  and  hummingbirds,  wood-
peckers,  vireos,  and  finches.  Additionally,  32  species  of  migratory  birds

of  conservation  concern  have  been  identified  in  the  Sand  to  Snow  area, 
including  eagles,  sparrows,  owls,  hummingbirds,  woodpeckers,  and  falcons, 
among others. 
The Sand to Snow area is home to dozens of native plant species, including 
14  federally  listed  threatened  or  endangered  species  of  flowering  plants. 
These  include  the  endangered  California  dandelion,  Coachella  Valley  milk- 
vetch, Cushenbury buckwheat, Cushenbury oxytheca, pedate checker-mallow, 
San  Bernardino  bluegrass,  San  Bernardino  Mountains  bladderpod,  Santa 
Ana River woolly-star, slender-petaled mustard, and triple-ribbed milk-vetch 
and the threatened ash-grey paintbrush, Bear Valley sandwort, Parish’s daisy, 
and Southern Mountain wild-buckwheat. The southern-most stand of quaking 
aspen  trees  is  located  here  as  are  important  stands  of  white  fir  and  bigcone 
Douglas-fir. 
The  human  history  of  the  Sand  to  Snow  area  extends  back  thousands  of 
years.  People  now  identified  as  part  of  the  Takic  subset  of  the  large  Uto- 
Aztecan  group  of  Native  Americans  arrived  in  the  region  around  2,500 
years  ago.  Ancient  people  of  the  area  used  a  wide  variety  of  plants  from 
both  the  mountains  and  the  Mojave  desert,  such  as  honey  mesquite,  oak, 
pin˜ on,  cactus  fruits,  yucca  roots,  and  tubers  as  well  as  grasses,  seeds,  and 
berries.  Common  tools  were  made  of  wood,  bone,  shell,  stone,  clay,  and 
plant  fibers.  These  people  also  manufactured  woven  goods,  pipes  made 
of  stone,  awls  made  of  bone,  tools  associated  with  archery,  and  fire  drills. 
They  made  coiled  basketry  and  simple  undecorated  ceramic  pots  used  for 
storage and transport. 
The  name  ‘‘Serrano’’  was  given  to  people  living  in  the  Sand  to  Snow 
area  by  the  Spanish  missionaries  in  the  late  18th  century  and  translates 
from  Spanish  as  a  ‘‘person  from  the  mountains.’’  In  1834,  the  Spanish 
forcibly relocated many Serrano people to the missions. In 1840 the Serrano 
suffered  a  devastating  smallpox  outbreak,  and  the  disease  returned  in  1860. 
Ruth  Benedict,  one  of  the  world’s  foremost  cultural  anthropologists,  studied 
the  Serrano  extensively  in  1924.  However,  by  this  time  there  were  few 
remaining  eastern  groups  and  no  old  shamans  or  priests  survived.  Today, 
the  rich  archaeological  resources  in  this  area  serve  to  preserve  the  history 
of  the  Serrano  people.  Black  Lava  Butte,  topped  by  distinctive  basaltic 
lava flows, is sacred to the Serrano Tribe and home to a substantial number 
of archaeological sites, including evidence of habitation, rock art, and possible 
ritual  activities.  Black  Lava  Butte  contains  an  estimated  1,700  distinct 
petroglyphs,  most  of  which  have  not  yet  been  studied  and  may  provide 
insight  into  the  history  of  the  Serrano  and  other  tribes  in  the  region.  The 
mesa  also  contains  dozens  of  isolated  grinding  and  milling  sites  and  at 
least one shelter site, where many milling stones are present. 
After  the  Holcomb  Valley  gold  rush  of  1860,  ranchers  used  the  area  for 
grazing  sheep,  horses,  and  cattle.  Many  of  the  ranchers  kept  their  herds 
at  lower  elevations  during  the  winter  and  drove  their  stock  to  the  meadows 
of  the  San  Bernardino  Mountains  to  graze  during  the  summer  months.  Old 
cattle  paths,  watering  holes,  and  campsites  remain  a  part  of  the  landscape 
today.  Although  not  particularly  successful,  many  miners  prospected  in 
the  southeastern  portions  of  the  San  Bernardino  Mountains.  Evidence  still 
remains  in  the  form  of  old  cabins,  mine  shafts,  prospecting  pits,  and  refuse 
deposits. 
The protection of the Sand to Snow area will preserve its cultural, prehistoric, 
and  historic  legacy  and  maintain  its  diverse  array  of  natural  and  scientific 
resources, ensuring that the historic and scientific values of this area remain 
for  the  benefit  of  all  Americans.  In  addition  to  its  significant  scientific 
and  historic  values,  the  area  also  provides  world  class  outdoor  recreation 
opportunities, including hunting, fishing, hiking, camping, mountain biking, 
and horseback riding. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare

Federal Government to be the Sand to Snow National Monument (monument) 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  part  thereof 
all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Govern-
ment  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map,  which 
is attached to and forms a part of this proclamation. These reserved Federal 
lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately  154,000  acres.  The 
boundaries described on the accompanying map are confined to the smallest 
area  compatible  with  the  proper  care  and  management  of  the  objects  to 
be protected. 
All Federal lands and interests in lands within the boundaries of the monu-
ment  are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from  all  forms  of  entry,  loca-
tion,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the  public  land  laws  or 
laws  applicable  to  the  U.S.  Forest  Service,  from  location,  entry,  and  patent 
under  the  mining  laws,  and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to 
mineral  and  geothermal  leasing,  other  than  by  exchange  that  furthers  the 
protective purposes of the monument. 
The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  If 
the  Federal  Government  acquires  any  lands  or  interests  in  lands  not  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved 
as  a  part  of  the  monument,  and  objects  identified  above  that  are  situated 
upon  those  lands  and  interests  in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument, 
upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government. 
The  Secretary  of  Agriculture  and  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  (Secretaries) 
shall  manage  the  monument  through  the  U.S.  Forest  Service  (USFS)  and 
the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), pursuant to their respective applica-
ble  legal  authorities,  to  implement  the  purposes  of  this  proclamation.  The 
USFS  shall  manage  that  portion  of  the  monument  within  the  boundaries 
of  the  National  Forest  System  (NFS),  and  BLM  shall  manage  the  remainder 
of  the  monument.  The  lands  administered  by  USFS  shall  be  managed  as 
part  of  the  San  Bernardino  National  Forest.  The  lands  administered  by 
BLM  shall  be  managed  as  a  unit  of  the  National  Landscape  Conservation 
System, pursuant to applicable legal authorities. 
For  purposes  of  protecting  and  restoring  the  objects  identified  above,  the

Presidential Documents

Proclamation  9444  of  May  6,  2016 

Mother’s  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

On  Mother’s  Day,  we  celebrate  those  who  are  the  first  to  welcome  us 
into  the  world.  Performing  the  most  important  work  there  is,  mothers— 
biological,  foster,  or  adoptive—are  our  first  role  models  and  earliest 
motivators.  They  balance  enormous  responsibilities  and  shape  who  we  be-
come as adults, their lessons guiding us throughout life. Regardless of sexual 
orientation,  gender  identity,  or  marital  status,  mothers  have  always  moved 
our  Nation  forward  and  remained  steadfast  in  their  pursuit  of  a  better 
and brighter future for their children. 

Caring and loving without condition, even in our darkest moments, mothers 
put the interests of their kids ahead of their own. They are inspiring embodi-
ments  of  strength  and  determined  drivers  of  progress,  and  through  their 
example,  our  youth  learn  the  values  of  grace,  empathy,  and  kindness.  For 
generations,  mothers  have  led  the  charge  toward  a  freer,  more  inclusive 
country—embracing  the  task  of  ensuring  our  Nation  upholds  its  highest 
ideals  so  that  they,  and  America’s  daughters,  know  the  same  opportunities 
as America’s fathers and sons. 

Our  country’s  mothers  deserve  our  unwavering  support—at  home,  in  the 
workplace, and throughout our communities. I am committed to empowering 
working  mothers  so  they  do  not  have  to  choose  between  caring  for  their 
family  and  earning  their  paycheck,  and  I  will  continue  fighting  to  ensure 
those who choose to become mothers are not financially punished for doing 
so.  My  Administration  has  pushed  to  expand  child  care  and  strengthen 
paid  leave,  including  maternity  leave.  We  will  also  keep  working  to  close 
the gender pay gap—a disparity that is contrary to our values as Americans, 
limits  the  scope  of  mothers’  futures,  and  affects  those  they  provide  for. 
And  earlier  this  year,  we  launched  an  effort  to  help  low-income  mothers 
and families afford diapers—a basic necessity for babies—by bringing together 
online  retailers,  diaper  manufacturers,  and  nonprofits  to  reduce  the  high 
cost of diapers. 

Each  of  us  is  the  son  or  daughter  of  a  mother.  Today,  let  us  pay  these 
extraordinary  women  the  admiration  and  respect  they  deserve.  And  each 
day,  let  us  thank  them  for  all  they  have  done  for  us,  remember  those 
whose  spirits  remain  with  us,  and  support  those  who  take  on  the  awesome 
mantle of motherhood. 

The  Congress,  by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  8,  1914  (38  Stat.  770), 
has  designated  the  second  Sunday  in  May  each  year  as  ‘‘Mother’s  Day’’ 
and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  8,  2016,  as  Mother’s  Day.  I  urge 
all  Americans  to  express  love  and  gratitude  to  mothers  everywhere,  and 
I  call  upon  all  citizens  to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  programs, 
ceremonies, and activities.

Proclamation  9526  of  October  18,  2016 

Minority  Enterprise  Development  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  our  earliest  days,  entrepreneurship  has  embodied  the  very  promise 
of our Nation, reaffirming the notion that in a place of such limitless potential, 
Americans can forge a prosperous future and build a better life for themselves 
and  their  families.  Women  and  men  of  every  faith,  background,  and  race 
have  channeled  their  talents  and  ingenuity  into  harnessing  the  spirit  of 
innovation that has long been the hallmark of our people. And as an essential 
part  of  our  country’s  story,  minority-owned  enterprises  have  helped  spur 
this  progress.  During  Minority  Enterprise  Development  Week,  we  reflect 
on  the  significant  ways  they  have  helped  put  our  economy  on  the  path 
to  success,  and  we  recommit  to  empowering  every  hardworking  American 
to write our next great chapters. 
Minority-owned  firms  employ  millions  of  workers  and  generate  more  than 
$1  trillion  in  economic  output,  revitalizing  our  communities  and  driving 
our  growth.  That  is  why  my  Administration  is  helping  entrepreneurs  of 
all  backgrounds  and  small  businesses  across  our  country  get  the  resources 
they need to get off the ground. Through the Minority Business Development 
Agency,  we  have  led  efforts  to  promote  growth  and  competitiveness.  We 
are  helping  streamline  the  process  of  starting  a  company  and  investing 
in entrepreneurship training and skill building for more Americans. Through 
www.Business.USA.gov,  we  are  helping  more  enterprises  get  information 
about  Federal  contracts,  and  we  are  connecting  them  to  critical  resources 
to  help  develop  and  grow  a  business.  In  today’s  global  economy,  minority- 
owned  businesses  are  essential  to  our  country’s  success.  They  are  twice 
as  likely  as  other  businesses  to  export  their  goods  and  services,  and  I 
am  working  to  encourage  entrepreneurship  and  innovation  through  a  smart 
trade agenda that will allow us to sell more goods, boost economic competi-
tiveness, and help more of our entrepreneurs thrive. 
Our  Nation  has  always  drawn  strength  from  the  diversity  of  our  people, 
and  no  matter  who  you  are,  what  you  look  like,  or  where  you  come  from, 
America  is  a  place  where  everyone  deserves  a  chance  to  get  ahead.  This 
week,  we  must  continue  working  to  support  minority  enterprises  and  all 
entrepreneurs—and ensure that by expanding access to the networks, capital, 
and  opportunities  required  to  build  a  business,  everybody  can  have  a  fair 
shot at reaching their piece of the American dream. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  23  through 
October  29,  2016,  as  Minority  Enterprise  Development  Week.  I  call  upon 
all Americans to celebrate this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, 
and  activities  to  recognize  the  many  contributions  of  our  Nation’s  minority 
enterprises.

Notice  of  August  4,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Ex-
port  Control  Regulations 

On August 17, 2001, consistent with the authority provided to the President 
under  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701 
et seq.), the President issued Executive Order 13222. In that order, he declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States 
in  light  of  the  expiration  of  the  Export  Administration  Act  of  1979,  as 
amended  (50  U.S.C.  App.  2401  et  seq.).  Because  the  Export  Administration 
Act has not been renewed by the Congress, the national emergency declared 
on August 17, 2001, must continue in effect beyond August 17, 2016. There-
fore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency 
declared  in  Executive  Order  13222,  as  amended  by  Executive  Order  13637 
(March 8, 2013). 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  March  30,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
South  Sudan 

On April 3, 2014, by Executive Order 13664, I declared a national emergency, 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706), to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  situation 
in  and  in  relation  to  South  Sudan,  which  has  been  marked  by  activities 
that  threaten  the  peace,  security,  or  stability  of  South  Sudan  and  the  sur-
rounding region, including widespread violence and atrocities, human rights 
abuses,  recruitment  and  use  of  child  soldiers,  attacks  on  peacekeepers,  and 
obstruction of humanitarian operations. 
The  situation  in  and  in  relation  to  South  Sudan  continues  to  pose  an 
unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on 
April  3,  2014,  to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect  beyond 
April  3,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 13664. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9498  of  September  16,  2016 

National  Farm  Safety  and  Health  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  generations,  farmers  and  ranchers  have  formed  the  backbone  of  our 
economy  and  shaped  the  course  of  our  Nation.  They  have  served  as  critical 
stewards  of  our  environment  and  natural  resources.  Toiling  day  in  and 
day out in rural communities across our country, their dedication and dogged 
work  ethic  provide  us  with  food,  fuel,  and  other  necessities,  sustaining 
our  people  and  our  communities.  Throughout  National  Farm  Safety  and 
Health  Week,  we  honor  their  significant  contributions  by  reaffirming  our 
commitment  to  bolstering  programs  and  practices  that  promote  health  and 
safety on America’s farms. 
Millions  of  farmers  and  their  families  face  a  variety  of  unsafe  conditions 
when they wake up for work each morning. Extreme weather, and exposure 
to  livestock  or  hazardous  chemicals  can  pose  threats  to  their  safety.  Much 
of  their  work  takes  place  in  dangerous  environments  and  with  potentially 
harmful  equipment,  such  as  wells,  silos,  and  grain  bins.  And  putting  in 
long  hours  of  physical  labor  can  also  cause  illness  or  injury.  Our  farmers 
and  ranchers  are  exposed  to  too  many  of  these  dangers,  and  we  must 
ensure  they  are  equipped  with  the  tools,  trainings,  and  resources  they  need 
to take proper precautions and safety measures in their workplaces. 
To  reduce  work-related  accidents  and  deaths  among  farming  communities, 
my Administration has encouraged regular participation in health and safety 
programs.  Increasing  awareness  of  proper  procedures  is  crucial,  and  farmers 
and  farmworkers  can  improve  their  safety  practices  by  correctly  handling 
materials  and  inspecting  machinery,  paying  careful  attention  to  instructions 
and  labels  on  products  and  equipment,  and  practicing  and  communicating 
plans  for  emergency  response.  Because  many  farms  and  ranches  are  family 
businesses,  we  have  partnered  with  people  across  our  country  to  help  for-
malize  youth  farm  safety  education  to  improve  farm  safety  for  children. 
The  best  farmers  in  the  world  have  enriched  our  Nation  and  driven  our 
agriculture  sector  forward;  it  is  our  shared  duty  to  ensure  their  health 
and  safety,  because  we  all  have  a  stake  in  the  well-being  of  those  who 
provide  us  with  food  and  energy.  By  maintaining  safe  work  environments 
and  taking  steps  to  practice  caution  on  our  farms,  we  can  minimize  risks 
and increase productivity in one of the greatest and most essential industries 
in America. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 18 through 
September  24,  2016,  as  National  Farm  Safety  and  Health  Week.  I  call  upon 
the  agencies,  organizations,  businesses,  and  extension  services  that  serve 
America’s agricultural workers to strengthen their commitment to promoting 
farm safety and health programs. I also urge Americans to honor our agricul-
tural  heritage  and  express  appreciation  to  our  farmers,  ranchers,  and  farm-
workers for their contributions to our Nation. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  sixteenth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the

Proclamation  9506  of  September  29,  2016 

Child  Health  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Today’s  youth  will  shape  our  Nation’s  narrative  and  drive  our  progress, 
and  it  is  our  duty  to  ensure  our  young  people  are  given  every  opportunity 
to  live  full,  healthy  lives.  Securing  a  bright  future  for  America’s  daughters 
and  sons  requires  us  to  continue  expanding  access  to  quality  health  care 
and  working  to  foster  cleaner,  safer,  and  more  supportive  environments. 
On  Child  Health  Day,  we  renew  our  strong  commitment  to  protecting  and 
empowering our children by giving them the tools, resources, and knowledge 
they need to grow into healthy and productive adults. 
My  Administration  has  made  children’s  health  a  top  priority  throughout 
the past 8 years. Through First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative, 
we  have  worked  to  bring  parents,  schools,  and  communities  together  to 
reduce  childhood  obesity  by  increasing  access  to  affordable  and  nutritious 
food,  and  by  encouraging  physical  activity  early  on  in  life.  Parents  and 
guardians  serve  as  role  models  when  it  comes  to  forming  healthy  habits, 
and  they  can  help  their  children  learn  to  make  smart  choices  that  will 
shape their lifestyles for years to come. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no child can be denied coverage because 
of a pre-existing condition, and millions of young people are able to remain 
on  a  parent’s  insurance  plan  until  age  26.  Cancer  touches  the  lives  of 
millions  of  Americans,  and  pediatric  cancer  remains  the  leading  cause  of 
death by disease among children. Earlier this year, I called on Vice President 
Joe Biden to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force—a collabo-
rative  effort  that  is  striving  to  make  a  decade’s  worth  of  progress  in  pre-
venting,  diagnosing,  and  treating  cancer  in  just  5  years  and  is  dedicated 
to ending cancer as we know it. 
Supporting  our  children’s  emotional  and  mental  health  is  just  as  critical 
as  protecting  their  physical  health.  Bullying  touches  the  lives  of  young 
people  across  our  country  and  can  affect  their  mental  health,  and  we  are 
committed  to  providing  parents  and  schools  with  the  support  they  need 
to  address  harassment—because  no  child  should  be  hurt,  and  no  child 
should feel ashamed because of who they are. 
As we face growing environmental threats, it is our responsibility to combat 
climate  change  and  protect  our  planet  for  future  generations.  That  is  why 
we  have  taken  concrete  steps  to  address  carbon  pollution  and  advocate 
for  cleaner  energy  options.  Through  the  Paris  Climate  Agreement,  we  are 
joining  with  nearly  200  countries  to  adopt  ambitious  measures  that  will 
reduce  carbon  pollution  across  the  globe.  By  taking  unprecedented  action 
to  protect  the  air  we  breathe  and  the  water  we  drink,  we  are  striving 
to  reduce  the  harmful  effects  that  climate  change  can  have  on  our  children, 
including  the  potential  for  higher  incidence  of  asthma  attacks,  and  other 
health problems exacerbated by dirty air. 
This  Child  Health  Day,  we  are  reminded  that  the  well-being  of  America’s 
children  is  in  our  hands  and  that  it  is  our  responsibility  to  keep  building 
a  society  that  will  allow  them  to  thrive.  Let  us  reaffirm  our  belief  in  the 
notion  that  all  children  should  be  able  to  live  a  healthy  and  happy  life— 
no matter where they come from or what they look like—and let us continue

reaching  for  a  future  where  all  our  children  are  limited  by  nothing  but 
the size of their dreams. 
The  Congress,  by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  18,  1928,  as  amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October 
as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation 
in observance of this day. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  Monday,  October  3,  2016,  as  Child  Health 
Day.  I  call  upon  families,  educators,  health  professionals,  faith-based  and 
community organizations, and all levels of government to help ensure Amer-
ica’s children are healthy. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and

Proclamation  9532  of  October  28,  2016 

National  Diabetes  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
More  than  29  million  Americans  have  diabetes—a  disease  in  which  the 
glucose  levels  in  one’s  blood  are  higher  than  normal.  Although  the  rate 
of  new  cases  is  falling,  the  numbers  are  still  alarming.  Diabetes  is  one 
of  the  leading  causes  of  death  in  the  United  States  and  results  in  staggering 
health  and  financial  costs  for  Americans.  With  a  concentrated  effort  to 
reduce  the  number  of  new  diagnoses  and  improve  treatment  and  care  for 
those  living  with  this  disease,  we  must  continue  making  progress  in  the 
battle  against  this  epidemic.  Each  year  during  National  Diabetes  Month, 
we resolve to support everyone battling this chronic disease, and we recom-
mit to fighting it so that more Americans can lead a healthy life. 
Diabetes can affect individuals of any age, gender, or background depending 
on  risk  factors,  which  can  include  a  combination  of  genetics  and  lifestyle. 
Type  1  diabetes,  often  diagnosed  in  youth,  affects  people  whose  bodies 
do  not  produce  enough  insulin,  a  hormone  needed  to  live.  Type  2  diabetes 
occurs  in  people  who  are  not  able  to  produce  enough  insulin  to  meet 
their  body’s  needs,  and  typically  develops  in  adults—however,  more  young 
people  today  are  being  diagnosed  with  type  2  diabetes  than  ever  before, 
and it is more commonly diagnosed among those who are obese or inactive. 
Both  types  can  lead  to  health  problems  such  as  heart  disease,  blindness, 
and kidney failure. Additionally, roughly one-third of American adults have 
prediabetes—a  condition  in  which  their  blood  sugar  levels  are  higher  than 
normal,  but  not  high  enough  to  be  diagnosed  with  diabetes—placing  them 
at  higher  risk  for  other  health  conditions  or  for  developing  type  2  diabetes. 
Another  form  of  diabetes,  known  as  gestational  diabetes,  can  develop  in 
pregnant  women,  create  complications  during  pregnancy,  and  increase 
chances  of  developing  type  2  diabetes  later  in  life  for  both  mothers  and 
their children. 
Type  1  diabetes  accounts  for  a  smaller  proportion  of  diagnosed  cases  of 
diabetes; over 90 percent of all diagnosed cases are type 2 diabetes. Individ-
uals  with  type  1  diabetes  need  to  monitor  their  blood  sugar  levels  and 
take  insulin  every  day  to  survive.  Diabetes  has  no  cure,  but  people  with 
type  2  diabetes  can  manage  their  disease  by  following  a  healthy  meal  plan, 
increasing  physical  activity,  taking  prescribed  medications,  and  quitting 
smoking  if  applicable.  For  individuals  with  prediabetes  or  overweight  indi-
viduals  at  higher  risk  of  diabetes,  losing  weight  through  healthy  eating 
and  regular  physical  activity  can  help  prevent  or  delay  type  2  diabetes. 
Americans  with  any  type  of  diabetes  should  get  regular  checkups  and  work 
with  health  care  professionals  to  learn  more  about  this  disease.  Individuals 
at  higher  risk—particularly  those  who  are  overweight,  older  than  45,  or 
have  a  family  history  of  type  2  diabetes—should  talk  to  their  health  care 
providers about their diabetes risk. African Americans, Hispanic Americans, 
American Indians, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders are also at higher 
risk  of  developing  type  2  diabetes.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  visit 
www.NDEP.NIH.gov to find resources available through the National Diabetes 
Education  Program  to  help  make  and  sustain  healthy  lifestyle  and  behavior 
changes.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  212 / Wednesday,  November  2,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

Over  the  last  8  years,  my  Administration  has  worked  to  provide  better 
care,  prevention,  and  treatment  for  anyone  suffering  from  diabetes.  The 
Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA)  has  required  that  insurers  cover  preventive  serv-
ices  such  as  certain  diabetes  screenings  without  copays  or  deductibles,  and 
seniors  can  now  receive  these  screenings  free  of  charge  as  well.  Insurance 
companies can no longer deny individuals coverage because of a pre-existing 
condition,  including  a  family  history  of  diabetes,  and  children  can  now 
stay  on  a  parent’s  health  insurance  plan  until  age  26.  By  supporting  the 
Diabetes  Prevention  Program—the  first  preventive  service  model  eligible 
for  expansion  under  Medicare—the  ACA  has  improved  the  quality  of  care, 
reduced health care costs, and helped prevent the onset of diabetes. 
Nearly  one  in  three  American  children  is  overweight  or  obese,  causing 
a  rise  in  the  prevalence  of  type  2  diabetes  among  children.  Unless  we 
act, approximately one-third of all children born since the turn of the century 
will suffer from diabetes during their lifetimes. The First Lady’s Let’s Move! 
initiative has worked to reverse this childhood obesity trend and put children 
on a path to a healthy future during their earliest years by fostering environ-
ments  that  support  healthy  choices;  promoting  physical  activity;  providing 
healthier  foods  in  our  schools;  and  ensuring  families  have  access  to  nutri-
tious,  affordable  foods  and  the  information  they  need  to  make  healthy 
choices.  We  have  also  harnessed  the  American  spirit  of  innovation  through 
our Precision Medicine Initiative: By tailoring treatments to individuals based 
on  personalized  information  such  as  genetics,  we  can  move  closer  to  curing 
diseases  like  diabetes  and  give  more  Americans  the  opportunity  to  live 
full, healthy lives. 
Every  year,  too  many  Americans  experience  the  consequences  of  diabetes— 
but  in  part  because  of  the  dedication  of  our  Nation’s  health  care  providers, 
researchers,  and  advocates,  we  have  made  important  strides  in  combating 
this  disease,  and  we  have  reason  to  hope  this  progress  will  continue.  This 
month,  let  us  work  to  show  every  individual  living  with  diabetes  that 
they  are  not  alone,  and  let  us  continue  strengthening  our  investment  in 
the fight against this disease. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as  National  Diabetes  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans,  school  systems, 
government agencies, nonprofit organizations, health care providers, research 
institutions, and other interested groups to join in activities that raise diabetes 
awareness and help prevent, treat, and manage the disease.

The  President 

Presidential Documents

87397 

Proclamation  9547  of  November  30,  2016 

National  Impaired  Driving  Prevention  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Driving  drunk,  drugged,  or  distracted  poses  a  significant  threat  to  drivers, 
passengers,  pedestrians,  and  all  who  share  our  roads.  During  the  holiday 
season,  incidents  of  impaired  driving  occur  more  frequently,  and  every 
December, we observe National Impaired Driving Prevention Month to high-
light steps we can take to improve safety on our streets and raise awareness 
of these preventable dangers. 
Recently,  the  number  of  traffic  crash  fatalities  caused  by  impaired  driving 
has  unfortunately  increased—last  year,  preventable  alcohol-related  driving 
fatalities  accounted  for  nearly  one-third  of  all  traffic  fatalities.  Consumption 
of  alcohol  by  drivers,  even  those  who  are  of  legal  drinking  age,  is  highly 
dangerous,  and  drug  use,  including  prescription  drug  use,  can  also  harm 
judgment,  perception,  and  the  motor  skills  used  when  driving.  Distracted 
driving—including  eating,  tending  to  passengers,  and  using  a  cell  phone— 
can also be dangerous and is equally preventable. 
We  can  all  do  our  part  to  keep  our  roads  safe  and  prevent  these  tragedies. 
As passengers, we can reduce our interactions with drivers and lessen distrac-
tions.  As  friends  and  family  members,  we  can  look  out  for  loved  ones 
who  may  be  drinking  and  help  them  get  home  safely.  And  as  citizens, 
we can always call 911 to report any dangerous driving we observe. 
My  Administration  has  worked  to  help  Americans  who  struggle  with  sub-
stance  use  disorders  and  substance  misuse,  which  can  lead  to  incidents 
of  drunk  or  drugged  driving.  We  are  also  striving  to  give  law  enforcement 
officers  the  resources  and  support  they  need  to  combat  impaired  driving, 
and  we  must  encourage  the  development  of  technologies  like  ignition  inter-
lock  devices,  which  can  prevent  impaired  individuals  from  getting  behind 
the  wheel.  Through  the  Drive  Sober  or  Get  Pulled  Over  campaign,  States 
and  communities  across  our  country  are  working  to  increase  road  patrols 
and  sobriety  checkpoints,  in  addition  to  raising  awareness  and  improving 
education  on  the  dangers  of  impaired  driving.  You  can  learn  more  about 
what we are doing to prevent impaired driving by visiting www.WhiteHouse.
gov/ONDCP/DruggedDriving, 
and 
www.Distraction.gov. 
Whether  encouraging  parents  to  set  a  good  example  for  their  teen  drivers 
or educating every driver on the dangers of unsafe driving, we must recommit 
to  doing  everything  we  can  to  prevent  driving-related  injuries  and  fatalities. 
This  month,  let  us  continue  empowering  drivers  to  make  responsible  deci-
sions  and  educating  the  American  people  on  ways  they  can  help  keep 
our roads safe and our futures bright. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  December  2016 
as  National  Impaired  Driving  Prevention  Month.  I  urge  all  Americans  to 
make  responsible  decisions  and  take  appropriate  measures  to  prevent  im-
paired driving.

Proclamation  9552  of  December  9,  2016 

Death  of  John  Glenn 

90663 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  a  mark  of  respect  for  the  memory  of  John  Glenn,  I  hereby  order,  by 
the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United 
States  of  America,  that  the  flag  of  the  United  States  shall  be  flown  at 
half-staff  at  the  White  House  and  upon  all  public  buildings  and  grounds, 
at  all  military  posts  and  naval  stations,  and  on  all  naval  vessels  of  the 
Federal  Government  in  the  District  of  Columbia  and  throughout  the  United 
States  and  its  Territories  and  possessions  until  sunset,  on  the  day  of  inter-
ment.  I  also  direct  that  the  flag  shall  be  flown  at  half-staff  for  the  same 
period  at  all  United  States  embassies,  legations,  consular  offices,  and  other 
facilities  abroad,  including  all  military  facilities  and  naval  vessels  and  sta-
tions. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  ninth  day  of 
December, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9534  of  October  31,  2016 

National  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
A  heartbreaking  disease  present  in  more  than  5  million  Americans,  Alz-
heimer’s  is  the  most  common  form  of  dementia  and  causes  people  to  lose 
many  of  the  critical  abilities  they  need  to  live  independently.  Too  often, 
those suffering from Alzheimer’s cannot recognize their loved ones or remem-
ber  how  to  perform  daily  tasks,  struggling  physically  and  mentally  with 
things that once came naturally. Although we have long known Alzheimer’s 
to  be  irreversible  and  fatal,  we  maintain  hope  that  by  advancing  research 
and  treatment  options  we  can  work  to  change  these  outcomes  and  ensure 
brighter  prospects  for  all  those  who  face  this  disease.  During  National  Alz-
heimer’s  Disease  Awareness  Month,  we  resolve  to  continue  working  toward 
this  brighter  future  as  we  stand  with  every  person  battling,  Alzheimer’s 
and their loved ones. 
Alzheimer’s  disease  is  more  likely  to  affect  Americans  as  they  grow  older— 
although  genetics  can  also  play  a  role,  age  is  the  most  significant  risk 
factor.  But  Alzheimer’s  touches  many  more  individuals  than  simply  those 
who  are  diagnosed.  Dedicated  caregivers—whether  professionals,  family 
members,  or  friends—are  also  emotionally,  physically,  and  financially  af-
fected  by  Alzheimer’s  disease,  giving  of  themselves  to  ensure  those  who 
face it are not alone. And because these individuals need access to informa-
tion  and  resources  in  order  to  provide  this  essential  care,  we  launched 
www.Alzheimers.gov to give them a place to find help. 
Through  the  National  Plan  to  Address  Alzheimer’s  Disease,  my  Administra-
tion has been working to meet a goal of being able to prevent and effectively 
treat  this  illness  by  2025.  Over  the  past  year  we  have  taken  a  number 
of  actions  to  reach  this  vision,  including  developing  a  training  curriculum 
that  gives  health  care  workers  the  necessary  skills  to  care  for  dementia 
patients  and  better  detect  and  diagnose  dementia.  We  have  also  helped 
family  caregivers  look  after  their  own  health,  in  addition  to  addressing 
the  needs  of  people  with  dementia,  and  launched  a  campaign  to  increase 
awareness  of  changes  in  the  brain  as  people  age  so  that  older  adults  feel 
more comfortable having open conversations with family members and health 
care providers. 
In  addition  to  ensuring  anyone  with  Alzheimer’s  can  access  proper  care, 
we must harness the innovative ideas of the scientific community and work 
to  prevent  this  disease.  To  ramp  up  research  and  development  aimed  at 
uncovering the answers to diseases like Alzheimer’s, I have increased funding 
for research dedicated to understanding, preventing, and curing Alzheimer’s 
and related dementias. I also introduced the Brain Research through Advanc-
ing  Innovative  Neurotechnologies  Initiative,  which  will  enhance  our  under-
standing  of  brain  function  and  give  scientists  the  tools  they  need  to  better 
understand and discover new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders. 
And  through  a  bold  new  research  effort  that  seeks  to  deliver  personalized 
care through patient-centered research and collaboration, my Precision Medi-
cine  Initiative  is  working  to  revolutionize  our  understanding  of  diseases 
like Alzheimer’s.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  213 / Thursday,  November  3,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

From  researchers  and  advocates  who  are  bringing  us  closer  to  preventing 
this  disease  to  family  members  who  devotedly  look  after  their  loved  ones, 
people  across  our  country  are  doing  their  part  to  support  those  touched 
by  Alzheimer’s.  This  month,  let  us  honor  those  we  have  lost  too  soon 
and  renew  our  efforts  to  ensure  more  Americans  can  live  their  lives  with 
health and happiness. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as  National  Alzheimer’s  Disease  Awareness  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people 
of  the  United  States  to  learn  more  about  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  support 
the individuals living with this disease and their caregivers. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9389  of  January  15,  2016 

Religious  Freedom  Day,  2016 

3689 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  our  country’s  founding,  religious  freedom  has  been  heralded  as  one 
of our most cherished ideals. The right to practice religion freely has brought 
immigrants  from  all  over  the  world  to  our  shores,  often  in  the  face  of 
great adversity, so they could live their lives in accordance with the dictates 
of their consciences. Some of America’s earliest settlers, the Pilgrims, arrived 
at our shores in search of a more tolerant society, free from religious persecu-
tion.  Since  that  time,  people  of  many  religious  traditions  have  added  their 
own  threads  to  the  fabric  of  our  Nation,  helping  advance  a  profound  and 
continuous vindication of the idea of America. 
When  the  Virginia  Statute  for  Religious  Freedom  was  adopted  on  January 
16,  1786,  it  formed  a  blueprint  for  what  would  become  the  basis  for  the 
protection  of  religious  liberty  enshrined  in  our  Constitution.  Drafted  by 
Thomas Jefferson, the statute proclaims that ‘‘all men shall be free to profess, 
and  by  argument  to  maintain,  their  opinions  in  matters  of  religion,  and 
that  the  same  shall  in  no  wise  diminish,  enlarge,  or  affect  their  civil  capac-
ities.’’ The First Amendment prohibits Government from establishing religion, 
and  it  protects  the  free  exercise  of  every  faith.  Our  Government  does  not 
sponsor  a  religion,  nor  does  it  pressure  anyone  to  practice  a  particular 
faith,  or  any  faith  at  all.  The  United  States  stands  for  the  protection  of 
equal  rights  for  all  people  to  practice  their  faith  freely,  without  fear  or 
coercion, and as Americans, we understand that when people of all religions 
are  accepted  and  are  full  and  equal  members  of  our  society,  we  are  all 
stronger and freer. 
Our  commitment  to  religious  freedom  has  fostered  unprecedented  religious 
diversity  and  freedom  of  religious  practice.  But  these  ideals  are  not  self- 
executing.  Rather,  they  require  a  sustained  commitment  by  each  generation 
to  uphold  and  preserve  them.  Here  at  home,  my  Administration  is  working 
to preserve religious liberty and enforce civil rights laws that protect religious 
freedom—including  laws  that  protect  employees  from  religious  discrimina-
tion  and  require  reasonable  accommodation  of  religious  practices  on  the 
job.  We  will  keep  upholding  the  right  of  religious  communities  to  establish 
places of worship and protecting the religious rights of those so often forgot-
ten  by  society,  such  as  incarcerated  persons  and  individuals  confined  to 
institutions.  We  will  also  continue  to  protect  students  from  discrimination 
and harassment that is based on their faith, and we will continue to enforce 
hate  crime  laws,  including  those  perpetrated  based  on  a  person’s  actual 
or  perceived  religion.  This  work  is  crucial,  particularly  given  the  recent 
spike in reports of threats and violence against houses of worship, children, 
and adults simply because of their religious affiliation. 
As  we  strive  to  uphold  religious  freedom  at  home,  we  recognize  that  this 
basic  element  of  human  dignity  does  not  stop  at  our  shores,  and  we  work 
to  promote  religious  freedom  around  the  globe.  We  are  working  with  a 
broad  coalition  against  those  who  have  subjected  religious  minorities  to 
unspeakable  violence  and  persecution,  and  we  are  mobilizing  religious  and 
civic  leaders  to  defend  vulnerable  religious  communities.  In  addition,  we 
are calling for the elimination of improper restrictions that suppress religious

practice,  coordinating  with  governments  around  the  world  to  promote  reli-
gious  freedom  for  citizens  of  every  faith,  and  expanding  training  for  our 
diplomats  on  how  to  monitor  and  advocate  for  this  freedom.  All  people 
deserve  the  fundamental  dignity  of  practicing  their  faith  free  from  fear, 
intimidation, and violence. 
On Religious Freedom Day, let us recommit ourselves to protecting religious 
minorities  here  at  home  and  around  the  world.  May  we  remember  those 
who  have  been  persecuted,  tortured,  or  murdered  for  their  faith  and  reject 
any  politics  that  targets  people  because  of  their  religion,  including  any 
suggestion  that  our  laws,  policies,  or  practices  should  single  out  certain 
faiths  for  disfavored  treatment.  And  as  one  Nation,  let  us  state  clearly 
and  without  equivocation  that  an  attack  on  any  faith  is  an  attack  on  every 
faith and come together to promote religious freedom for all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  16,  2016 
as  Religious  Freedom  Day.  I  call  on  all  Americans  to  commemorate  this 
day  with  events  and  activities  that  teach  us  about  this  critical  foundation 
of  our  Nation’s  liberty,  and  that  show  us  how  we  can  protect  it  for  future 
generations at home and around the world. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  fifteenth  day 
of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9435  of  April  29,  2016 

National  Building  Safety  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Buildings across our country provide safety and shelter to our people. From 
high-rises  that  form  our  cities’  skylines  to  ranch  homes  that  blanket  the 
countryside, our buildings offer places to gather and perform daily activities, 
and  they  must  have  sound,  secure,  and  resilient  structures.  During  National 
Building  Safety  Month,  we  recognize  and  pay  tribute  to  those  who  ensure 
the  safety  and  resilience  of  our  Nation’s  buildings,  and  we  reaffirm  our 
commitment  to  upholding  and  abiding  by  strong  and  effective  building 
safety standards. 
Maintaining the safety and resilience of our homes and buildings is impera-
tive.  By  using  disaster-resistant  building  codes  and  standards,  resilient  con-
struction  materials,  and  safe  and  performance-based  design  methods,  we 
can  safeguard  the  workplaces,  houses,  schools,  and  other  facilities  that  pro-
vide  us  with  space  to  grow,  live,  and  learn.  Americans  can  also  take  steps 
to  secure  buildings  before  natural  disasters  strike  by  elevating  properties 
where  necessary,  anchoring  furniture  and  other  materials,  reinforcing  doors, 
and  covering  windows.  I  encourage  everyone  to  visit  www.Ready.gov  to 
learn  about  more  ways  to  keep  yourself  and  those  around  you  safe  in 
your homes and businesses. 
The  Federal  Government  is  leading  by  example.  To  prepare  for  natural 
disasters,  I  have  signed  Executive  Orders  that  strengthen  the  security  of 
Federal  buildings  and  assets  and  improve  their  resilience  to  floods  and 
earthquakes,  reduce  the  risks  of  harm  to  people,  lower  recovery  costs,  and 
make  it  easier  for  communities  to  recover  faster  and  emerge  stronger.  Later 
this  month,  the  White  House  will  bring  together  collaborators  from  the 
public  and  private  sectors  at  a  Conference  on  Resilient  Building  Codes. 
This  event  will  underscore  the  critical  role  building  codes  play  in  ensuring 
community  resilience,  and  it  will  strengthen  our  national  commitment  to 
advancing  resilience  in  the  built  environment,  from  codes  and  standards 
to building design and construction. 
The  consequences  of  natural  disasters  can  be  exacerbated  by  the  effects 
of a changing climate—including through stronger storms and longer wildfire 
seasons—so  it  is  crucial  that  we  ensure  our  buildings  are  resilient  to  the 
impacts of climate change. My Administration has worked with communities 
to build climate-resilient infrastructure to prepare for the impacts of climate 
change  that  we  can  no  longer  prevent,  and  we  are  continuing  to  invest 
in energy efficiency in our buildings. 
All  people  deserve  to  feel  safe  in  the  buildings  we  inhabit  day  in  and 
day  out.  With  care  and  attention,  we  can  secure  and  protect  the  places 
we  spend  time  in.  This  month,  let  us  take  action  to  safeguard  America’s 
homes,  schools,  and  other  buildings,  and  let  us  ensure  those  responsible 
for this important work have the tools and resources they need. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National 
Building Safety Month. I encourage citizens, government agencies, businesses,

how they can contribute to building safety at home and in their communities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth

Proclamation  9416  of  April  1,  2016 

National  Public  Health  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Public  Health  Week,  we  join  together  to  enhance  public 
health—the  foundation  of  our  security  and  well-being—here  at  home  and 
around  the  world.  By  supporting  health  professionals  and  embracing  our 
obligations  to  promote  public  health  and  protect  our  planet,  we  can  uphold 
our  shared  responsibility  to  preserve  the  promise  of  a  happy  and  healthy 
life for our children and grandchildren. 
Ensuring  all  Americans  have  access  to  quality,  affordable  health  insurance 
is  imperative  for  maintaining  our  public  health,  and  I  am  proud  that  6 
years  after  I  signed  it,  the  Affordable  Care  Act  has  extended  the  peace 
of  mind  that  comes  with  health  coverage  to  20  million  Americans.  First 
Lady  Michelle  Obama’s  Let’s  Move!  initiative  is  encouraging  more  physical 
activity and nutritious food choices for our Nation’s youth, engaging parents 
and  kids  in  the  work  of  building  stronger,  healthier  communities.  To  spare 
more  American  families  heartbreak,  I  have  proposed  over  1  billion  dollars 
in  new  funding  to  address  prescription  opioid  abuse  and  heroin  use,  a 
public  health  issue  that  has  taken  a  devastating  toll  on  too  many.  We 
are  also  striving  to  promote  mental  health  as  an  essential  component  of 
overall  health,  helping  ensure  access  to  mental  health  care  and  services 
and  working  to  prevent  suicide.  And  because  public  safety  is  a  critical 
component  of  addressing  public  health,  I  announced  new,  commonsense 
steps  this  year  to  help  address  our  country’s  epidemic  of  gun  violence 
and keep our neighborhoods safe. 
Just  as  we  must  sustain  a  healthy  world  today,  we  must  do  everything 
in  our  power  to  preserve  it  for  those  who  will  inherit  it.  Climate  change 
has  a  profound  impact  on  our  public  health,  contributing  to  intensified 
smog,  an  extended  allergy  season,  the  spread  of  diseases  into  new  regions, 
and greater and more acute incidence of asthma. Last year, the White House 
hosted  a  Summit  on  Climate  Change  and  Health  to  expand  awareness  of 
the  real  threat  a  changing  climate  poses  to  our  health  and  to  focus  on 
vulnerable groups who may face more serious challenges adapting to climate 
change. No community is immune to this reality, nor can any nation cordon 
itself  off  from  climate  or  the  air  we  share.  That  is  why  last  year,  along 
with nearly 200 countries from around the world, the United States negotiated 
the Paris Agreement—the most ambitious climate change agreement in history 
that  commits  all  participating  parties  to  putting  forward  climate  targets 
of  growing  stringency  to  reduce  global  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Adopting 
this  agreement  for  an  international  framework  builds  on  domestic  actions 
we have already taken to invest in clean energy, reduce our carbon emissions, 
and transition to a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future. 
Like the threat of climate change, other public health challenges—like infec-
tious diseases—cannot be addressed by any one nation alone. In an increas-
ingly  interconnected  world,  we  face  new  trials  that  demand  international 
attention.  My  Administration  is  working  with  our  international  partners 
to  combat  antibiotic-resistant  bacteria.  We  also  launched  the  Global  Health 
Security  Agenda,  which  aims  to  strengthen  all  countries’  public  health  sys-
tems  and  stop  the  spread  of  disease  outbreaks  by  ensuring  nations  from

biological  threats  to  our  health  and  safety.  Already,  this  cooperation  is 
helping us confront the spread of the Zika virus. 
America  is  built  on  the  notion  that  we  are  our  brothers’  and  our  sisters’ 
keepers,  and  that  we  all  have  certain  obligations  to  one  another.  Never

as  if  they  are  our  own  by  accepting  our  responsibilities  to  leave  them

Nation.

Proclamation  9542  of  November  10,  2016 

National  Apprenticeship  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
When  I  took  office,  our  economy  was  in  freefall—millions  of  Americans 
lost  their  jobs  and  paid  the  price  of  the  worst  recession  of  our  time.  But 
with  grit  and  determination,  our  people  fought  their  way  back  and  began 
working  to  rebuild  an  economy  that  works  for  everyone.  Although  we  have 
added  more  than  15  million  jobs  in  the  last  6  years,  too  many  people 
are  still  feeling  left  behind  in  our  21st-century  economy.  And  because  the 
jobs  of  today  and  tomorrow  require  more  advanced  skills  and  training, 
apprenticeship programs play an increasingly important role in helping peo-
ple  succeed  in  the  workforce.  This  week,  we  celebrate  the  ways  this  job- 
driven  training  model  prepares  Americans  for  meaningful  employment,  and 
we resolve to expand access to this essential pathway to opportunity. 
Registered  apprenticeships  connect  job-seekers  to  better  paying  jobs  that 
are  in  high  demand,  and  by  providing  hands-on  experiences  and  allowing 
Americans  to  earn  while  they  learn,  they  help  workers  gain  the  skills  and 
knowledge necessary to thrive in our modern economy. More than 90 percent 
of  apprentices  find  employment  after  completing  their  programs,  with  grad-
uates earning an average starting salary over $60,000. In addition to benefit-
ting  employees,  apprenticeship  programs  also  help  employers  by  increasing 
productivity  and  innovation  with  a  high  return  on  investment.  A  variety 
of  industries—from  healthcare  to  construction  to  information  technology 
and  advanced  manufacturing—are  using  apprenticeship  programs  to  meet 
their  workforce  needs.  To  bolster  the  competitiveness  of  those  industries 
and others, it is imperative that our Nation continues investing in apprentice-
ship  programs.  Across  our  country,  State  and  local  leaders  have  done  just 
that—in  some  cases  expanding  apprenticeships  by  over  20  percent  in  their 
regions.  And  since  2014,  290  colleges  have  joined  in  the  effort  to  offer 
college credit toward a degree for completing apprenticeship programs. 
My Administration applauds these widespread efforts and remains committed 
to  supporting  apprenticeship  programs.  Two  years  ago,  I  announced  a  goal 
to  double  the  number  of  registered  apprenticeships,  and  with  125,000  more 
active  apprenticeships  today  than  in  2014,  we  have  seen  the  largest  3- 
year increase in nearly a decade. We invested unprecedented levels of Federal 
funding in apprenticeships, including recently awarding more than $50 mil-
lion  in  new  grants  to  States  through  the  ApprenticeshipUSA  initiative.  This 
year, we also invested over $20 million to start new apprenticeship programs 
and  help  historically  underrepresented  individuals—including  women,  mi-
norities,  and  people  with  disabilities—access  apprenticeship  programs.  Last 
year,  I  signed  the  first-ever  annual  Federal  funding  for  apprenticeship  pro-
grams into law, and I will keep calling on the Congress to continue funding 
these  efforts  so  that  this  work  is  carried  forward  for  years  to  come.  And 
because those who have served our country in uniform deserve every oppor-
tunity  to  enjoy  the  American  dream  they  helped  defend,  we  are  working 
to  provide  assistance  to  service  members  and  veterans  who  seek  to  enter 
registered apprenticeship programs. 
During  National  Apprenticeship  Week,  employers,  sponsors,  and  leaders 
across  our  country  will  host  open  houses  to  highlight  the  significant  value

of  apprenticeships  in  our  economy.  Let  us  encourage  more  employers  to 
offer—and  more  workers  to  take  advantage  of—these  indispensable  learning 
and  training  opportunities,  and  together  let  us  continue  working  to  equip 
the  American  workforce  to  meet  the  demands  of  an  ever  changing  future 
so  it  is  filled  with  prosperity  and  opportunity  for  all  who  are  willing  to 
work for it. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

November  19,  2016,  as  National  Apprenticeship  Week.  I  urge  the  Congress, 
State  and  local  governments,  educational  institutions,  industry  and  labor 
leaders, and all Americans to support apprenticeship programs in the United 
States and to raise awareness of their contributions to our country.

Proclamation  9393  of  January  29,  2016 

National  Teen  Dating  Violence  Awareness  and  Prevention 
Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Teen  dating  violence  is  a  serious  violation  that  can  affect  a  young  person’s 
safety,  development,  and  sense  of  comfort.  Perpetrated  by  a  current  or  past 
intimate  partner,  dating  violence  takes  many  forms,  including  physical,  sex-
ual,  or  emotional  abuse,  and  can  occur  in  person  or  through  electronic 
communication  and  social  media.  Violent  dating  relationships  can  lead  to 
depression,  anxiety,  drug  and  alcohol  use,  and  thoughts  of  suicide,  and 
victims  may  continue  to  experience  detrimental  effects  throughout  their 
lives.  During  National  Teen  Dating  Violence  Awareness  and  Prevention 
Month,  we  recognize  the  urgency  needed  in  addressing  this  problem  and 
recommit  to  preventing  it  by  educating  our  youth  about  its  dangers  and 
consequences,  and  reaffirm  the  basic  human  right  to  be  free  from  violence 
and abuse. 
Dating  violence  may  include  physical  force,  such  as  kicking,  hitting,  and 
shoving;  emotional  abuse,  consistent  monitoring,  and  isolation;  or  sexual 
assault.  Dating  violence  can  occur  in  any  relationship,  whether  it  is  casual 
and  short-term  or  long-term  and  monogamous,  and  any  young  person  can 
experience dating violence or other unhealthy relationship behaviors—regard-
less  of  gender,  race,  religion,  ethnicity,  sexual  orientation,  or  socioeconomic 
status. Approximately 1 in 10 teenagers reports being physically or sexually 
victimized  by  a  dating  partner,  and  too  many  other  victims  do  not  report 
it.  The  cycle  of  violence  can  begin  with  anyone  at  any  time,  and  as  a 
society,  we  must  acknowledge  that  we  each  have  a  role  to  play  in  teaching 
children  about  healthy  relationships.  In  their  formative  years,  teens  are 
influenced by their early relationships, and the example set by those around 
them can have lasting consequences. 
My  Administration  is  working  diligently  to  address  teen  dating  violence 
in  a  number  of  ways.  Vice  President  Joe  Biden’s  1is2many  initiative  is 
strengthening efforts to reduce dating violence among those most vulnerable, 
particularly  young  women  between  the  ages  of  16  and  24,  and  is  utilizing 
technology  to  engage  students,  teens,  and  young  adults  in  this  cause.  To 
build  on  our  efforts,  I  established  the  White  House  Task  Force  to  Protect 
Students  from  Sexual  Assault.  The  Task  Force  will,  in  addition  to  working 
to  combat  sexual  violence  on  college  campuses,  explore  ways  its  rec-
ommendations  may  apply  to  elementary  and  secondary  schools  across  our 
country. My Administration will keep forging a future in which no teenager 
must suffer due to having an abusive partner. 
All  Americans  have  a  role  to  play  in  ending  dating  violence  and  fostering 
safe,  healthy  environments  for  our  young  people.  This  month,  let  us  seize 
our  responsibility  to  set  positive  examples  for  our  Nation’s  teenagers  by 
celebrating  and  demonstrating  healthy  relationships,  and  let  us  recommit 
to  ensuring  all  people  who  may  be  in  an  abusive  relationship  have  access 
to  help  and  support.  Together,  we  can  reach  a  day  when  no  young  person 
knows the pain caused by dating violence. 
If  you  or  someone  you  know  is  involved  in  an  abusive  relationship  of 
any  kind,  you  can  get  immediate  and  confidential  support  by  calling

Proclamation  9401  of  February  29,  2016 

National  Colorectal  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

I  urge  all  people 

for  battling  colorectal  cancer. 

A  Proclamation 
Every  year,  more  than  130,000  Americans  are  diagnosed  with  colorectal 
cancer,  and  it  kills  nearly  50,000—making  it  the  second  leading  cause  of 
cancer  deaths  in  the  United  States.  Colorectal  cancer  touches  too  many, 
and  together,  we  must  work  to  lift  up  those  who  have  been  affected  by 
it  and  all  who  remain  vulnerable  to  it.  This  month,  as  we  remember  the 
loved  ones  we  have  lost  and  lift  up  those  who  continue  to  fight  colorectal 
cancer,  we  strive  to  save  lives  by  raising  awareness  of  this  disease  and 
encouraging everyone to take measures to prevent it. 
Although  age,  obesity,  and  certain  genetic  mutations  can  increase  risk  of 
colorectal  cancer,  all  Americans  should  be  aware  of  its  risk  factors,  which 
include  being  physically  inactive,  having  an  unhealthy  diet,  smoking  ciga-
rettes, and consuming alcohol in excess. People who have had inflammatory 
bowel  disease  or  who  have  a  family  history  of  colorectal  cancer  may  also 
be  at  particularly  high  risk.  While  people  of  all  ages  should  consult  a 
physician  about  their  susceptibility,  individuals  between  ages  50  and  75 
are  encouraged  to  get  regular  screenings.  Symptoms  such  as  blood  in  stool, 
persistent  stomach  pains,  and  inexplicable  weight  loss  can  be  present,  but 
sometimes  no  symptoms  occur,  which  is  why  early  detection  and  treatment 
are  key 
to  visit 
www.Cancer.gov  for  more  information,  including  early  warning  signs  and 
tips for prevention. 
I  am  committed  to  combating  all  forms  of  cancer—including  colorectal  can-
cer—and to reaching a future when no family knows the pain cancer causes. 
Earlier  this  year,  I  announced  a  new  initiative  led  by  Vice  President  Joe 
Biden:  a  national  effort  to  put  the  United  States  on  a  path  to  becoming 
the  country  that  finally  cures  cancer  once  and  for  all—aiming  within  5 
years  to  make  critical  advances  that  may  have  otherwise  taken  more  than 
a  decade  to  achieve.  And  we  have  already  proposed  a  $1  billion  initiative 
to  kick  off  this  critical  work.  The  Affordable  Care  Act  now  requires  health 
care  plans  to  cover  certain  recommended  preventive  services,  including 
many screening tests for cancer, at no additional cost—an important provision 
that  helps  ensure  more  people  can  access  critical  tests.  It  also  prohibits 
insurance companies from charging more for pre-existing conditions, includ-
ing  cancer.  While  work  remains  to  be  done  to  confront  the  challenges 
posed  by  colorectal  cancer,  we  have  made  great  progress  in  fighting  it 
and informing people of its dangers. 
All  people  deserve  to  lead  long,  happy,  and  healthy  lives,  and  nobody 
should be robbed of that promise due to the devastating impacts of colorectal 
cancer.  During  National  Colorectal  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  let  us  honor 
the  legacy  of  those  we  have  lost  to  this  cancer  by  spreading  awareness 
of  it,  uplifting  all  who  live  with  it,  and  pledging  our  full  talent,  resources, 
and will to defeating it. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2016  as

Proclamation  9451  of  May  20,  2016 

National  Safe  Boating  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Each  year,  as  summer  approaches  and  warmer  weather  draws  crowds  to 
our  Nation’s  beaches,  lakes,  and  rivers,  we  set  aside  a  week  to  recognize 
the  importance  of  taking  boating  safety  precautions  before  taking  to  the 
water. Throughout National Safe Boating Week, we recognize the risks associ-
ated  with  one  of  our  country’s  favorite  pastimes  and  encourage  everyone 
to apply safe boating practices. 
Safe  boating  practices  should  be  observed  prior  to  leaving  land—no  matter 
the  length  of  the  trip,  the  type  of  boat,  or  the  size  of  the  body  of  water. 
Boaters  can  reduce  risks  and  enhance  their  safety  by  enrolling  in  a  boating 
safety  course.  Vessels  should  be  thoroughly  examined,  float  plans  should 
be  prepared,  and  current  laws  and  regulations  should  be  known  prior  to 
embarking  on  a  journey  on  the  water.  I  encourage  everyone  to  visit 
www.USCGBoating.org to find resources, learn more about responsible boat-
ing,  or  apply  for  a  free  vessel  safety  check.  When  boat  operators  and  their 
passengers exercise caution when boating—including by wearing life jackets 
at  all  times  and  avoiding  consumption  of  drugs  and  alcohol—accidents 
can  be  avoided,  lives  can  be  saved,  and  everyone  can  have  a  safe  and 
enjoyable experience. 
This  week,  we  also  recognize  the  men  and  women  of  the  United  States 
Coast  Guard  who  dedicate  themselves  to  protecting  our  Nation’s  waterways 
and assisting those at sea. As we continue to take advantage of our country’s 
beautiful  bodies  of  water,  let  us  recommit  to  ensuring  water  safety  and 
exercising appropriate boating procedures. 
In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  safe  boating  practices,  the  Congress, 
by  joint  resolution  approved  June  4,  1958  (36  U.S.C.  131),  as  amended, 
has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to  proclaim  annually  the  7- 
day period prior to Memorial Day weekend as ‘‘National Safe Boating Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  21  through  May  27,  2016,  as  National 
Safe  Boating  Week.  I  encourage  all  Americans  who  participate  in  boating 
activities  to  observe  this  occasion  by  learning  more  about  safe  boating  prac-
tices and taking advantage of boating education.

Proclamation  9524  of  October  14,  2016 

National  Forest  Products  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Filtering  the  air  we  breathe  and  the  water  we  drink,  and  providing  the 
habitats  that  are  home  to  diverse  species  of  fish  and  wildlife,  forests  are 
an  essential  part  of  our  planet.  Across  America,  they  offer  a  wide  range 
of  cultural  and  recreational  activities  that  have  sustained  and  entertained 
people since long before our Nation’s founding. Today, forests provide prod-
ucts  we  use  each  day,  including  paper,  wood,  and  building  and  packaging 
materials. During National Forest Products Week, we express our appreciation 
for  the  incredible  bounty  forests  provide  and  we  renew  our  commitment 
to ensuring the next generation can enjoy their irreplaceable resources. 
Our forests are at increasing risk from catastrophic wildfires, erosion, drought, 
and  climate  change.  That  is  why  my  Administration  is  working  alongside 
State  and  local  leaders,  landowners,  and  businesses  to  develop  solutions 
to preserve our forests—because we must respond to challenges that threaten 
these important spaces. America’s forests play an important role in addressing 
climate  change  by  absorbing  carbon  pollution.  It  is  critical  that  we  protect 
and restore our forests, and through the Climate Action Plan, Federal agencies 
are  coming  together  to  strengthen  the  resilience  of  our  forests  and  enhance 
their ability to absorb even more carbon pollution. 
The  health  and  well-being  of  our  forests  and  our  communities  go  hand 
in  hand.  With  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  we  are  working  to  strengthen 
markets for forest products. By allocating millions of dollars to help expand 
technologies  that  encourage  the  use  of  wood  in  innovative  ways,  we  are 
also  striving  to  improve  forest  health  and  generate  rural  jobs.  And  we  are 
exploring ways to help forestland owners respond to climate change—earlier 
this  year,  we  released  a  roadmap  for  implementing  key  building  blocks 
to achieve this goal, such as private forest growth and retention, stewardship 
of Federal forests, and promotion of wood products. 
Forests  generate  billions  of  dollars  in  economic  growth,  sustaining  local 
economies and enhancing communities across our country. We rely on them 
in  so  many  aspects  of  our  national  life,  and  throughout  this  week,  we 
must  continue  working  to  protect  the  precious  resources  our  forests  hold 
so  they  can  continue  enriching  our  world  and  supporting  our  way  of  life. 
To  recognize  the  importance  of  products  from  our  forests,  the  Congress, 
by  Public  Law  86–753  (36  U.S.C.  123),  as  amended,  has  designated  the 
week  beginning  on  the  third  Sunday  in  October  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National 
Forest  Products  Week’’  and  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President 
to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  16  through  October  22,  2016,  as 
National  Forest  Products  Week.  I  call  on  the  people  of  the  United  States 
to  join  me  in  recognizing  the  dedicated  individuals  who  are  responsible 
for  the  stewardship  of  our  forests  and  for  the  preservation,  management, 
and  use  of  these  precious  natural  resources  for  the  benefit  of  the  American 
people.

Proclamation  9521  of  October  7,  2016 

General  Pulaski  Memorial  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Over  two  centuries  ago,  Polish  immigrant  Casimir  Pulaski  crossed  an  ocean 
to  take  up  the  cause  of  defending  a  young  nation.  Rising  quickly  to  the 
rank of Brigadier General in the Continental Army, he reformed our cavalry, 
saved  the  life  of  General  George  Washington,  and  helped  secure  our  inde-
pendence.  Today,  we  celebrate  the  legacy  of  liberty  he  forged  and  reflect 
on  the  many  ways  Polish-American  voices  continue  to  shape  the  unending 
story of our Nation. 
Spending  his  formative  years  in  Poland  laboring  for  his  home  country’s 
independence,  General  Pulaski  came  to  America  with  both  an  expertise 
in  combat  and  a  passion  for  liberty  that  made  him  invaluable  to  our  new 
Nation’s fight for freedom. Leading a legion of men on horseback and working 
alongside General Washington, General Pulaski achieved victory after victory. 
But  he  would  never  see  the  results  of  his  valiant  efforts  fully  realized— 
he  succumbed  to  battle  injuries  on  October  11,  1779,  giving  his  final  full 
measure of devotion in defense of the ideals we cherish. 
More  than  200  years  later,  Polish  Americans  across  our  country  honor  the 
spirit  of  General  Pulaski  through  their  many  contributions  to  our  Nation 
and  through  living  the  values  that  unite  us  all.  The  proud  members  of 
the Polish-American community strengthen the rich heritage of our country— 
many  serve  in  our  Armed  Forces,  protecting  the  very  freedoms  General 
Pulaski helped secure centuries before—and they reflect the strong friendship 
that endures today between the United States and Poland. 
On  General  Pulaski  Memorial  Day,  we  commemorate  one  of  our  Nation’s 
earliest  embodiments  of  the  belief  that  no  matter  who  you  are  or  where 
you  come  from,  those  who  love  this  country  can  change  it  for  the  better. 
In honor of General Pulaski’s sacrifice and the important role Polish Ameri-
cans  play  in  our  country,  let  us  rededicate  ourselves  to  defending  our 
founding ideal of liberty for all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  11,  2016, 
as General Pulaski Memorial Day. I encourage all Americans to commemorate 
this  occasion  with  appropriate  programs  and  activities  paying  tribute  to 
Casimir  Pulaski  and  honoring  all  those  who  defend  the  freedom  of  our 
Nation.

Proclamation  9501  of  September  23,  2016 

National  Public  Lands  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Nothing  can  truly  capture  the  beauty  and  majesty  of  America’s  expansive 
landscapes  and  wide-open  acres.  On  National  Public  Lands  Day,  Americans 
from  coast-to-coast  celebrate  these  spaces  by  participating  in  the  largest 
single-day  volunteer  effort  to  restore  and  enhance  the  lands  we  all  enjoy. 
Volunteers  will  remove  litter  and  invasive  plant  species,  blaze  new  trails 
and  maintain  existing  ones,  and  plant  seeds  that  will  grow  in  the  years 
to  come—taking  full  advantage  of  the  chance  to  give  back  to  the  lands 
that have given us all so much. 

Our  public  lands  reflect  our  shared  history,  and  enable  us  to  connect  to 
each  other  and  to  something  bigger  than  ourselves.  National  Parks,  forests, 
wildlife  refuges,  conservation  lands,  and  marine  sanctuaries  not  only 
strengthen  our  economy  through  tourism  and  provide  endless  recreational 
and  educational  opportunities,  but  are  also  home  to  important  biodiversity 
and  rich  ecosystems.  I  am  proud  that  my  Administration  has  protected 
hundreds  of  millions  of  acres  of  these  vital  lands  and  waters—more  than 
any Administration in history. Through the America’s Great Outdoors Initia-
tive, we have also promoted innovative, community-level efforts to conserve 
outdoor  spaces  and  reconnect  Americans  with  nature.  And  through  the 
21st  Century  Conservation  Corps,  we  have  worked  to  inspire  millions  of 
young adults and veterans to engage in hands-on service in the great outdoors. 

On  National  Public  Lands  Day,  all  federally  managed  public  lands  and 
waters  are  offering  free  admission  so  Americans  can  observe  this  day  not 
just  by  caring  for  these  spaces,  but  by  enjoying  their  vast  wonders.  To 
ensure  more  young  people  can  discover  our  great  outdoors,  my  ‘‘Every 
Kid  in  a  Park’’  initiative  is  again  giving  fourth  grade  students  and  their 
families  free  access  to  all  National  Parks  and  other  Federal  lands  for  an 
entire  year.  And  as  the  National  Park  Service  celebrates  100  years  of  pre-
serving  and  protecting  these  important  spaces,  we  are  encouraging  more 
Americans  to  ‘‘Find  Your  Park’’  and  explore  the  extraordinary  parks  and 
public lands in their communities. 

As  stewards  of  our  environment  and  caretakers  of  these  public  lands,  we 
must  build  on  our  legacy  of  conservation.  Climate  change  poses  the  single 
biggest  threat  to  our  natural  resources.  Across  our  country,  we  are  experi-
encing  stronger  storms,  harsher  droughts,  increased  flooding,  and  longer 
wildfire  seasons  that  put  these  public  spaces  at  risk—which  is  why  any 
effort  to  fully  combat  climate  change  must  include  protecting  our  land, 
water,  and  wildlife.  Let  us  rededicate  ourselves  to  this  critical  work  and 
continue  looking  after  these  natural  treasures  and  protecting  our  historic 
and cultural heritage for generations to come. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  24,  2016, 
as  National  Public  Lands  Day.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  participate 
in a day of public service for our lands.

Proclamation  9528  of  October  21,  2016 

United  Nations  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Seventy-one  years  ago,  after  rolling  back  a  tide  of  tyranny  that  threatened 
Europe  and  the  world,  members  of  the  international  community  came  to-
gether  to  sign  the  United  Nations  Charter—advancing  a  promise  to  replace 
the  ravages  of  war  with  the  possibilities  of  diplomacy.  On  United  Nations 
Day,  we  reflect  on  the  progress  we  have  made  in  the  time  since,  resolve 
to carry this progress forward, and reaffirm our commitment to international 
cooperation  rooted  in  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of  nations  across  the 
globe. 
Today,  because  of  the  international  order  the  United  Nations  has  helped 
anchor  for  more  than  seven  decades,  we  live  in  a  global  community  that, 
together, has overcome the greatest financial crisis of our time, lifted billions 
of  people  out  of  poverty,  promoted  the  emergence  of  more  democracies, 
and  taken  meaningful  steps  toward  leaving  our  children  with  a  world  that 
is  safer,  cleaner,  and  more  stable.  Yet  the  same  forces  of  integration  that 
have  helped  forge  closer  ties  and  stronger  partnerships  among  the  world’s 
nations  also  have  exposed  deep  fault  lines  that  we  must  address.  In  too 
many  places  around  the  world,  perpetrators  of  atrocities  go  unpunished 
and  those  who  violate  international  law  face  no  consequences.  Climate 
change remains a serious threat—even after we officially crossed the thresh-
old  for  the  Paris  Agreement  to  take  effect  earlier  this  month.  Too  many 
governments  still  silence  journalists,  quash  dissent,  and  censor  vital  flows 
of  information.  And  in  camps  and  cities  around  the  world,  families  live 
as  refugees,  surviving  on  aid  and  the  compassion  of  others.  These  issues 
present  crises  of  our  shared  security  and  challenges  to  our  international 
system  in  which  all  nations  must  share  in  our  collective  responsibilities. 
Our  world  is  too  small,  and  our  destinies  too  intertwined,  for  us  not  to 
see  ourselves  in  one  another.  By  upholding  the  values  upon  which  the 
United Nations was founded—pluralism, diversity, human rights, and togeth-
erness—we  can  ensure  we  pass  these  tests  of  our  common  humanity.  And 
by  continuing  to  build  a  more  capable  and  effective  United  Nations,  we 
strengthen  the  world’s  capacity  to  respond  to  global  crises,  keep  peace 
in fragile societies, and tackle unprecedented humanitarian challenges. 
The  international  community  relies  on  the  United  Nations  today  more  than 
ever  before.  Now  in  its  eighth  decade,  this  institution—and  those  selfless 
individuals  who  devote  their  lives  to  sustaining  it—is  vital  to  our  mission 
of  shaping  a  better  world:  one  defined  by  cooperation  over  confrontation, 
a  shared  sense  of  purpose,  and  the  understanding  that  the  future  of  a 
child  in  America  is  inextricably  linked  to  that  of  a  child  in  Afghanistan. 
On this day, let us pay tribute to the staff of the United Nations, particularly 
the  more  than  100,000  uniformed  personnel  serving  in  peacekeeping  mis-
sions, for their selfless service to the cause of promoting international peace 
and prosperity, and as citizens of the world, let us renew our shared commit-
ment to forging a brighter tomorrow for all. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  24,  2016,

Proclamation  9433  of  April  28,  2016 

National  Mental  Health  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Nearly  44  million  American  adults,  and  millions  of  children,  experience 
mental  health  conditions  each  year,  including  depression,  anxiety,  bipolar 
disorder,  schizophrenia,  and  post-traumatic  stress.  Although  we  have  made 
progress  expanding  mental  health  coverage  and  elevating  the  conversation 
about  mental  health,  too  many  people  still  do  not  get  the  help  they  need. 
Our Nation is founded on the belief that we must look out for one another— 
and  whether  it  affects  our  family  members,  friends,  co-workers,  or  those 
unknown  to  us—we  do  a  service  for  each  other  when  we  reach  out  and 
help  those  struggling  with  mental  health  issues.  This  month,  we  renew 
our commitment to ridding our society of the stigma associated with mental 
illness,  encourage  those  living  with  mental  health  conditions  to  get  the 
help  they  need,  and  reaffirm  our  pledge  to  ensure  those  who  need  help 
have access to the support, acceptance, and resources they deserve. 
In the last 7 years, our country has made extraordinary progress in expanding 
mental  health  coverage  for  more  people  across  America.  The  Affordable 
Care  Act  prohibits  insurance  companies  from  discriminating  against  people 
based  on  pre-existing  conditions,  requires  coverage  of  mental  health  and 
substance  use  disorder  services  in  individual  and  small  group  markets, 
and expands mental health and substance use disorder parity policies, which 
are  estimated  to  help  more  than  60  million  Americans.  Nearly  15  million 
more Americans have gained Medicaid coverage since October 2013, signifi-
cantly  improving  access  to  mental  health  care.  And  because  of  more  than 
$100  million  in  funding  from  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  community  health 
centers  have  expanded  behavioral  health  services  for  nearly  900,000  people 
nationwide  over  the  past  2  years.  Still,  far  too  few  Americans  experiencing 
mental  illnesses  do  not  receive  the  care  and  treatment  they  need.  That 
is  why  my  most  recent  Budget  proposal  includes  a  new  half-billion  dollar 
investment  to  improve  access  to  mental  health  care,  engage  individuals 
with  serious  mental  illness  in  care,  and  help  ensure  behavioral  health  care 
systems work for everyone. 
Our  Nation  has  made  strong  advances  in  improving  prevention,  increasing 
early  intervention,  and  expanding  treatment  of  mental  illnesses.  Earlier  this 
year,  I  established  a  Mental  Health  and  Substance  Use  Disorder  Parity  Task 
Force,  which  aims  to  ensure  that  coverage  for  mental  health  benefits  is 
comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care, improve understanding 
of  the  requirements  of  the  law,  and  expand  compliance  with  it.  Mental 
health  should  be  treated  as  part  of  a  person’s  overall  health,  and  we  must 
ensure individuals living with mental health conditions can get the treatment 
they need. My Administration also continues to invest in science and research 
through  the  BRAIN  initiative  to  enhance  our  understanding  of  the  complex-
ities  of  the  human  brain  and  to  make  it  easier  to  diagnose  and  treat  mental 
health disorders early. 
One  of  our  most  profound  obligations  as  a  Nation  is  to  support  the  men 
and  women  in  uniform  who  return  home  and  continue  fighting  battles 
against  mental  illness.  Last  year,  I  signed  the  Clay  Hunt  SAV  Act,  which 
fills  critical  gaps  in  serving  veterans  with  post-traumatic  stress  and  other

illnesses,  increases  peer  support  and  outreach,  and  recruits  more  talented 
individuals  to  work  on  mental  health  issues  at  the  Department  of  Veterans 
Affairs.  This  law  will  make  it  easier  for  veterans  to  get  the  care  they  need 
when  they  need  it.  All  Americans,  including  service  members,  can  get 
immediate  assistance  by  calling  the  National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline 
at 1–800–273–TALK or by calling 1–800–662–HELP. 
During National Mental Health Awareness Month, we recognize those Ameri-
cans  who  live  with  mental  illness  and  substance  use  disorders,  and  we 
pledge  solidarity  with  their  families  who  need  our  support  as  well.  Let 
us  strive  to  ensure  people  living  with  mental  health  conditions  know  that 
they  are  not  alone,  that  hope  exists,  and  that  the  possibility  of  healing 
and  thriving  is  real.  Together,  we  can  help  everyone  get  the  support  they 
need to recover as they continue along the journey to get well. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National 
Mental  Health  Awareness  Month.  I  call  upon  citizens,  government  agencies, 
organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise mental 
health  awareness  and  continue  helping  Americans  live  longer,  healthier 
lives. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-eighth 
day  of  April,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Title  3— 

Proclamation  9427  of  April  27,  2016 

The  President 

National  Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month,  2016 

26089 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For  generations,  sports  have  brought  Americans  of  all  ages  together  and 
helped  us  celebrate  our  country’s  competitive  spirit.  When  we  work  to 
instill  an  appreciation  for  physical  fitness  in  our  people,  we  do  more  than 
honor  an  age-old  tradition—we  take  a  critical  step  toward  ensuring  the 
prospect  of  a  long  and  healthy  life.  During  National  Physical  Fitness  and 
Sports Month, we highlight the importance of staying active, and we encour-
age  all  Americans  to  partake  in  physical  activity  to  maintain  their  health 
and well-being. 
Sports  and  other  forms  of  physical  activity  inspire  us—they  bridge  dif-
ferences, unite Americans from every walk of life, and teach the importance 
of  teamwork.  Whether  exploring  the  great  outdoors  or  shooting  hoops  with 
friends,  regular  physical  activity  can  also  relieve  stress,  boost  energy  and 
self-esteem,  and  prevent  numerous  chronic  diseases,  including  some  of  the 
leading  causes  of  death,  such  as  cancer,  stroke,  and  heart  disease.  Children 
should  engage  in  physical  activity  for  at  least  1  hour  each  day,  and  adults 
should  do  so  for  at  least  30  minutes.  Critical  to  enabling  our  youth  to 
reach  their  fullest  potential,  regular  exercise  must  go  hand-in-hand  with 
healthy eating and proper nutrition—because our children’s well-being tomor-
row depends on what they eat today. 
This  year,  we  celebrate  six  decades  since  President  Dwight  Eisenhower 
established  the  President’s  Council  on  Youth  Fitness,  known  today  as  the 
President’s  Council  on  Fitness,  Sports,  and  Nutrition.  The  Council  partners 
with  the  public,  private,  and  non-profit  sectors  to  empower  people  to  lead 
healthy and active lives. Through their I Can Do It, You Can Do It! program, 
the  Council  facilitates  physical  activity  for  individuals  with  disabilities  and 
offers  opportunities  for  regular  exercise  at  sites  across  our  country.  My 
Administration’s Go4Life campaign is motivating older Americans to recom-
mit  to  making  exercise  a  part  of  their  daily  lives.  And  First  Lady  Michelle 
Obama’s  Let’s  Move!  initiative  continues  to  inspire  a  rising  generation  to 
eat  healthily  and  get  plenty  of  physical  activity  so  they  can  grow  up  strong 
and  pursue  their  dreams.  For  more  information  on  my  Administration’s 
actions  to  promote  sports  and  physical  fitness—and  for  ways  you  can  get 
involved—visit www.Fitness.gov and www.LetsMove.gov. 
Participation  in  sports  and  other  physical  activity  represents  our  country’s 
promise:  the  idea  that  if  you  work  hard,  commit  to  a  goal,  and  never 
give  up  on  yourself,  there  is  nothing  you  cannot  achieve.  This  month, 
let  us  each  strive  to  make  fitness  a  greater  part  of  our  lives,  and  let  us 
join  together  as  one  American  team  to  promote  physical  activity  and  chart 
a healthier, fitter future for our country. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2016 as National 
Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United 
States to make daily physical activity, sports participation, and good nutrition 
a priority in their lives.

Proclamation  9480  of  August  31,  2016 

National  Childhood  Obesity  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Childhood  obesity  has  both  immediate  and  long-term  effects  on  a  child’s 
health  and  well-being—it  puts  our  young  people  at  higher  risk  for  health 
problems  in  adulthood  and  it  can  strain  our  economy  in  the  years  ahead. 
But collaborative efforts in recent years have helped our Nation make progress 
and  begin  to  reverse  these  trends.  By  fostering  environments  that  support 
healthy  choices  and  giving  families  the  knowledge  and  resources  they  need 
to make smart decisions, we can move closer toward ensuring all our children 
grow  up  healthy.  Every  September,  as  children  begin  the  new  school  year, 
we  recommit  to  solving  the  epidemic  of  childhood  obesity  within  the  next 
generation. 
Over  the  course  of  my  Presidency,  we  have  put  forward  new  programs, 
policies,  and  initiatives  that  put  children  on  a  path  to  a  healthy  future. 
At the launch of First Lady Michelle Obama’s Let’s Move! initiative, I estab-
lished  the  first-ever  Task  Force  on  Childhood  Obesity  to  develop  a  national 
action  plan  to  mobilize  the  public  and  private  sectors  and  engage  families 
and  communities  in  an  effort  to  improve  the  health  of  our  children.  Com-
bining  comprehensive  strategies  with  common  sense,  Let’s  Move!  is  focused 
on  helping  children  lead  a  healthier  life  during  their  earliest  months  and 
years;  providing  healthier  foods  in  our  schools;  ensuring  every  family  has 
access  to  healthy,  affordable  food;  and  getting  children  to  become  more 
physically  active.  Everyone  has  a  role  to  play  in  ensuring  all  of  our  kids 
grow  up  healthy,  including  parents  and  caregivers,  elected  officials  from 
all  levels  of  government,  schools,  health  care  professionals,  faith-based  and 
community-based  organizations,  and  the  private  sector.  For  the  past  5  years 
we  have  welcomed  students  to  the  White  House  from  across  our  Nation 
to  create  original  and  healthy  recipes  in  our  annual  Healthy  Lunchtime 
Challenge and Kids’ ‘‘State Dinner.’’ The First Lady has also invited students 
to  join  her  in  planting  and  harvesting  the  White  House  Kitchen  Garden 
to  learn  about  where  their  food  comes  from  and  experience  firsthand  how 
healthy food can be fun and delicious. 
Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration introduced a modernized 
Nutrition Facts label—which includes more realistic serving sizes and infor-
mation  on  added  sugars—to  provide  families  with  the  accurate  information 
they  need  to  make  healthy  choices.  We  know  there  is  a  strong  connection 
between  what  our  kids  eat  and  how  well  they  perform  in  school,  too. 
That  is  why,  in  2010,  I  signed  the  bipartisan  Healthy,  Hunger-Free  Kids 
Act,  a  law  that  improves  the  quality  of  school  meals  and  snacks  for  over 
50  million  students  so  they  have  the  fuel  they  need  to  focus  on  their 
education  and  grow  up  healthy.  A  recent  study  showed  that  because  of 
the  increased  availability  and  variety  of  fruits  and  vegetables  in  school 
meals, students have been empowered to make healthier choices since these 
standards  were  updated.  The  Act  increased  the  number  of  students  who 
could  get  school  meals  at  little  or  no  cost  and  ensured  that  any  food 
or beverage marketed to children at school meets specific nutrition standards. 
It  also  helped  bring  about  the  first  major  revision  of  nutrition  standards 
for  the  Child  and  Adult  Care  Food  Program  since  its  inception  more  than 
40 years ago.

In  addition  to  improving  the  nutrition  of  the  food  our  children  eat,  we 
will keep striving to create opportunities for kids to become more physically 
active. The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend that kids 
be  active  for  at  least  60  minutes  every  day,  but  less  than  one-third  of 
teenagers  have  met  that  goal  in  recent  years.  Last  year,  the  Surgeon  General 
called  on  communities  to  recognize  the  importance  of  exercise  by  walking 
more  and  by  improving  the  walkability  of  our  neighborhoods.  Through  our 
‘‘Every  Kid  in  a  Park’’  initiative,  we  have  opened  up  our  National  Parks 
to  fourth  graders  and  their  families  for  free,  so  that  children  from  all  back-
grounds,  parts  of  the  country,  and  walks  of  life  can  get  outdoors  more 
easily. 
This  year,  as  we  observe  National  Childhood  Obesity  Awareness  Month, 
let  us  renew  our  commitment  to  giving  America’s  daughters  and  sons  a 
healthy  start  in  life.  Let  us  continue  to  encourage  parents  and  caregivers 
to  make  nutritious  choices  and  help  their  children  do  the  same,  improve 
access  to  healthy  and  affordable  foods  in  our  communities  and  our  schools, 
and promote active lifestyles. We must each do our part to reduce childhood 
obesity  and  empower  our  children  to  reach  for  the  brighter,  healthier  future 
they deserve. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  2016 
as National Childhood Obesity Awareness Month. I encourage all Americans 
to  learn  about  and  engage  in  activities  that  promote  healthy  eating  and 
greater physical activity by all our Nation’s children. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9508  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Cybersecurity  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Technology  plays  an  increasingly  significant  role  in  our  daily  lives.  The 
rise  of  the  Internet  has  brought  incredible  opportunity  and  new  ways  of 
innovating  and  enhancing  our  way  of  life—but  with  great  potential  also 
comes  heightened  risk  to  our  data.  Keeping  cyberspace  secure  is  a  matter 
of  national  security,  and  in  order  to  ensure  we  can  reap  the  benefits  and 
utility  of  technology  while  minimizing  the  dangers  and  threats  it  presents, 
we must continue to make cybersecurity a top priority. Throughout National 
Cybersecurity  Awareness  Month,  we  recognize  the  role  that  individuals  can 
play  in  enhancing  cybersecurity,  and  we  join  to  raise  awareness  of  the 
importance of securing our information against cyber threats. 
To  build  on  the  cybersecurity  efforts  already  underway,  my  Administration 
introduced the Cybersecurity National Action Plan earlier this year to address 
short-term  and  long-term  challenges  when  it  comes  to  cybersecurity.  We 
have  proposed  increasing  the  budget  for  cybersecurity  by  more  than  one- 
third  and  establishing  an  Information  Technology  Modernization  Fund  to 
help retire, replace, and modernize our costly information technology legacy 
systems.  We  are  also  striving  to  invest  in  cybersecurity  education,  reform 
the  way  Government  manages  and  responds  to  large-scale  cyber  threats, 
and update obsolete Federal IT systems that are vulnerable to attack. 
To  meet  these  goals,  we  created  the  position  of  the  first-ever  Federal  Chief 
Information  Security  Officer  to  help  drive  cybersecurity  policy,  planning, 
and  implementation  across  the  Federal  Government.  We  also  established 
the Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity to recommend actions 
that  can  be  taken  over  the  next  decade  to  strengthen  cybersecurity  in  both 
the  public  and  private  sectors  while  protecting  privacy.  This  Commission 
will  maintain  public  safety  and  economic  and  national  security,  foster  dis-
covery and development of new technical solutions, and bolster partnerships 
between  governments  and  the  private  sector  in  an  effort  to  promote  best 
cybersecurity practices. 
Cyber  threats  not  only  pose  a  danger  to  our  national  security,  but  also 
have the potential to harm our financial security and undermine the privacy 
of  millions  of  Americans.  An  important  part  of  enhancing  cybersecurity 
involves  empowering  more  Americans  to  help  themselves  take  proper  pre-
cautions online and in their financial transactions; cybersecurity is a shared 
responsibility,  and  everyone  can  do  their  part  to  make  smart,  safe  choices. 
The  Federal  Government  is  also  doing  our  part  through  the  BuySecure 
Initiative,  which  has  issued  more  than  three  million  more  secure  credit 
cards for Government purchases. We are also working to help give Americans 
earlier  warning  of  identity  crimes  with  free  access  to  credit  scores  through 
their existing consumer accounts. 
Through the Department of Homeland Security’s ‘‘Stop.Think.Connect.’’ cam-
paign,  we  are  aiming  to  increase  awareness  of  the  simple  steps  people 
can take to strengthen their cybersecurity. The National Cyber Security Alli-
ance,  in  partnership  with  the  private  sector  and  non-profit  organizations, 
recently launched the ‘‘Lock Down Your Login’’ campaign to empower Ameri-
cans  to  take  control  of  their  online  accounts  and  add  an  extra  layer  of

security  beyond  just  using  passwords.  I  encourage  every  American  to  take 
this  important  step  and  to  visit  www.LockDownYourLogin.com  to  learn 
more. 
Keeping America safe requires us to bolster our security online. This month, 
we  renew  our  commitment  to  ensuring  our  information  is  more  secure, 
our  data  is  safer,  and  our  families  and  businesses  are  more  protected  than 
ever  before.  If  we  work  toward  this  goal—as  individuals  and  as  a  Nation— 
together we can realize our full potential in the digital age. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Cybersecurity  Awareness  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the 
United  States  to  recognize  the  importance  of  cybersecurity  and  to  observe 
this month with activities, events, and training that will enhance our national 
security and resilience. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirtieth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the

Proclamation  9413  of  March  31,  2016 

National  Financial  Capability  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
When  every  American  has  the  tools  they  need  to  get  ahead  and  contribute 
to  our  country’s  success,  we  are  all  better  off.  Since  the  recession,  we 
have  built  our  economy  to  be  better  and  stronger  than  before,  but  we  still 
have work to do to make hardworking families’ paychecks go further. Ensur-
ing people have the resources to make informed decisions about their finances 
is  critical  in  this  effort,  and  during  National  Financial  Capability  Month, 
we  recommit  to  equipping  individuals  with  the  knowledge  and  protections 
necessary to secure a stable financial future for themselves and their families. 
At  some  of  life’s  most  important  junctures—including  buying  a  home,  pur-
suing an education, or saving for retirement—having access to reliable infor-
mation  about  our  country’s  financial  system  can  help  people  avoid  being 
ripped  off  or  sucked  into  cycles  of  debt  they  cannot  get  out  of.  That  is 
why my Administration is promoting tools to protect and empower individ-
uals,  working  to  increase  borrowers’  understanding  of  what  they  are  getting 
into  before  they  take  out  a  loan,  and  educating  more  people  on  how  to 
think  about  their  money.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  call  1–800–FED– 
INFO or visit www.MyMoney.gov and www.ConsumerFinance.gov for access 
to free and reliable financial information. 
No  young  person  should  be  saddled  with  excessive  debt.  In  addition  to 
striving  to  inform  young  people  of  the  dangers  of  taking  out  too  much 
consumer  debt,  my  Administration  launched  the  ‘‘Know  Before  You  Owe’’ 
campaign, which is helping America’s college students know their full range 
of  options  for  financing  a  higher  education.  I  also  created  the  President’s 
Advisory  Council  on  Financial  Capability  for  Young  Americans  to  help 
educate  our  rising  generation  on  important  money  management  skills  so 
they can live with security and make positive contributions to our economy. 
So  more  of  our  people  can  retire  with  dignity  and  stability,  we  established 
a  new  type  of  savings  bond,  myRA,  to  help  more  Americans  easily  save 
for  retirement.  And  I  signed  the  Dodd-Frank  Wall  Street  Reform  and  Con-
sumer Protection Act, which, among other consumer protections, established 
the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau,  the  first  agency  solely  dedicated 
to  protecting  consumers  from  unfair  practices  and  predatory  products  in 
financial services. 
As  our  economy  continues  to  grow,  we  must  preserve  the  basic  notion 
in  our  country  that  hard  work  will  be  rewarded  and  that  no  matter  who 
you  are  or  where  you  come  from,  you  can  make  it  if  you  try.  This  month, 
let  us  encourage  informed  financial  decisions  and  promote  resources  that 
help  the  American  people  make  them,  and  let  us  reaffirm  our  belief  in 
the  idea  that  opportunity  should  be  within  reach  for  all  who  are  willing 
to work for it. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National 
Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
with  programs  and  activities  to  improve  their  understanding  of  financial 
principles and practices.

The  President 

Proclamation  9487  of  September  9,  2016 

National  Hispanic-Serving  Institutions  Week,  2016 

63351 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Ensuring  opportunity  is  within  reach  for  everyone  requires  us  to  provide 
all  our  people  with  access  to  a  world-class  education.  Higher  education 
gives  people  a  sense  of  who  they  are  and  sharpens  how  they  see  the 
world,  and  in  our  21st-century  economy,  it  is  an  investment  that  pays 
off—helping  Americans  work  their  way  into  the  middle  class.  Across  our 
country,  Hispanic-Serving  Institutions  (HSIs)  have  helped  Hispanic  stu-
dents—many  of  whom  are  the  first  in  their  family  to  go  to  college—earn 
a  college  degree.  This  week,  we  reflect  on  how  these  important  institutions 
have  helped  Hispanic  students  reach  for  their  dreams,  and  we  reaffirm 
our commitment to supporting them for generations to come. 
HSIs  have  given  more  Hispanics  access  to  the  resources  and  opportunities 
they need to compete in our economy. More than half of America’s Hispanic 
undergraduates  attend  HSIs,  which  have  played  a  critical  role  in  increasing 
access  to  a  college  education  and  have  worked  to  bolster  enrollment,  reten-
tion, and graduation rates. In the last several years, college enrollment among 
Hispanics  hit  a  record  high,  and  today,  it  continues  to  grow.  Over  the 
past  two  decades,  the  percentage  of  young  Hispanics  who  have  earned 
a college degree has increased significantly—but in that same time, disparities 
have persisted. HSIs are helping ensure more Hispanics have the opportunity 
to  complete  college,  moving  us  closer  to  our  goal  of  leading  the  world 
in higher education by 2020. 
Hispanics  are  the  largest  and  fastest  growing  minority  group  in  America, 
and  we  must  keep  striving  to  ensure  they  can  pursue  an  exceptional  edu-
cation.  My  Administration  has  sought  to  improve  educational  outcomes 
and opportunities for every American, including Hispanics through the White 
House  Initiative  on  Educational  Excellence  for  Hispanics.  We  have  helped 
strengthen  HSIs,  which  serve  a  higher  proportion  of  low-income  students 
than other institutions of higher education, by investing more than $1 billion 
in  them  over  10  years.  Because  college  has  never  been  more  expensive, 
I  have  also  taken  steps  to  make  it  easier  for  more  Americans  to  pay  for 
higher  education—steps  that  include  expanding  Pell  Grants  and  offering 
tuition  tax  credits.  And  I  am  fighting  for  2  years  of  free  community  college 
for  any  student  willing  to  work  for  it,  because  no  American  should  be 
priced out of a quality education. 
The  contributions  of  Hispanics  have  shaped  our  national  narrative,  and 
it  is  crucial  to  our  success  that  we  empower  more  Hispanics  and  young 
people  across  our  country  to  thrive.  For  generations,  HSIs  have  helped 
Hispanics  earn  college  degrees,  seek  meaningful  careers,  and  aspire  to  be 
anything  they  want.  At  the  heart  of  our  Nation  is  the  idea  that  no  matter 
where  you  come  from  or  what  you  look  like,  if  you  are  willing  to  work 
hard,  you  can  make  it  in  America.  By  expanding  opportunities  for  all, 
we  can  bring  more  people  closer  to  reaching  their  piece  of  the  American 
dream. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 12 through

Proclamation  9387  of  December  31,  2015 

National  Stalking  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  person  deserves  to  live  freely  and  without  the  fear  of  being  followed 
or  harassed.  Stalking  is  a  violation  of  our  fundamental  freedoms,  and  it 
insults  our  most  basic  values  as  a  Nation.  Often  perpetrated  by  those  we 
know—and sometimes by strangers—stalking is a serious offense that occurs 
too  frequently  and  goes  unreported  in  too  many  cases.  During  National 
Stalking  Awareness  Month,  we  stand  with  victims  of  stalking,  pledge  to 
bring  their  stalkers  to  justice,  and  rededicate  our  efforts  to  ridding  our 
schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods of this crime. 
A  repeated  display  of  unwanted  attention  that  instills  fear,  stalking  affects 
people  from  all  walks  of  life  and  makes  us  all  less  safe.  Seven  and  a 
half  million  people  are  stalked  in  the  United  States  each  year,  and  1  in 
6  women  will  experience  it  at  some  point  in  their  lives.  People  are  stalked 
under  a  variety  of  circumstances  and  through  a  number  of  mediums.  Text 
messages,  emails,  and  phone  calls  are  some  of  the  most  common  means 
by  which  a  stalker  will  harass  someone,  and  offenders  usually,  although 
not  always,  have  a  prior  association  with  the  victim.  Often  offenders  are 
or  have  been  in  an  intimate  relationship  in  which  they  have  abused  the 
victim, and in many instances stalking is a part of ongoing violence. Stalking 
is not only a tremendous breach of one’s privacy and liberty, but its purpose 
is to cause victims to feel scared or anxious, terrorizing them and sometimes 
causing  anxiety,  insomnia,  social  dysfunction,  and  depression.  It  also  has 
the  potential  to  cause  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms  such  as  flashbacks, 
nightmares,  and  being  constantly  on  guard.  It  is  an  affront  to  our  basic 
humanity, and in some cases it can lead to more violent acts by the offenders. 
In  2013,  I  signed  the  reauthorization  of  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act 
(VAWA)—a  groundbreaking  law  that  recognizes  stalking  as  the  crime  it 
is and provides more resources to victims. The Act also created new protec-
tions  for  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender  victims,  as  well  as  for 
immigrants  and  Native  American  women.  Earlier  this  year,  I  signed  an 
Executive  Order  that  allows  victims  to  use  sick  leave  for  absences  related 
to  stalking  and  that  protects  victims’  privacy  in  the  workplace.  In  my  2016 
budget,  I  proposed  additional  funding  to  assist  people  being  stalked  who 
must  make  emergency  moves  to  safer  and  more  stable  housing.  And  to 
build on these efforts, my Administration has implemented measures requir-
ing  institutions  of  higher  education  to  collect  and  report  information  on 
stalking and other crimes as outlined in VAWA. Under the new regulations, 
these  institutions  are  required  to  make  their  disciplinary  processes  more 
transparent  and  to  provide  ongoing  prevention  and  awareness  campaigns 
for  students  and  employees—because  our  classrooms  should  be  safe  havens 
where  everyone  can  pursue  their  dreams  and  fulfill  their  potential  free 
from the fear of being stalked or harassed. 
As  we  embark  on  a  new  year,  let  us  resolve  to  make  it  one  in  which 
every  person  can  safely  and  confidently  make  of  their  lives  what  they 
will.  By  holding  stalkers  accountable  and  providing  victims  and  survivors 
with  the  support  and  assistance  they  need,  we  can  ensure  ours  is  a  Nation 
dedicated to promoting safety, common decency, and respect.

Notice  of  March  2,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Zimbabwe 

On  March  6,  2003,  by  Executive  Order  13288,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  and  blocked  the  property  of  certain  persons,  pursuant 
to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706), 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  foreign  policy 
of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions  and  policies  of  certain  mem-
bers  of  the  Government  of  Zimbabwe  and  other  persons  to  undermine 
Zimbabwe’s democratic processes or institutions. These actions and policies 
had contributed to the deliberate breakdown in the rule of law in Zimbabwe, 
to  politically  motivated  violence  and  intimidation  in  that  country,  and  to 
political and economic instability in the southern African region. 
On  November  22,  2005,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13391  to 
take  additional  steps  with  respect  to  the  national  emergency  declared  in 
Executive  Order  13288,  including  the  blocking  of  the  property  of  additional 
persons  engaged  in  undermining  democratic  processes  or  institutions  in 
Zimbabwe. 
On  July  25,  2008,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13469,  which  ex-
panded  the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order 
13288  and  authorized  the  blocking  of  the  property  of  additional  persons 
who  were  engaged  in  undermining  democratic  processes  or  institutions  in 
Zimbabwe,  facilitating  public  corruption  by  senior  officials,  or  were  respon-
sible  for  committing  human  rights  abuses  related  to  political  repression. 
The  actions  and  policies  of  these  persons  continue  to  pose  an  unusual 
and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For 
this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  March  6,  2003,  and  the 
measures  adopted  on  that  date,  on  November  22,  2005,  and  on  July  25, 
2008,  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  March 
6,  2016.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national 
emergency originally declared in Executive Order 13288.

Executive  Order  13812  of  September  29,  2017 

Revocation  of  Executive  Order  Creating  Labor-Management 
Forums 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  The  United  States  Government  should  spend  tax  dollars 
responsibly,  efficiently,  and  in  the  public  interest.  The  National  Council 
on  Federal  Labor-Management  Relations  (Council)  and  related  agency-level 
labor-management forums have consumed considerable managerial time and 
taxpayer resources, but they have not fulfilled their goal of promoting collabo-
ration  in  the  Federal  workforce.  Public  expenditures  on  the  Council  and 
related  forums  have  produced  few  benefits  to  the  public,  and  they  should, 
therefore, be discontinued. 
Sec. 2. Revocations. (a) Executive Order 13522 of December 9, 2009 (Creating 
Labor-Management  Forums  to  Improve  Delivery  of  Government  Services), 
as  extended  by  Executive  Order  13708  of  September  30,  2015  (Continuance 
or  Reestablishment  of  Certain  Federal  Advisory  Committees),  which  estab-
lished  the  Council  and  implemented  labor-management  forums  throughout 
the executive branch, is hereby revoked. 

(b)  The  Director  of  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  and  heads  of 
executive  departments  and  agencies  shall,  consistent  with  law,  promptly 
move  to  rescind  any  orders,  rules,  regulations,  guidelines,  programs,  or 
policies implementing or enforcing Executive Order 13522. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  abrogate  any 
collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order. 

(b)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed  to  impair  or  otherwise  affect: 
(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency, 
or the head thereof; or 
(ii)  the  functions  of  the  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget 
relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(c)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations.

Notice  of  June  21,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Western  Balkans 

On  June  26,  2001,  by  Executive  Order  13219,  the  President  declared  a 
national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  Western  Balkans,  pursuant  to  the 
International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  to 
deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security 
and foreign policy of the United States constituted by the actions of persons 
engaged  in,  or  assisting,  sponsoring,  or  supporting  (i)  extremist  violence 
in the Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere in the Western Balkans region, 
or  (ii)  acts  obstructing  implementation  of  the  Dayton  Accords  in  Bosnia 
or  United  Nations  Security  Council  Resolution  1244  of  June  10,  1999,  in 
Kosovo.  The  President  subsequently  amended  that  order  in  Executive  Order 
13304 of May 28, 2003, to take additional steps with respect to acts obstruct-
ing  implementation  of  the  Ohrid  Framework  Agreement  of  2001  relating 
to Macedonia. 
The  actions  of  persons  threatening  the  peace  and  international  stabilization 
efforts  in  the  Western  Balkans,  including  acts  of  extremist  violence  and 
obstructionist activity, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this 
reason, the national emergency declared on June 26, 2001, and the measures 
adopted  on  that  date  and  thereafter  to  deal  with  that  emergency,  must 
continue  in  effect  beyond  June  26,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with 
section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am 
continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  Western 
Balkans declared in Executive Order 13219. 
This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

20795 

Proclamation  9595  of  April  28,  2017 

Asian  American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
This  month,  we  celebrate  Asian  American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage 
Month, and we recognize the achievements and contributions of Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders that enrich our Nation. 
Asian  Americans  and  Pacific  Islanders  have  distinguished  themselves  in 
the  arts,  literature,  and  sports.  They  are  leading  researchers  in  science, 
medicine, and technology; dedicated teachers to our Nation’s children; inno-
vative  farmers  and  ranchers;  and  distinguished  lawyers  and  government 
leaders. 
Dr. Sammy Lee, a Korean American who passed away last December, exem-
plified  the  spirit  of  this  month.  Dr.  Lee  was  the  first  Asian  American  man 
to  win  an  Olympic  gold  medal,  becoming  a  platform  diving  champion  at 
the 1948 London Olympics only 1 year after graduating from medical school. 
To  fulfill  his  dreams,  Dr.  Lee  overcame  several  obstacles,  including  his 
local  childhood  pool’s  policy  of  opening  to  minorities  only  once  per  week. 
Later  in  life  he  was  subject  to  housing  discrimination  (even  after  8  years 
of  military  service).  Dr.  Lee  nevertheless  tirelessly  served  his  country  and 
community,  including  by  representing  the  United  States  at  the  Olympic 
Games, on behalf of several Presidents. 
Katherine  Sui  Fun  Cheung  also  embodied  the  spirit  of  this  month.  In  1932, 
she  became  the  first  Chinese  American  woman  to  earn  a  pilot  license. 
At  the  time,  only  about  1  percent  of  pilots  in  the  United  States  were 
women. As a member of The Ninety-Nines, an organization of women pilots, 
she paved the way for thousands of women to take to the skies. 
There  are  more  than  20  million  Asian  Americans  and  Pacific  Islanders 
in  the  United  States.  Each  day,  through  their  actions,  they  make  America 
more  vibrant,  more  prosperous,  and  more  secure.  Our  Nation  is  particularly 
grateful to the many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who have served 
and  are  currently  serving  in  our  Armed  Forces,  protecting  the  Nation,  and 
promoting freedom and peace around the world. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  2017  as  Asian 
American  and  Pacific  Islander  Heritage  Month.  The  Congress,  by  Public 
Law  102–450,  as  amended,  has  also  designated  the  month  of  May  each 
year as ‘‘Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month.’’ I encourage all Americans 
to  learn  more  about  our  Asian  American,  Native  Hawaiian,  and  Pacific 
Islander  heritage,  and  to  observe  this  month  with  appropriate  programs 
and activities.

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13767  of  January  25,  2017 

Border  Security  and  Immigration  Enforcement  Improvements 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nation-
ality  Act  (8  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.)  (INA),  the  Secure  Fence  Act  of  2006 
(Public Law 109–367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform 
and  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996  (Public  Law  104–208  Div.  C) 
(IIRIRA),  and  in  order  to  ensure  the  safety  and  territorial  integrity  of  the 
United  States  as  well  as  to  ensure  that  the  Nation’s  immigration  laws  are 
faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  Border  security  is  critically  important  to  the  national 
security  of  the  United  States.  Aliens  who  illegally  enter  the  United  States 
without  inspection  or  admission  present  a  significant  threat  to  national 
security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected 
by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United 
States.  The  recent  surge  of  illegal  immigration  at  the  southern  border  with 
Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed 
agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well 
as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed. 
Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human- 
trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern 
border,  contributing  to  a  significant  increase  in  violent  crime  and  United 
States  deaths  from  dangerous  drugs.  Among  those  who  illegally  enter  are 
those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. 
Continued  illegal  immigration  presents  a  clear  and  present  danger  to  the 
interests of the United States. 
Federal  immigration  law  both  imposes  the  responsibility  and  provides  the 
means  for  the  Federal  Government,  in  cooperation  with  border  States,  to 
secure the Nation’s southern border. Although Federal immigration law pro-
vides  a  robust  framework  for  Federal-State  partnership  in  enforcing  our 
immigration laws—and the Congress has authorized and provided appropria-
tions to secure our borders—the Federal Government has failed to discharge 
this  basic  sovereign  responsibility.  The  purpose  of  this  order  is  to  direct 
executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies)  to  deploy  all  lawful  means 
to secure the Nation’s southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration 
into  the  United  States,  and  to  repatriate  illegal  aliens  swiftly,  consistently, 
and humanely. 
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to: 

(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate 
construction  of  a  physical  wall  on  the  southern  border,  monitored  and 
supported  by  adequate  personnel  so  as  to  prevent  illegal  immigration,  drug 
and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism; 

(b)  detain  individuals  apprehended  on  suspicion  of  violating  Federal  or 
State  law,  including  Federal  immigration  law,  pending  further  proceedings 
regarding those violations; 

(c)  expedite  determinations  of  apprehended  individuals’  claims  of  eligi-

bility to remain in the United States; 

(d)  remove  promptly  those  individuals  whose  legal  claims  to  remain  in 
the  United  States  have  been  lawfully  rejected,  after  any  appropriate  civil 
or criminal sanctions have been imposed; and

essary  to  achieve  complete  operational  control  of  the  southern  border,  and 
a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern

purpose  of  conducting  proceedings  authorized  under  title  8,  chapter  12, 
subchapter II, United States Code. 
Sec.  6.  Detention  for  Illegal  Entry.  The  Secretary  shall  immediately  take 
all  appropriate  actions  to  ensure  the  detention  of  aliens  apprehended  for 
violations  of  immigration  law  pending  the  outcome  of  their  removal  pro-
ceedings  or  their  removal  from  the  country  to  the  extent  permitted  by 
law.  The  Secretary  shall  issue  new  policy  guidance  to  all  Department  of 
Homeland  Security  personnel  regarding  the  appropriate  and  consistent  use 
of  lawful  detention  authority  under  the  INA,  including  the  termination  of 
the  practice  commonly  known  as  ‘‘catch  and  release,’’  whereby  aliens  are 
routinely  released  in  the  United  States  shortly  after  their  apprehension  for 
violations of immigration law. 

Sec.  7.  Return  to  Territory.  The  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate  action, 
consistent  with  the  requirements  of  section  1232  of  title  8,  United  States 
Code,  to  ensure  that  aliens  described  in  section  235(b)(2)(C)  of  the  INA 
(8  U.S.C.  1225(b)(2)(C))  are  returned  to  the  territory  from  which  they  came 
pending a formal removal proceeding. 

Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents.  Subject  to  available  appropriations, 
the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion,  shall  take  all  appropriate  action  to  hire  5,000  additional  Border  Patrol 
agents,  and  all  appropriate  action  to  ensure  that  such  agents  enter  on  duty 
and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable. 

Sec.  9.  Foreign  Aid  Reporting  Requirements.  The  head  of  each  executive 
department  and  agency  shall  identify  and  quantify  all  sources  of  direct 
and  indirect  Federal  aid  or  assistance  to  the  Government  of  Mexico  on 
an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilat-
eral  development  aid,  economic  assistance,  humanitarian  aid,  and  military 
aid.  Within  30  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  head  of  each  executive 
department  and  agency  shall  submit  this  information  to  the  Secretary  of 
State.  Within  60  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  shall  submit 
to  the  President  a  consolidated  report  reflecting  the  levels  of  such  aid 
and  assistance  that  has  been  provided  annually,  over  each  of  the  past  five 
years. 

Sec.  10.  Federal-State  Agreements.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch 
to  empower  State  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies  across  the  country 
to  perform  the  functions  of  an  immigration  officer  in  the  interior  of  the 
United States to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

(a)  In  furtherance  of  this  policy,  the  Secretary  shall  immediately  take 
appropriate  action  to  engage  with  the  Governors  of  the  States,  as  well  as 
local  officials,  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  to  enter  into  agreements  under 
section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)). 

(b)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  and  with  the  consent  of  State  or 
local  officials,  as  appropriate,  the  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate  action, 
through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to author-
ize  State  and  local  law  enforcement  officials,  as  the  Secretary  determines 
are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers 
in  relation  to  the  investigation,  apprehension,  or  detention  of  aliens  in 
the  United  States  under  the  direction  and  the  supervision  of  the  Secretary. 
Such  authorization  shall  be  in  addition  to,  rather  than  in  place  of,  Federal 
performance of these duties. 

(c)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Secretary  may  structure  each 
agreement  under  section  287(g)  of  the  INA  in  the  manner  that  provides 
the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtain-
ing operational control over the border for that jurisdiction. 
Sec.  11.  Parole,  Asylum,  and  Removal.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive 
branch  to  end  the  abuse  of  parole  and  asylum  provisions  currently  used 
to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  18 / Monday,  January  30,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

(a)  The  Secretary  shall  immediately  take  all  appropriate  action  to  ensure

gating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and cred-
ible  fear  determinations  pursuant  to  section  235(b)(1)  of  the  INA  (8  U.S.C.

only  on  a  case-by-case  basis  in  accordance  with  the  plain  language  of  the 
statute,  and  in  all  circumstances  only  when  an  individual  demonstrates 
urgent  humanitarian  reasons  or  a  significant  public  benefit  derived  from 
such parole. 

(e)  The  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate  action  to  require  that  all  Depart-
ment  of  Homeland  Security  personnel  are  properly  trained  on  the  proper

Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2)

such  actions  on  Federal  lands  as  the  Secretary  deems  necessary  and  appro-
priate to implement this order. 
Sec. 13. Priority Enforcement. The Attorney General shall take all appropriate 
steps  to  establish  prosecution  guidelines  and  allocate  appropriate  resources 
to  ensure  that  Federal  prosecutors  accord  a  high  priority  to  prosecutions 
of offenses having a nexus to the southern border. 
Sec.  14.  Government  Transparency.  The  Secretary  shall,  on  a  monthly  basis 
and in a publicly available way, report statistical data on aliens apprehended

all  Department  of  Homeland  Security  components,  in  a  format  that  is  easily 
understandable by the public.

Proclamation  9560  of  December  28,  2016 

National  Mentoring  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
With  every  generation,  our  Nation  has  expanded  the  essential  idea  that 
no matter who you are or where you come from, America is a place where— 
with  hard  work  and  perseverance—you  can  make  it  if  you  try.  Although 
obstacles and challenges along the way can be discouraging, the mentorship 
and  support  of  others  have  always  motivated  our  people  to  persevere— 
even  in  the  toughest  of  times.  At  the  start  of  each  new  year,  we  observe 
National  Mentoring  Month  to  honor  the  parents,  families,  teachers,  coaches, 
and  mentors  who  pour  their  time  and  their  love  into  lifting  up  America’s 
daughters and sons. 
Nobody  succeeds  on  their  own:  each  young  person’s  strength  and  resilience 
is  fostered  by  those  who  have  taught  them  they  can  do  anything  they 
put  their  mind  to.  Whether  helping  mentees  study  for  a  test,  learn  a  new 
skill, or lift their heads up after a setback, mentors provide them the chance 
they need to move forward and set their sights even higher. And in helping 
mentees  achieve  their  goals,  mentors  can  inspire  them  to  reach  back  and 
provide  the  same  support  to  someone  else  in  need  of  a  mentor.  To  learn 
how  you  can  mentor  others  and  make  a 
lasting  difference,  visit 
www.Serve.gov/Mentor. 
In too many communities, many children still have the odds stacked against 
them,  which  is  why  my  Administration  has  striven  to  increase  mentorship 
opportunities  across  our  country.  Among  other  steps  we  have  taken,  we 
established  the  My  Brother’s  Keeper  initiative,  which  has  inspired  private 
organizations  and  communities  in  every  State  to  address  opportunity  gaps 
and  encourage  mentorship  as  a  tool  for  helping  all  young  people  reach 
their full potential. At the White House, we started our own mentee program 
and  regularly  met  with  local  youth  to  provide  leadership  and  guidance. 
And  our  efforts  to  bring  higher  education  within  reach  for  more  Americans 
and  expand  apprenticeship  initiatives  have  helped  ensure  more  students 
can  access  the  educational  and  career  opportunities  they  need  to  thrive. 
This  month,  we  reflect  on  the  transformative  role  mentorship  can  play 
and acknowledge the many ways that mentors have helped our next genera-
tion  of  leaders  and  innovators  grow.  As  a  Nation,  we  are  stronger  when 
every  individual  has  the  opportunity  to  contribute  to  our  American  story. 
By  working  to  give  each  person  a  better  chance  at  success,  we  can  unlock 
their potential and empower them to serve others in the same way. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  2017  as 
National Mentoring Month. I call upon public officials, business and commu-
nity  leaders,  educators,  and  Americans  across  the  country  to  observe  this 
month with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9564  of  January  12,  2017 

Boundary  Enlargement  of 
Monument 

the  Cascade-Siskiyou  National 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Through Proclamation 7318 of June 9, 2000, President Bill Clinton established 
the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument (monument) to protect the ecologi-
cal wonders and biological diversity at the interface of the Cascade, Klamath, 
and  Siskiyou  ecoregions.  The  area,  home  to  an  incredible  variety  of  species 
and  habitats,  represents  a  rich  mosaic  of  forests,  grasslands,  shrublands, 
and  wet  meadows.  The  many  rare  and  endemic  plant  and  animal  species 
found  here  are  a  testament  to  Cascade-Siskiyou’s  unique  ecosystems  and 
biotic communities. 
As  President  Clinton  noted  in  Proclamation  7318,  the  ecological  integrity 
of  the  ecosystems  that  harbor  this  diverse  array  of  species  is  vital  to  their 
continued existence. Since 2000, scientific studies of the area have reinforced 
that  the  environmental  processes  supporting  the  biodiversity  of  the  monu-
ment  require  habitat  connectivity  corridors  for  species  migration  and  dis-
persal.  Additionally,  they  require  a  range  of  habitats  that  can  be  resistant 
and  resilient  to  large-scale  disturbance  such  as  fire,  insects  and  disease, 
invasive  species,  drought,  or  floods,  events  likely  to  be  exacerbated  by 
climate  change.  Expanding  the  monument  to  include  Horseshoe  Ranch,  the 
Jenny  Creek  watershed,  the  Grizzly  Peak  area,  Lost  Lake,  the  Rogue  Valley 
foothills,  the  Southern  Cascades  area,  and  the  area  surrounding  Surveyor 
Mountain will create a Cascade-Siskiyou landscape that provides vital habitat 
connectivity,  watershed  protection,  and  landscape-scale  resilience  for  the 
area’s  critically  important  natural  resources.  Such  an  expansion  will  bolster 
protection  of  the  resources  within  the  original  boundaries  of  the  monument 
and  will  also  protect  the  important  biological  and  historic  resources  within 
the expansion area. 
The  ancient  Siskiyou  and  Klamath  Mountains  meet  the  volcanic  Cascade 
Mountains near the border of California and Oregon, creating an intersection 
of three ecoregions in Jackson and Klamath Counties in Oregon and Siskiyou 
County  in  California.  Towering  rock  peaks  covered  in  alpine  forests  rise 
above mixed woodlands, open glades, dense chaparral, meadows filled with 
stunning wildflowers, and swiftly-flowing streams. 
Native American occupancy of this remarkably diverse landscape dates back 
thousands  of  years,  and  Euro-American  settlers  also  passed  through  the 
expansion  area.  The  Applegate  Trail,  a  branch  of  the  California  National 
Historic Trail, passes through both the existing monument and the expansion 
area  following  old  routes  used  by  trappers  and  miners,  who  themselves 
made  use  of  trails  developed  by  Native  Americans.  Today,  visitors  to  the 
Applegate  Trail  can  walk  paths  worn  by  wagon  trains  of  settlers  seeking 
a  new  life  in  the  west.  The  trail,  a  less  hazardous  alternative  to  the  Oregon 
Trail,  began  to  see  regular  wagon  traffic  in  1846  and  helped  thousands 
of settlers traverse the area more safely on their way north to the Willamette 
Valley  or  south  to  California  in  search  of  gold—one  of  the  largest  mass 
migrations  in  American  history.  Soon  thereafter,  early  ranchers,  loggers, 
and homesteaders began to occupy the area, leaving traces of their presence,

which  provide  potential  for  future  research  into  the  era  of  westward  expan-
sion in southwestern Oregon. A historic ranch can be seen in the Horseshoe 
Ranch Wildlife Area, in the northernmost reaches of California. 

The  Cascade-Siskiyou  landscape  is  formed  by  the  convergence  of  the  Klam-
ath, the Siskiyou, and the Cascade mountain ranges. The Siskiyou Mountains, 
which  contain  Oregon’s  oldest  rocks  dating  to  425  million  years,  have  an 
east-west  orientation  that  connects  the  newer  Cascade  Mountains  with  the 
ancient  Klamath  Mountains.  The  tectonic  action  that  formed  the  Klamath 
and  Siskiyou  Mountains  occurred  over  130  million  years  ago,  while  the 
Cascades were formed by more recent volcanism. The Rogue Valley foothills 
contain  Eocene  and  Miocene  formations  of  black  andesite  lava  along  with 
younger High Cascade olivine basalt. In the Grizzly Peak area, the 25 million- 
year geologic history includes basaltic lava flows known as the Roxy Forma-
tion,  along  with  the  formation  of  a  large  strato-volcano,  Mount  Grizzly. 
Old Baldy, another extinct volcanic cone, rises above the surrounding forest 
in the far northeast of the expansion area. 

Cascade-Siskiyou’s  biodiversity,  which  provides  habitat  for  a  dazzling  array 
of  species,  is  internationally  recognized  and  has  been  studied  extensively 
by  ecologists,  evolutionary  biologists,  botanists,  entomologists,  and  wildlife 
biologists.  Ranging  from  high  slopes  of  Shasta  red  fir  to  lower  elevations 
with  Douglas  fir,  ponderosa  pine,  incense  cedar,  and  oak  savannas,  the 
topography  and  elevation  gradient  of  the  area  has  helped  create  stunningly 
diverse  ecosystems.  From  ancient  and  mixed-aged  conifer  and  hardwood 
forests  to  chaparral,  oak  woodlands,  wet  meadows,  shrublands,  fens,  and 
open  native  perennial  grasslands,  the  landscape  harbors  extraordinarily  var-
ied and diverse plant communities. Among these are threatened and endan-
gered plant species and habitat for numerous other rare and endemic species. 

Grizzly  Peak  and  the  surrounding  Rogue  Valley  foothills  in  the  northwest 
part  of  the  expansion  area  are  home  to  rare  populations  of  plant  species 
such  as  rock  buckwheat,  Baker’s  globemallow,  and  tall  bugbane.  More  than 
275  species  of  flowering  plants,  including  Siberian  spring  beauty,  bluehead 
gilia,  Detling’s  silverpuffs,  bushy  blazingstar,  southern  Oregon  buttercup, 
Oregon  geranium,  mountain  lady  slipper,  Egg  Lake  monkeyflower,  green- 
flowered  ginger,  and  Coronis  fritillary  can  be  found  here.  Ferns  such  as 
the  fragile  fern,  lace  fern,  and  western  sword  fern  contribute  to  the  lush 
green landscape. 

Ancient  sugar  pine  and  ponderosa  pine  thrive  in  the  Lost  Lake  Research 
Natural Area in the north, along with white fir and Douglas fir, with patches 
of  Oregon  white  oak  and  California  black  oak.  Occasional  giant  chinquapin, 
Pacific  yew,  and  bigleaf  maple  contribute  to  the  diversity  of  tree  species 
here.  Shrubs  such  as  western  serviceberry,  oceanspray,  Cascade  barberry, 
and  birchleaf  mountain  mahogany  grow  throughout  the  area,  along  with 
herbaceous 
including  pale  bellflower,  broadleaf  starflower, 
pipsissewa, and Alaska oniongrass. Creamy stonecrop, a flowering succulent, 
thrives on rocky hillsides. Patches of abundant ferns include coffee cliffbrake 
and  arrowleaf  sword  fern.  Moon  Prairie  contains  a  late  successional  stand 
of  Douglas  fir  and  white  fir  with  Pacific  yew,  ponderosa  pine,  and  sugar 
pine. 

species 

Old  Baldy’s  high-elevation  forests  in  the  northeast  include  Shasta  red  fir, 
mountain  hemlock,  Pacific  silver  fir,  and  western  white  pine  along  with 
Southern Oregon Cascades chaparral. Nearby, Tunnel Creek is a high-altitude 
lodgepole  pine  swamp  with  bog  blueberry  and  numerous  sensitive  sedge 
species  such  as  capitate  sedge, 
lesser  bladderwort,  slender  sedge, 
tomentypnum moss, and Newberry’s gentian. 

The  eastern  portion  of  the  expansion,  in  the  area  surrounding  Surveyor 
Mountain, is home to high desert species such as bitterbrush and sagebrush, 
along  with  late  successional  dry  coniferous  forests  containing  lodgepole 
pine, dry currant, and western white pine.

The  Horseshoe  Ranch  Wildlife  Area  in  Siskiyou  County,  California,  offers 
particularly  significant  ecological  connectivity  and  integrity.  The  area  con-
tains  a  broad  meadow  ecosystem  punctuated  by  Oregon  white  oak  and 
western  juniper  woodlands  alongside  high  desert  species  such  as  gray 
rabbitbrush  and  antelope  bitterbrush.  The  area  is  also  home  to  the  scarlet 
fritillary,  Greene’s  mariposa  lily,  Bellinger’s  meadowfoam,  and  California’s 
only population of the endangered Gentner’s fritillary. 
The incredible biodiversity of plant communities in the expansion is mirrored 
by  equally  stunning  animal  diversity,  supported  by  the  wide  variety  of 
intact  habitats  and  undisturbed  corridors  allowing  animal  migration  and 
movement. Perhaps most notably, the Cascade-Siskiyou landscape, including 
the  Upper  Jenny  Creek  Watershed  and  the  Southern  Cascades,  provides 
vitally  important  habitat  connectivity  for  the  threatened  northern  spotted 
owl.  Other  raptors,  including  the  bald  eagle,  golden  eagle,  white-tailed  kite, 
peregrine falcon, merlin, great gray owl, sharp-shinned hawk, Cooper’s hawk, 
osprey,  American  kestrel,  northern  goshawk,  flammulated  owl,  and  prairie 
falcon,  soar  above  the  meadows,  mountains,  and  forests  as  they  seek  their 
prey. 
Ornithologists  and  birdwatchers  alike  come  to  the  Cascade-Siskiyou  land-
scape  for  the  variety  of  birds  found  here.  Tricolored  blackbird,  grasshopper 
sparrow,  bufflehead,  black  swift,  Lewis’s  woodpecker,  purple  martin,  blue 
grouse, common nighthawk, dusky flycatcher, lazuli bunting, mountain quail, 
olive-sided  flycatcher,  Pacific-slope  flycatcher,  pileated  woodpecker,  ruffed 
grouse,  rufous  hummingbird,  varied  thrush,  Vaux’s  swift,  western  meadow-
lark,  western  tanager,  white-headed  woodpecker,  and  Wilson’s  warbler  are 
among  the  many  species  of  terrestrial  birds  that  make  their  homes  in  the 
expansion  area.  The  Oregon  vesper  sparrow,  among  the  most  imperiled 
bird  species  in  the  region,  has  been  documented  in  the  meadows  of  the 
upper Jenny Creek Watershed. 
Shore  and  marsh  birds,  including  the  Tule  goose,  yellow  rail,  snowy  egret, 
harlequin  duck,  Franklin’s  gull,  red-necked  grebe,  sandhill  crane,  pintail, 
common goldeneye, bufflehead, greater yellowlegs, and least sandpiper, also 
inhabit the expansion area’s lakes, ponds, and streams. 
Diverse  species  of  mammals,  including  the  black-tailed  deer,  elk,  pygmy 
rabbit, American pika, and northern flying squirrel, depend upon the extraor-
dinary  ecosystems  found  in  the  area.  Beavers  and  river  otters  inhabit  the 
landscape’s  streams  and  rivers,  while  Horseshoe  Ranch  Wildlife  Area  has 
been  identified  as  a  critical  big  game  winter  range.  Bat  species  including 
the  pallid  bat,  Townsend’s  big-eared  bat,  and  fringed  myotis  hunt  insects 
beginning at dusk. The expansion area encompasses known habitat for endan-
gered  gray  wolves,  including  a  portion  of  the  area  of  known  activity  for 
the  Keno  wolves.  Other  carnivores  such  as  the  Pacific  fisher,  cougar,  Amer-
ican  badger,  black  bear,  coyote,  and  American  marten  can  be  seen  and 
studied in the expansion area. 
The landscape also contains many hydrologic features that capture the inter-
est  of  visitors.  Rivers  and  streams  cascade  through  the  mountains,  and 
waterfalls  such  as  Jenny  Creek  Falls  provide  aquatic  habitat  along  with 
scenic  beauty.  The  upper  headwaters  of  the  Jenny  Creek  watershed  are 
vital  to  the  ecological  integrity  of  the  watershed  as  a  whole,  creating  clear 
cold  water  that  provides  essential  habitat  for  fish  living  at  the  margin  of 
their  environmental  tolerances.  Fens  and  wetlands,  along  with  riparian  wet-
lands  and  wet  montane  meadows,  can  be  found  in  the  eastern  portion 
of the expansion area. Lost Lake, in the northernmost portion of the expansion 
area,  contains  a  large  lake  that  serves  as  Western  pond  turtle  habitat,  along 
with another upstream waterfall. 
The  expansion  area  includes  habitat  for  populations  of  the  endemic  Jenny 
Creek  sucker  and  Jenny  Creek  redband  trout,  as  well  as  habitat  for  the 
Klamath largescale sucker, the endangered shortnose sucker, and the endan-
gered  Lost  River  sucker.  The  watershed  also  contains  potential  habitat  for

the  threatened  coho  salmon.  Numerous  species  of  aquatic  plants  grow  in 
the area’s streams, lakes, and ponds. 
Amphibians  such  as  black  salamander,  Pacific  giant  salamander,  foothill 
yellow-legged  frog,  Cascade  frog,  the  threatened  Oregon  spotted  frog,  and 
the  endemic  Siskiyou  Mountains  salamander  thrive  here  thanks  to  the 
connectivity  between  terrestrial  and  aquatic  habitats.  Reptiles  found  in  the 
expansion  area  include  the  western  pond  turtle,  northern  alligator  lizard, 
desert striped whipsnake, and northern Pacific rattlesnake. 
The  Cascade-Siskiyou  landscape’s  remarkable  biodiversity  includes  the  as-
tounding  diversity  of  invertebrates  found  in  the  expansion,  including  fresh-
water  mollusks  like  the  Oregon  shoulderband,  travelling  sideband,  modoc 
rim  sideband,  Klamath  taildropper,  chase  sideband,  Fall  Creek  pebblesnail, 
Keene  Creek  pebblesnail,  and  Siskiyou  hesperian.  The  area  has  been  identi-
fied  by  evolutionary  biologists  as  a  center  of  endemism  and  diversity  for 
springsnails,  and  researchers  have  discovered 
four  new  species  of 
mygalomorph  spiders  in  the  expansion.  Pollinators  such  as  Franklin’s  bum-
blebee,  western  bumblebee,  and  butterflies  including  Johnson’s  hairstreak, 
gray blue butterfly, mardon skipper, and Oregon branded skipper are critical 
to  the  ecosystems’  success.  Other  insects  found  here  include  the  Siskiyou 
short-horned grasshopper and numerous species of caddisfly. 
The  Cascade-Siskiyou  landscape  has  long  been  a  focus  for  scientific  studies 
of  ecology,  evolutionary  biology,  wildlife  biology,  entomology,  and  botany. 
The  expansion  area  provides  an  invaluable  resource  to  scientists  and  con-
servationists  wishing  to  research  and  sustain  the  functioning  of  the  land-
scape’s ecosystems into the future. 
The expansion area includes numerous objects of scientific or historic inter-
est. This enlargement of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument will main-
tain  its  diverse  array  of  natural  and  scientific  resources  and  preserve  its 
cultural  and  historic  legacy,  ensuring  that  the  scientific  and  historic  values 
of this area remain for the benefit of all Americans. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  in  all  cases  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible 
with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  the  objects  of  scientific 
and historic interest on these public lands as an enlargement of the boundary 
of the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  part  of  the  Cascade  Siskiyou  National  Monument 
and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  part  thereof

Proclamation  9607  of  May  5,  2017 

Public  Service  Recognition  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  Public  Service  Recognition  Week,  we  express  gratitude  for  our  civil 
servants.  Their  daily  effort  keeps  our  Government  functioning  and  helps 
make our Nation exceptional. 

Throughout my first 100 days, I have seen the tremendous work civil servants 
do  to  fulfill  our  duty  to  the  American  people.  At  all  levels  of  government, 
our  public  servants  put  our  country  and  our  people  first.  The  hard  work 
of  our  mail  carriers,  teachers,  firefighters,  transit  workers,  and  many  more, 
creates  an  environment  that  allows  individuals  and  companies  to  thrive. 
To  empower  our  civil  servants  to  best  help  others,  the  Government  must 
always  operate  more  efficiently  and  more  securely.  In  March,  I  issued  an 
Executive  Order  on  a  Comprehensive  Plan  for  Reorganizing  the  Executive 
Branch.  I  am  counting  on  our  civil  servants  to  seize  upon  that  order  and 
make our Government dramatically more accountable, effective, and efficient, 
by  going  beyond  the  modernization  efforts  of  the  past  and  re-examining 
the  operational  core  of  our  executive  departments  and  agencies.  Together, 
through  these  and  other  efforts,  we  will  fulfill  our  responsibilities  to  make 
our Government work better for the American people. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  7  through 
May  13,  2017,  as  Public  Service  Recognition  Week.  I  call  upon  Americans 
and  all  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  government  agencies  to  recognize 
the  dedication  of  our  Nation’s  public  servants  and  to  observe  this  week 
through appropriate programs and activities.

Proclamation  9603  of  May  1,  2017 

National  Mental  Health  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
National Mental Health Awareness Month is a time to recognize the millions 
of  American  families  affected  by  mental  illness  and  to  redouble  our  efforts 
to  ensure  that  those  who  are  suffering  get  the  care  and  treatment  they 
need.  Nearly  10  million  Americans  suffer  from  a  serious  mental  illness, 
such  as  schizophrenia,  bipolar  disorder,  or  major  depression.  Unfortunately, 
approximately  60  percent  of  adults  and  50  percent  of  adolescents  with 
mental  illness  do  not  get  the  treatment  or  other  services  they  need.  As 
a  result,  instead  of  receiving  ongoing  expert  psychiatric  care,  these  individ-
uals  often  find  themselves  in  emergency  rooms,  prisons,  or  living  on  the 
streets. 
This  month,  and  for  the  course  of  my  Administration,  I  am  committed 
to  working  with  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services,  States, 
and  communities  throughout  the  country  to  find  a  better  answer  for  the 
millions  of  Americans  who  need  mental  health  services  and  their  families. 
We must further empower States, law enforcement, first responders, doctors, 
and  families  to  help  those  with  the  most  severe  mental  illnesses;  to  ensure 
that  people  with  mental  illness  have  access  to  evidence-based  treatment 
and  services;  and  to  fight  the  stigma  associated  with  mental  illness,  which 
can  prevent  people  from  seeking  care.  We  must  also  resolve  to  enhance 
our  understanding  of  mental  illness  and  its  relationship  to  other  complex 
societal  challenges,  including  homelessness,  substance  abuse,  and  suicide; 
and  we  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  improving  prevention,  diagnosis,  and 
treatment through innovative medical strategies. 
Addressing  substance  abuse,  addiction,  and  overdose  is  often  critical  to 
improving mental health outcomes. An estimated 8.1 million adults in Amer-
ica suffering with a mental illness also struggle with substance abuse. Many 
of  those  who  struggled  with  both  were  among  the  52,000  people  in  our 
country  who  died  from  a  drug  overdose  in  2015.  Approximately  44,000 
Americans  took  their  own  lives  in  the  past  year,  a  preventable  tragedy 
that frequently correlates with mental illness and substance abuse. 
On May 4, 2017, my Administration, along with more than 160 organizations 
and  1,100  communities,  will  commemorate  National  Children’s  Mental 
Health  Awareness  Day.  At  this  national  event,  Health  and  Human  Services 
Secretary  Tom  Price  will  give  special  recognition  awards  to  Awareness  Day 
Honorary  Chairpersons  and  United  States  Olympic  champions  Michael 
Phelps and Allison Schmitt for speaking openly about their behavioral health 
challenges  and  for  encouraging  young  Americans  to  lead  healthy  lives.  The 
event will help promote the importance of National Mental Health Awareness 
Month, providing Americans with resources related to treatment and services 
for mental health and substance abuse. 
No  American  should  suffer  in  silence  and  solitude.  During  Mental  Health 
Awareness  Month,  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  seek  to  better  understand 
mental  illness  and  to  look  for  opportunities  to  help  those  with  mental 
health  issues.  We  must  support  those  in  need  and  remain  committed  to 
hope and healing. Through compassion and committed action, we will enrich 
the spirit of the American people and improve the well-being of our Nation.

Designating  the  World  Organisation  for  Animal  Health  as  a 
Public  International  Organization  Entitled  To  Enjoy  Certain

Section  1.  Designation.  By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the

Presidential  Determination  No.  2017–12  of  September  13,  2017 

Presidential  Determination  on  Major  Drug  Transit  or  Major 
Illicit  Drug  Producing  Countries  for  Fiscal  Year  2018 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State 

Pursuant to section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal 
Year  2003  (Public  Law  107–228)  (FRAA),  I  hereby  identify  the  following 
countries as major drug transit and/or major illicit drug producing countries: 
Afghanistan,  The  Bahamas,  Belize,  Bolivia,  Burma,  Colombia,  Costa  Rica, 
Dominican  Republic,  Ecuador,  El  Salvador,  Guatemala,  Haiti,  Honduras, 
India,  Jamaica,  Laos,  Mexico,  Nicaragua,  Pakistan,  Panama,  Peru,  and  Ven-
ezuela. 
A  country’s  presence  on  the  foregoing  list  is  not  necessarily  a  reflection 
of  its  government’s  counternarcotics  efforts  or  level  of  cooperation  with 
the  United  States.  Consistent  with  the  statutory  definition  of  a  major  drug 
transit  or  drug  producing  country  set  forth  in  section  481(e)(2)  and  (5) 
of  the  Foreign  Assistance  Act  of  1961,  as  amended  (FAA),  the  reason  major 
drug  transit  or  illicit  drug  producing  countries  are  placed  on  the  list  is 
the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow 
drugs  to  transit  or  be  produced,  even  if  a  government  has  carried  out 
the most assiduous narcotics control law enforcement measures. 
Pursuant  to  section  706(2)(A)  of  the  FRAA,  I  hereby  designate  Bolivia  and 
Venezuela  as  countries  that  have  failed  demonstrably  during  the  previous 
12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics 
agreements,  and  to  take  the  measures  required  by  section  489(a)(1)  of  the 
FAA. Included with this determination are justifications for the designations 
of  Bolivia  and  Venezuela,  as  required  by  section  706(2)(B)  of  the  FRAA. 
In  addition,  the  United  States  Government  seriously  considered  designating 
Colombia as a country that has failed demonstrably to adhere to its obligations 
under  international  counternarcotics  agreements  due  to  the  extraordinary 
growth  of  coca  cultivation  and  cocaine  production  over  the  past  3  years, 
including record cultivation during the last 12 months. Ultimately, Colombia 
is  not  designated  because  the  Colombian  National  Police  and  Armed  Forces 
are  close  law  enforcement  and  security  partners  of  the  United  States  in 
the  Western  Hemisphere,  they  are  improving  interdiction  efforts,  and  have 
restarted  some  eradication  that  they  had  significantly  curtailed  beginning 
in  2013.  I  will,  however,  keep  this  designation  under  section  706(2)(A) 
of the FRAA as an option, and expect Colombia to make significant progress 
in reducing coca cultivation and production of cocaine. 
I  have  also  determined,  in  accordance  with  provisions  of  section  706(3)(A) 
of  the  FRAA,  that  support  for  programs  to  aid  the  people  of  Venezuela 
are vital to the national interests of the United States.

Memorandum  of  January  23,  2017 

Withdrawal  of  the  United  States  From  the  Trans-Pacific  Part-
nership  Negotiations  and  Agreement 

Memorandum  for  the  United  States  Trade  Representative 

It  is  the  policy  of  my  Administration  to  represent  the  American  people 
and  their  financial  well-being  in  all  negotiations,  particularly  the  American 
worker, and to create fair and economically beneficial trade deals that serve 
their  interests.  Additionally,  in  order  to  ensure  these  outcomes,  it  is  the 
intention  of  my  Administration  to  deal  directly  with  individual  countries 
on  a  one-on-one  (or  bilateral)  basis  in  negotiating  future  trade  deals.  Trade 
with  other  nations  is,  and  always  will  be,  of  paramount  importance  to 
my Administration and to me, as President of the United States. 
Based  on  these  principles,  and  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President 
by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby 
direct  you  to  withdraw  the  United  States  as  a  signatory  to  the  Trans-Pacific 
Partnership  (TPP),  to  permanently  withdraw  the  United  States  from  TPP 
negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotia-
tions  to  promote  American  industry,  protect  American  workers,  and  raise 
American wages. 
You  are  directed  to  provide  written  notification  to  the  Parties  and  to  the 
Depository  of  the  TPP,  as  appropriate,  that  the  United  States  withdraws 
as  a  signatory  of  the  TPP  and  withdraws  from  the  TPP  negotiating  process. 
You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal 
Register.

Proclamation  9582  of  March  31,  2017 

National  Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Childhood  is  precious.  Growing  up  in  a  loving  home,  with  a  nurturing 
family,  surrounded  by  a  safe  community  gives  our  children  the  best  oppor-
tunity  to  realize  their  full  potential.  Sadly,  mistreatment  by  parents,  guard-
ians,  relatives,  or  caregivers  all  too  often  threatens  children’s  ability  to 
flourish.  Abuse  or  neglect  can  rob  children  of  their  sense  of  dignity  and 
worth,  which  are  indispensable  to  the  pursuit  of  happiness  and  success 
in the classroom, in the workplace, and in relationships. Children rightfully 
impose  a  moral  obligation  on  adults,  who  must  protect  them  from  harm 
and  preserve  their  opportunity  to  reach  their  full  potential  and  achieve 
their  dreams.  They  deserve  nothing  less.  The  dreams  of  our  children  are 
the future of this country. 
As  we  observe  National  Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month,  we  renew  our 
commitment  to  stop  child  abuse  before  it  begins.  That  means  preventing 
destructive  conduct  from  shattering  the  secure  and  protective  environments 
in  which  our  children  deserve  to  live,  learn,  and  thrive.  We  must  all  be 
aware  of  the  signs  of  child  maltreatment  and  take  appropriate  steps  to 
safeguard  children  by  reporting  concerns  and  connecting  families  with  the 
help they may need. 
The family is society’s most important institution, and its impact on human 
potential  is  unmatched  by  any  other  influence  that  government,  education, 
or even community can wield. We must promote strong families. By respect-
ing  and  supporting  parents,  we  will  reduce  risks  and  increase  the  safety 
and  protection  critical  to  our  children’s  happiness  and  success.  The  best 
child  abuse  prevention  program  is  a  strong  family  with  well-equipped,  ma-
ture, and child-focused parents. We therefore celebrate the many community 
members who help parents fulfill their moral obligations by providing them 
a needed shoulder to lean on in troubled times. 
We  also  honor  foster  and  adoptive  parents,  child  protective  workers,  faith 
leaders, community mentors, teachers, and law enforcement officials, whose 
tireless  work  every  day  protects  children  who  have  been  tragically  abused 
or  neglected.  Their  often  thankless  service  in  these  difficult  and  painful 
situations  helps  restore  the  safety  and  dignity  of  these  wounded  children 
and,  in  many  cases,  dramatically  improves  the  course  of  their  precious 
lives.  As  a  Nation,  we  pledge  to  honor  our  commitment  to  protecting  the 
vulnerable among us, not just this month, but every day of the year. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National 
Child  Abuse  Prevention  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  be  alert  to 
the  safety  and  well-being  of  children  and  to  support  efforts  that  promote 
their physical, emotional, and developmental health.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9637  of  September  13,  2017 

National  Hispanic  Heritage  Month,  2017 

43661 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During National Hispanic Heritage Month, we celebrate the accomplishments 
of  Hispanic  Americans  who  have  helped  shape  our  great  Nation.  We  are 
grateful  for  the  many  contributions  Hispanic  American  men  and  women 
make to our society and the vibrancy they weave into our American culture. 
From  America’s  earliest  days,  Hispanic  Americans  have  played  a  prominent 
and important role in our national heritage, and Hispanic Americans continue 
to embody the pioneering spirit of America today. Demonstrating a steadfast 
commitment  to  faith,  family,  and  hard  work,  Hispanic  Americans  lift  up 
our  communities  and  our  economy  as  entrepreneurs,  executives,  and  small 
business  owners,  and  make  contributions  in  areas  such  as  science,  art, 
music,  politics,  academia,  government,  and  sports.  In  fact,  Hispanic-owned 
small  businesses  are  the  fastest  growing  businesses  in  America,  starting 
at  a  pace  15  times  the  national  average  over  the  last  decade.  Hispanic 
Americans  own  more  than  three  million  American  businesses  and  serve 
with  honor  in  all  branches  of  the  Armed  Forces,  continuing  a  strong  legacy 
of  dedication  to  our  country  that  has  seen  the  Medal  of  Honor  awarded 
to 60 Hispanic Americans. Hispanic Americans are a testament to the Amer-
ican  promise  that  anyone  can  succeed  in  the  United  States  through  hard 
work. 
Hispanic  Americans  strengthen  our  bonds  with  our  Latin  American  neigh-
bors,  with  whom  we  share  a  rich  history.  We  are  united  with  them  in 
hemispheric  solidarity,  based  on  a  shared  commitment  to  democratic  prin-
ciples.  To  secure  a  more  prosperous,  free  Western  Hemisphere,  we  are 
working  to  advance  and  maintain  democracy  in  the  region  and  secure  free 
and  fair  trade  among  our  regional  partners.  My  Administration  is  dedicated 
to  securing  human  rights  in  Cuba  and  Venezuela,  and  strengthening  our 
cultural and philosophical ties with all our Latin American partners. 
This month, we recognize the countless contributions of Hispanic Americans 
that  help  make  our  Nation  a  thriving  and  secure  land  of  opportunity.  To 
honor  the  achievements  of  Hispanic  Americans,  the  Congress  by  Public 
Law  100–402,  as  amended,  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to 
issue  annually  a  proclamation  designating  September  15  through  October 
15 as ‘‘National Hispanic Heritage Month.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 15 through 
October  15,  2017,  as  National  Hispanic  Heritage  Month.  I  call  upon  public 
officials,  educators,  librarians,  and  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month 
with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9620  of  May  31,  2017 

National  Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
National  Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month  is  a  celebration  of  the  accom-
plishments  of  Caribbean  Americans  and  our  long,  shared  history  with  the 
peoples of the Caribbean. We are grateful for the culture Caribbean Americans 
have  shared  with  our  Nation  and  the  many  contributions  they  have  made 
to our society. 
Throughout our history, Caribbean Americans have helped create and main-
tain  the  strength  and  independence  of  our  Nation.  Alexander  Hamilton, 
who  came  from  poverty  in  Nevis,  was  a  key  contributor  to  our  Constitution 
and  the  first  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  helping  to  establish  our  modern 
financial system and to create the United States Coast Guard. 
Every  day,  Caribbean  Americans  help  make  America  more  prosperous  and 
secure. Our Nation is particularly grateful to the many Caribbean Americans 
who  have  served  and  are  currently  serving  in  our  Armed  Forces,  protecting 
our  Nation,  and  promoting  freedom  and  peace  around  the  world.  Today, 
more  than  four  million  Caribbean  Americans  live  in  the  United  States  and 
continue to contribute to a vibrant culture that enriches our Nation. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National 
Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  join  in 
celebrating  the  history,  culture,  and  achievements  of  Caribbean  Americans 
with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9576  of  March  1,  2017 

Women’s  History  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
We  are  proud  of  our  Nation’s  achievements  in  promoting  women’s  full 
participation in all aspects of American life and are resolute in our commit-
ment to supporting women’s continued advancement in America and around 
the world. 
America  honors  the  celebrated  women  pioneers  and  leaders  in  our  history, 
as  well  as  those  unsung  women  heroes  of  our  daily  lives.  We  honor  those 
outstanding women, whose contributions to our Nation’s life, culture, history, 
economy,  and  families  have  shaped  us  and  helped  us  fulfill  America’s 
promise. 
We  cherish  the  incredible  accomplishments  of  early  American  women,  who 
helped  found  our  Nation  and  explore  the  great  western  frontier.  Women 
have  been  steadfast  throughout  our  battles  to  end  slavery,  as  well  as  our 
battles  abroad.  And  American  women  fought  for  the  civil  rights  of  women 
and  others  in  the  suffrage  and  civil  rights  movements.  Millions  of  bold, 
fearless  women  have  succeeded  as  entrepreneurs  and  in  the  workplace, 
all  the  while  remaining  the  backbone  of  our  families,  our  communities, 
and our country. 
During  Women’s  History  Month,  we  pause  to  pay  tribute  to  the  remarkable 
women  who  prevailed  over  enormous  barriers,  paving  the  way  for  women 
of  today  to  not  only  participate  in  but  to  lead  and  shape  every  facet  of 
American  life.  Since  our  beginning,  we  have  been  blessed  with  courageous 
women  like  Henrietta  Johnson,  the  first  woman  known  to  work  as  an  artist 
in the colonies; Margaret Corbin, who bravely fought in the American Revolu-
tion; and Abigail Adams, First Lady of the United States and trusted advisor 
to President John Adams. 
We  also  remember  incredible  women  like  Mary  Walker,  the  first  woman 
to  receive  the  Congressional  Medal  of  Honor;  Harriet  Tubman,  who  escaped 
slavery  in  1849  and  went  on  to  free  hundreds  of  others  through  the  Under-
ground Railroad; Susan B. Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolu-
tion  and  her  friend,  Dr.  Charlotte  Lozier,  one  of  the  first  women  medical 
doctors  in  the  United  States,  both  of  whom  advocated  for  the  dignity  and 
equality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; Rosa Parks, whose 
refusal  to  give  up  her  seat  accelerated  the  modern  civil  rights  movement; 
Shirley  Temple  Black,  the  famous  actress  turned  diplomat  and  first  chief 
of  protocol  for  the  President  of  the  United  States;  Anna  Bissell,  the  first 
woman  CEO  in  American  history;  Amelia  Earhart,  the  first  woman  to  fly 
solo  across  the  Atlantic  Ocean;  Ella  Fitzgerald,  the  First  Lady  of  Song  and 
the  Queen  of  Jazz;  and  Sally  Ride,  the  first  American  woman  astronaut. 
America  will  continue  to  fight  for  women’s  rights  and  equality  across  the 
country  and  around  the  world.  Though  poverty  holds  back  many  women, 
America  cannot  and  will  not  allow  this  to  persist.  We  will  empower  all 
women  to  pursue  their  American  dreams,  to  live,  work  and  thrive  in  safe 
communities  that  allow  them  to  protect  and  provide  for  themselves  and 
their families.

America  is  also  mindful  of  the  fight  that  continues  for  so  many  women 
around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgrace-
fully  as  second-class  citizens.  America  will  fight  for  these  women  too,  and 
it  will  fight  to  protect  young  girls  who  are  robbed  of  their  rights,  trafficked 
around the world, and exploited. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

Proclamation  9616  of  May  19,  2017 

National  Maritime  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  National  Maritime  Day,  we  recognize  the  important  role  the  United 
States  Merchant  Marine  plays  in  supporting  our  commerce  and  national 
security.  We  honor  the  proud  history  of  our  merchant  mariners  and  their 
important contributions in strengthening our economy. 
Americans  have  long  looked  to  the  sea  as  a  source  of  safety  and  well- 
being.  Bounded  by  two  oceans  and  the  Gulf  of  Mexico,  and  crisscrossed 
by  inland  waterways,  America  was  destined  to  be  a  maritime  nation.  Our 
fledgling  Republic  expanded  and  became  stronger,  as  our  Nation’s  growing 
Merchant  Marine  connected  the  States  and  cemented  ties  among  our  new 
allies. 
Today, the men and women who crew ships remain essential to our Nation’s 
prosperity and security. Those in the maritime industry, including merchant 
mariners,  promote  our  economic  growth,  facilitating  the  export  of  more 
than  $475  billion  in  goods  just  last  year  and  sustaining  our  critical  defense 
industrial base. Merchant mariners also actively protect our homeland, serv-
ing  as  our  eyes  and  ears  on  the  seas.  They  serve  with  distinction  and 
courage,  heading  into  war  zones,  and  too  often  sacrificing  their  own  lives 
for our protection. 
The  Congress,  by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  20,  1933,  has  designated 
May  22  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National  Maritime  Day,’’  to  commemorate  the 
first  transoceanic  voyage  by  a  steamship,  in  1819  by  the  S.S.  Savannah. 
By  this  resolution,  the  Congress  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President 
to  issue  annually  a  proclamation  calling  for  its  appropriate  observance. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Donald  J.  Trump,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  22,  2017,  as  National  Maritime  Day. 
I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  mark  this  observance  and 
to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  at  their  homes  and  in  their  commu-
nities.  I  also  request  that  all  ships  sailing  under  the  American  flag  dress 
ship on that day.

Proclamation  9657  of  October  6,  2017 

Leif  Erikson  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
More  than  a  thousand  years  ago,  explorer  Leif  Erikson—son  of  Iceland 
and  grandson  of  Norway—sailed  with  his  crew  to  Newfoundland,  Nova 
Scotia,  and  perhaps  even  as  far  west  as  Maine.  These  intrepid  explorers 
were  likely  the  first  Europeans  to  reach  our  great  home,  North  America. 
On  Leif  Erikson  Day,  we  celebrate  their  remarkable  journey  and  the  brave 
Viking culture that lies at the core of the New World’s passion for discovery 
and determination to tackle unimaginable challenges. 
Throughout  our  country’s  history,  Nordic  Americans  have  made  notable 
contributions to our society. From the everyday to the extraordinary, Nordic 
accomplishments  have  touched  every  aspect  of  our  lives.  We  owe  our  ham-
burgers  to  Danish-American  Louis  Lassen,  and  the  famed  St.  Louis  Arch 
to  Finnish-American  Eero  Saarinen.  Norwegian-American  and  cartoonist 
Charles  M.  Schulz  brought  us  the  Charlie  Brown,  Snoopy,  and  the  rest 
of the iconic Peanuts comic strip, and Finnish-American John Morton signed 
the Declaration of Independence. 
Today,  we  take  pride  in  our  strong  relationship  with  the  Nordic  countries. 
In  2016,  we  exported  $11  billion  in  goods  to  the  Nordics,  and  our  trading 
partnerships  in  the  region  are  only  growing  stronger.  The  Nordics  are  also 
staunch  allies  in  the  war  on  terrorism  and  are  valued  members  of  the 
Global  Coalition  to  Defeat  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria.  We  share 
in  their  sorrow  from  suffering  caused  by  terrorists  in  places  like  Turku, 
Stockholm, and Oslo. We stand together with the Nordic people in solidarity 
against the threat of terrorism. As we strive for peace, prosperity, and security, 
we  will  work  to  ensure  that  our  relationship  with  the  Nordic  countries 
continues to reflect the indomitable spirit of Leif Erikson. 
To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Con-
gress,  by  joint  resolution  (Public  Law  88–566)  approved  on  September  2, 
1964,  has  authorized  the  President  of  the  United  States  to  proclaim  October 
9 of each year as ‘‘Leif Erikson Day.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  9,  2017, 
as Leif Erikson Day. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements 
and contributions of Nordic Americans to our Nation with appropriate cere-
monies, activities, and programs.

Proclamation  9641  of  September  15,  2017 

National  Gang  Violence  Prevention  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every day, innocent Americans are the victims of terrible crimes perpetrated 
by violent gangs and criminal cartels. During National Gang Violence Preven-
tion Week, my Administration pledges to restore justice to American commu-
nities  and  keep  evil  off  our  streets  by  eradicating  the  gangs  that  commit 
these despicable acts. 
During the previous Administration, the number of gangs and gang members 
reached  an  alarming  20-year  high.  In  2015  alone,  homicides  spiked  by  17 
percent  in  America’s  50  largest  cities—the  largest  increase  in  25  years. 
Gangs  continue  to  evolve  and  adapt.  Today  they  have  expanded  to  almost 
1.5  million  members  nationwide  who  perpetrate  an  average  of  48  percent 
of  violent  crimes  in  most  jurisdictions  and  up  to  90  percent  in  others. 
My  Administration  will  not  stand  by  idly  as  these  menacing  gangs  threaten 
the safety and security of our communities. 
Particularly, we must address the rise of violent transnational criminal gangs, 
such  as  MS–13,  that  have  infiltrated  our  neighborhoods  and  recruited  our 
vulnerable  young  people.  Weak  border  security,  failure  to  enforce  immigra-
tion laws already on the books, and sanctuary cities have emboldened crimi-
nals  to  enter  the  United  States  illegally  and  enabled  gang  and  transnational 
cartel members to engage with impunity in illegal human and drug trafficking, 
corruption  and  fraud,  and  barbaric  acts  including  violence,  sexual  assaults, 
and murder. 
My Administration has pledged to identify and eradicate transnational orga-
nized crime, gangs, and gang violence. During my first 100 days as President, 
the  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement  Agency  led  a  coordinated  effort 
to  capture  more  than  30,000  convicted  criminal  aliens,  including  more  than 
1,000 gang members and affiliates. Many of these arrests were of immigration 
fugitives  who  had  committed  heinous  acts  of  gang  violence:  smuggling, 
sex  crimes,  arson,  extortion,  or  cruelty  to  innocent  children.  By  Executive 
Order,  I  also  created  the  Council  on  Transnational  Organized  Crime,  which 
has  been  hard  at  work  coordinating  Federal  resources  to  better  identify, 
prosecute,  and  dismantle  transnational  criminal  organizations.  As  a  result 
of  these  steps  and  the  new  partnerships  we  have  formed  at  all  levels  of 
government,  illegal  border  crossings  have  declined  drastically  since  I  took 
office. 
The Congress has also indicated a willingness to address this pressing issue. 
Yesterday,  the  House  passed  H.R.  3697,  the  Criminal  Alien  Gang  Member 
Removal  Act.  My  Administration  strongly  supports  this  legislation.  Once 
enacted,  it  will  protect  law-abiding  Americans  by  denying  criminal  alien 
gang  members  admission  into  the  United  States  and  by  giving  law  enforce-
ment  more  effective  tools  to  remove  them.  I  encourage  the  Senate  to  act 
quickly  to  enact  this  bill  into  law  and  help  protect  the  safety  of  Americans. 
This  week,  let  us  rededicate  ourselves  to  destroying  the  criminal  gangs 
that  have  plagued  American  neighborhoods  and  communities  for  far  too 
long.  We  owe  this  to  all  those  affected  by  gang  violence  and  to  all  who 
seek a brighter future.

Proclamation  9610  of  May  12,  2017 

National  Defense  Transportation  Day  and  National  Transpor-
tation  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Defense  Transportation  Day  and  National  Transportation 
Week,  we  celebrate  our  Nation’s  land,  air,  and  sea  infrastructure  systems. 
These  critical  systems  connect  Americans  to  one  another,  provide  vital  na-
tional  security  capabilities,  and  serve  as  a  cornerstone  of  our  economy. 
We  also  recognize  the  transportation  professionals  who  are  dedicated  to 
keeping  our  Nation’s  transportation  networks  secure,  efficient,  and  reliable. 
Quality  infrastructure  provides  Americans  with  the  freedom  they  need  and 
deserve to move themselves and their families, and the vast array of products 
they  want  to  buy  and  sell.  But  in  too  many  cases,  our  roads,  waterways, 
bridges,  airports,  and  mass  transit  systems  have  fallen  into  disrepair.  That 
is why my Administration is committed to rebuilding a world-class transpor-
tation infrastructure that works for all Americans. 
Revitalizing  our  infrastructure  is  all  the  more  important  because  American 
transportation enhancements have played and will continue to play a critical 
role  in  our  national  defense.  During  World  War  II,  our  ability  to  refuel 
ships  at  sea  was,  in  the  words  of  Admiral  Chester  Nimitz,  the  ‘‘Navy’s 
secret  weapon.’’  Today,  our  military  logistics  system  is  essential  to  the 
defense of our homeland and our ability to project power around the world. 
To  remain  effective,  the  transportation  industry  must  constantly  innovate. 
That is why, in addition to rebuilding our current infrastructure, my Adminis-
tration  is  removing  regulatory  hurdles  that  have,  for  too  long,  impeded 
necessary  infrastructure  improvements.  This  will  allow  creative  companies 
to  transform  how  we  use  our  roads,  waterways,  rails,  and  the  skies,  making 
them  both  safer  for  travelers  and  more  effective  for  our  national  security. 
To  recognize  the  men  and  women  who  work  in  the  transportation  industry 
and  who  contribute  to  our  Nation’s  well-being  and  defense,  the  Congress, 
by  joint  resolution  approved  May  16,  1957,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  120), 
has  designated  the  third  Friday  in  May  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National  Defense 
Transportation  Day,’’  and,  by  joint  resolution  approved  May  14,  1962,  as 
amended  (36  U.S.C.  133),  has  declared  that  the  week  during  which  that 
Friday falls be designated as ‘‘National Transportation Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  Friday,  May  19,  2017,  as  National  Defense 
Transportation Day and May 14 through May 20, 2017, as National Transpor-
tation  Week.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  celebrate  these  observances  with 
appropriate ceremonies and activities to learn more about how our transpor-
tation  system  contributes  to  the  security  of  our  citizens  and  the  prosperity 
of our Nation.

Proclamation  9419  of  April  8,  2016 

National  Volunteer  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Each  day,  humble  people  of  every  background  and  belief  come  together 
to fulfill the timeless responsibility we have as Americans: to accept certain 
obligations  to  one  another.  People  of  all  ages  can  volunteer,  and  anyone 
can,  through  the  smallest  of  acts,  do  their  part  to  improve  the  lives  of 
others.  This  week,  we  celebrate  the  selfless  individuals  around  our  country 
who  channel  their  civic  virtues  through  volunteerism,  and  we  encourage 
more people to make service an integral part of their lives. 

In  National  Parks  and  public  schools,  food  pantries  and  animal  shelters, 
volunteers fan out in communities across America, devoted to a cause bigger 
than  themselves.  In  crisis  and  disaster,  they  offer  not  only  goods  and  re-
sources,  but  also  understanding  and  sympathy  to  those  desperate  and  dis-
traught. In underserved neighborhoods, they help cultivate hope and inspira-
tion,  rolling  back  poverty  and  roadblocks  to  opportunity.  Generations  of 
these  often  unsung  heroes—driven  by  their  conviction  that  we  all  have 
a  stake  in  each  other—have  lifted  up  those  they  know  and  those  they 
do not, making our Nation and our world a better place. 

My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  giving  people  more  opportunities  to 
serve. I established a Task Force on Expanding National Service that supports 
the  expansion  of  service  and  volunteer  projects  to  address  some  of  our 
Nation’s highest priorities. Through the Corporation for National and Commu-
nity Service, AmeriCorps and Senior Corps have mobilized millions of Ameri-
cans,  sending  them  to  areas  in  need  of  dedicated  volunteers.  Under  these 
programs,  we  have  established  campaigns  that  address  specific  needs  in 
vulnerable  communities,  such  as  increasing  access  to  college,  improving 
STEM  education,  and  preserving  our  environment.  I  have  also  called  on 
200,000  Federal  scientists  and  engineers  to  help  mentor  young  people  in 
STEM  fields.  And  in  2014,  I  launched  the  Employers  of  National  Service 
initiative, connecting employers with AmeriCorps and Peace Corps alumni— 
because  often  the  most  talented,  tireless,  and  mission-driven  employees  are 
those  who  have  given  of  themselves  for  the  betterment  of  others.  In  the 
time  since,  hundreds  of  employers  have  signed  up  to  participate  in  this 
program. 

Volunteers  help  drive  our  country’s  progress,  and  day  in  and  day  out, 
they make extraordinary sacrifices to expand promise and possibility. During 
National  Volunteer  Week,  let  us  shed  the  cynicism  that  says  one  person 
cannot  make  a  difference  in  the  lives  of  others  by  embracing  each  of  our 
individual responsibilities to serve and shape a brighter future for all. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  10  through 
April  16,  2016,  as  National  Volunteer  Week.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  week  by  volunteering  in  service  projects  across  our  country 
and  pledging  to  make  service  a  part  of  their  daily  lives.  To  find  a  service 
opportunity nearby, visit www.Serve.gov.

Proclamation  9457  of  May  31,  2016 

Lesbian,  Gay,  Bisexual,  and  Transgender  Pride  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Since  our  founding,  America  has  advanced  on  an  unending  path  toward 
becoming a more perfect Union. This journey, led by forward-thinking indi-
viduals  who  have  set  their  sights  on  reaching  for  a  brighter  tomorrow, 
has never been easy or smooth. The fight for dignity and equality for lesbian, 
gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender  (LGBT)  people  is  reflected  in  the  tireless 
dedication  of  advocates  and  allies  who  strive  to  forge  a  more  inclusive 
society. They have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds 
and  by  demanding  equal  treatment—under  our  laws,  from  our  courts,  and 
in  our  politics.  This  month,  we  recognize  all  they  have  done  to  bring 
us  to  this  point,  and  we  recommit  to  bending  the  arc  of  our  Nation  toward 
justice. 
Last year’s landmark Supreme Court decision guaranteeing marriage equality 
in all 50 States was a historic victory for LGBT Americans, ensuring dignity 
for same-sex couples and greater equality across State lines. For every partner-
ship  that  was  not  previously  recognized  under  the  law  and  for  every  Amer-
ican who was denied their basic civil rights, this monumental ruling instilled 
newfound  hope,  affirming  the  belief  that  we  are  all  more  free  when  we 
are treated as equals. 
LGBT  individuals  deserve  to  know  their  country  stands  beside  them.  That 
is  why  my  Administration  is  striving  to  better  understand  the  needs  of 
LGBT  adults  and  to  provide  affordable,  welcoming,  and  supportive  housing 
to  aging  LGBT  Americans.  It  is  also  why  we  oppose  subjecting  minors 
to  the  harmful  practice  of  conversion  therapy,  and  why  we  are  continuing 
to  promote  equality  and  foster  safe  and  supportive  learning  environments 
for  all  students.  We  remain  committed  to  addressing  health  disparities  in 
the  LGBT  community—gay  and  bisexual  men  and  transgender  women  of 
color are at a particularly high risk for HIV, and we have worked to strengthen 
our  National  HIV/AIDS  Strategy  to  reduce  new  infections,  increase  access 
to care, and improve health outcomes for people living with HIV. 
Despite  the  extraordinary  progress  of  the  past  few  years,  LGBT  Americans 
still face discrimination simply for being who they are. I signed an Executive 
Order  in  2014  that  prohibits  discrimination  against  Federal  employees  and 
contractors  on  the  basis  of  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity.  I  urge 
the  Congress  to  enact  legislation  that  builds  upon  the  progress  we  have 
made,  because  no  one  should  live  in  fear  of  losing  their  job  simply  because 
of  who  they  are  or  who  they  love.  And  our  commitment  to  combatting 
discrimination  against  the  LGBT  community  does  not  stop  at  our  borders: 
Advancing  the  fair  treatment  of  all  people  has  long  been  a  cornerstone 
of  American  diplomacy,  and  we  have  made  defending  and  promoting  the 
human  rights  of  LGBT  individuals  a  priority  in  our  engagement  across 
the  globe.  In  line  with  America’s  commitment  to  the  notion  that  all  people 
should  be  treated  fairly  and  with  respect,  champions  of  this  cause  at  home 
and  abroad  are  upholding  the  simple  truth  that  LGBT  rights  are  human 
rights. 
There  remains  much  work  to  do  to  extend  the  promise  of  our  country 
to  every  American,  but  because  of  the  acts  of  courage  of  the  millions  who

came  out  and  spoke  out  to  demand  justice  and  of  those  who  quietly  toiled 
and  pushed  for  progress,  our  Nation  has  made  great  strides  in  recognizing 
what  these  brave  individuals  long  knew  to  be  true  in  their  hearts—that 
love  is  love  and  that  no  person  should  be  judged  by  anything  but  the 
content  of  their  character.  During  Lesbian,  Gay,  Bisexual,  and  Transgender 
Pride Month, as Americans wave their flags of pride high and march boldly 
forward  in  parades  and  demonstrations,  let  us  celebrate  how  far  we  have 
come and reaffirm our steadfast belief in the equal dignity of all Americans. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as Lesbian, 
Gay,  Bisexual,  and  Transgender  Pride  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of 
the United States to eliminate prejudice everywhere it exists, and to celebrate 
the great diversity of the American people. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of  May,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the  Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9446  of  May  13,  2016 

National  Defense  Transportation  Day  and  National  Transpor-
tation  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
At  the  core  of  our  national  character  is  our  persistent  belief  in  what  we, 
as a people, can accomplish as one. Connecting every corner of our country 
and each chapter of our Nation’s story, our infrastructure has always played 
a  critical  role  in  helping  us  solve  our  shared  challenges  and  in  fueling 
the innovation and productivity that drive our economy. On National Defense 
Transportation  Day  and  during  National  Transportation  Week,  we  reflect 
on the importance of infrastructure throughout our history, and we recognize 
the need to invest in these essential pathways to our future. 
From the National Road envisioned by our Founders to the Interstate Highway 
System first authorized six decades ago, the history of infrastructure projects 
in  our  country  reflects  the  belief  that  the  progress  made  by  each  generation 
is built on the efforts of those who came before. Our investments in transpor-
tation  systems  have  not  only  driven  extraordinary  and  innovative  advances, 
but  they  have  also  uplifted  our  Nation  in  times  of  great  trial.  Authorizing 
the  construction  of  hundreds  of  thousands  of  miles  of  roads,  the  Works 
Progress  Administration—established  by  President  Franklin  D.  Roosevelt— 
played  a  major  role  in  lifting  our  Nation  from  the  depths  of  the  Great 
Depression.  And  America  would  not  be  what  it  is  today  without  structures 
like  the  Golden  Gate  Bridge  and  the  Hoover  Dam—defining  symbols  of 
the daring ingenuity brought about by the grit and unwavering determination 
of our people. 
In  our  time,  it  is  imperative  that  we  carry  forward  this  legacy  by  rebuilding 
our  roads,  transit  lines,  bridges,  ports,  and  water  systems.  That  is  why 
my  Administration  has  worked  to  repair  and  modernize  our  transportation 
infrastructure;  connected  more  individuals,  businesses,  and  communities 
across  our  country  to  high-speed  broadband;  and  called  on  the  Congress 
to  commit  to  making  the  long-term  investments  in  our  infrastructure  on 
which  our  country  depends.  And  because  there  is  no  greater  threat  to  our 
planet  and  to  future  generations  than  the  peril  of  a  changing  climate,  I 
have  put  forward  a  plan  for  creating  a  21st  Century  Clean  Transportation 
System  to  put  us  on  a  course  to  develop  secure,  resilient  infrastructure 
that can reduce carbon pollution while strengthening our economy. 
Our  transportation  systems  represent  important  parts  of  our  history  and 
heritage,  but  they  are  also  critical  to  our  safety  and  security,  and  ensuring 
they are stable and sound for future generations is vital. Our first responders 
travel  our  roads  to  confront  danger  and  save  lives;  aid  workers  travel  far 
and  wide  to  bring  relief  in  the  wake  of  tragedy  and  devastation;  and  our 
Armed Forces utilize transportation networks each day to protect our Nation 
and our values. 
This  year,  we  mark  50  years  since  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  signed 
the  Department  of  Transportation  Act.  Embodying  both  optimism  for  the 
future  and  a  clear  understanding  of  the  work  needed  to  shape  that  future, 
the founding of the Department of Transportation reminds us that America’s 
progress  has  never  been  inevitable,  that  it  has  always  depended  on  our 
people  deciding,  with  boldness  and  vision,  to  renew  our  country’s  promise.

In  that  spirit,  let  us  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  fulfilling  this  tremendous 
task  in  the  face  of  the  challenges  and  opportunities  of  today  and  tomorrow. 
In recognition of the importance of our Nation’s transportation infrastructure, 
and  of  the  men  and  women  who  build,  operate,  maintain,  and  utilize  it, 
the  Congress  has  requested,  by  joint  resolution  approved  May  16,  1957, 
as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  120),  that  the  President  designate  the  third  Friday 
in  May  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National  Defense  Transportation  Day,’’  and,  by 
joint  resolution  approved  May  14,  1962,  as  amended  (36  U.S.C.  133),  that 
the week during which that Friday falls be designated as ‘‘National Transpor-
tation Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  Friday,  May  20,  2016,  as  National  Defense 
Transportation Day and May 15 through May 21, 2016, as National Transpor-
tation  Week.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  recognize  the  importance  of 
our  Nation’s  transportation  infrastructure  and  to  acknowledge  the  contribu-
tions of those who build, operate, and maintain it. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirteenth  day 
of  May,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the  Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  a  mark  of  respect  for  Antonin  Scalia,  Associate  Justice  of  the  United 
States,  I  hereby  order,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

Federal  Government  in  the  District  of  Columbia  and  throughout  the  United

Proclamation  9443  of  May  6,  2016 

National  Women’s  Health  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Throughout  our  history,  women  have  contributed  to  shaping  the  course 
of  our  country—and  with  each  generation,  they  have  helped  affirm  the 
timeless  belief  that  everyone  deserves  an  equal  shot  at  reaching  for  our 
Nation’s  promise.  We  have  achieved  great  progress  in  tearing  down  barriers 
that  deny  women  equal  opportunities,  but  we  still  have  more  to  do  to 
ensure  that  health  care  is  a  right  for  every  American,  regardless  of  sex 
or  gender.  This  week,  we  recommit  to  ensuring  equal  access  to  high-quality 
care for women and to building a more prosperous, healthy future. 

Ensuring  women  can  live  full  and  healthy  lives  is  vital,  and  central  to 
that  mission  is  improving  the  quality,  affordability,  and  accessibility  of 
health care for women. Because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurance 
companies  can  no  longer  charge  women  more  than  men  or  use  preexisting 
conditions—including pregnancy—to deny them the care they need. 

Twenty  million  Americans  have  gained  health  insurance  since  the  passage 
of  the  ACA,  including  roughly  9.5  million  women  since  the  first  open 
enrollment  period  in  2013.  Under  the  Act,  annual  limits  on  out-of-pocket 
spending  for  essential  health  benefits  have  been  established,  and  lifetime 
and  annual  limits  on  insurance  coverage  have  been  eliminated.  For  55 
million  women,  critical  preventive  services,  including  well-woman  visits, 
certain  cancer  screenings,  and  domestic  violence  screenings  and  counseling 
sessions,  are  now  guaranteed  with  no  out-of-pocket  costs.  Access  to  preven-
tive care can help identify and diagnose conditions early, benefiting countless 
women across our Nation. 

The  important  decisions  that  affect  a  woman’s  health  should  be  left  to 
her alone. Today, efforts around our country to weaken access to contracep-
tion  and  to  limit  a  woman’s  right  to  choose  threaten  to  reverse  decades 
of  hard-won  progress.  It  is  crucial  we  reject  actions  that  obstruct  women’s 
access to sexual and reproductive health services and stand firm in protecting 
their  access  to  safe,  affordable  health  care  and  the  constitutional  right  to 
privacy, including the right to reproductive freedom. 

National Women’s Health Week is an opportunity to refocus our commitment 
to  advancing  women’s  health  and  ensuring  a  healthy  future  for  all  our 
Nation’s  women  and  girls.  To  learn  more  about  women’s  health,  and  for

Proclamation  9499  of  September  16,  2016 

Prescription  Opioid  and  Heroin  Epidemic  Awareness  Week, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Each year, more Americans die from drug overdoses than in traffic accidents, 
and  more  than  three  out  of  five  of  these  deaths  involve  an  opioid.  Since 
1999,  the  number  of  overdose  deaths  involving  opioids,  including  prescrip-
tion  opioid  pain  relievers,  heroin,  and  fentanyl,  has  nearly  quadrupled. 
Many people who die from an overdose struggle with an opioid use disorder 
or  other  substance  use  disorder,  and  unfortunately  misconceptions  sur-
rounding  these  disorders  have  contributed  to  harmful  stigmas  that  prevent 
individuals  from  seeking  evidence-based  treatment.  During  Prescription 
Opioid  and  Heroin  Epidemic  Awareness  Week,  we  pause  to  remember  all 
those  we  have  lost  to  opioid  use  disorder,  we  stand  with  the  courageous 
individuals  in  recovery,  and  we  recognize  the  importance  of  raising  aware-
ness of this epidemic. 
Opioid  use  disorder,  or  addiction  to  prescription  opioids  or  heroin,  is  a 
disease  that  touches  too  many  of  our  communities—big  and  small,  urban 
and  rural—and  devastates  families,  all  while  straining  the  capacity  of  law 
enforcement  and  the  health  care  system.  States  and  localities  across  our 
country,  in  collaboration  with  Federal  and  national  partners,  are  working 
together to address this issue through innovative partnerships between public 
safety and public health professionals. The Federal Government is bolstering 
efforts  to  expand  treatment  and  opioid  abuse  prevention  activities,  and  we 
are working alongside law enforcement to help get more people into treatment 
instead of jail. 
My Administration is steadfast in its commitment to reduce overdose deaths 
and  get  more  Americans  the  help  they  need.  That  is  why  I  continue  to 
call  on  the  Congress  to  provide  $1.1  billion  to  expand  access  to  treatment 
services  for  opioid  use  disorder.  These  new  investments  would  build  on 
the  steps  we  have  already  taken  to  expand  overdose  prevention  strategies, 
and  increase  access  to  naloxone—the  overdose  reversal  drug  that  first  re-
sponders  and  community  members  are  using  to  save  lives.  We  are  also 
working to improve opioid prescribing practices and support targeted enforce-
ment  activities.  Although  Federal  agencies  will  continue  using  all  available 
tools  to  address  opioid  use  disorder  and  overdose,  the  Congress  must  act 
quickly  to  help  more  individuals  get  the  treatment  they  need—because  the 
longer we go without congressional action on this funding, the more opportu-
nities we miss to save lives. 
Too  often,  we  expect  people  struggling  with  substance  use  disorders  to 
self-diagnose  and  seek  treatment.  And  although  we  have  made  great  strides 
in  helping  more  Americans  access  care,  far  too  many  still  lack  appropriate, 
evidence-based treatment. This week, we reaffirm our commitment to raising 
awareness  about  this  disease  and  supporting  prevention  and  treatment  pro-
grams.  Let  us  ensure  everyone  with  an  opioid  use  disorder  can  embark 
on  the  road  to  recovery,  and  together,  let  us  begin  to  turn  the  tide  of 
this epidemic. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

Notice  of  October  31,  2016 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Sudan 

On  November  3,  1997,  by  Executive  Order  13067,  the  President  declared 
a national emergency with respect to Sudan and, pursuant to the International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706),  took  related  steps 
to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security 
and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  posed  by  the  actions  and  policies 
of  the  Government  of  Sudan.  On  April  26,  2006,  in  Executive  Order  13400, 
the  President  determined  that  the  conflict  in  Sudan’s  Darfur  region  posed 
an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign 
policy  of  the  United  States,  expanded  the  scope  of  the  national  emergency 
to  deal  with  that  threat,  and  ordered  the  blocking  of  property  of  certain 
persons connected to the conflict. On October 13, 2006, the President issued 
Executive  Order  13412  to  take  additional  steps  with  respect  to  the  national 
emergency  and  to  implement  the  Darfur  Peace  and  Accountability  Act  of 
2006 (Public Law 109–344). 

The  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  Sudan  continue  to  pose 
an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign 
policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared 
in  Executive  Order  13067  of  November  3,  1997,  expanded  on  April  26, 
2006,  and  with  respect  to  which  additional  steps  were  taken  on  October 
13,  2006,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  November  3,  2016.  Therefore, 
consistent  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  with  respect 
to Sudan declared in Executive Order 13067. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9548  of  November  30,  2016 

World  AIDS  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Thirty-five  years  ago  the  first  documented  cases  of  AIDS  brought  about 
an  era  of  uncertainty,  fear,  and  discrimination.  HIV/AIDS  has  taken  tens 
of  millions  of  lives—and  far  too  many  people  with  HIV  have  struggled 
to  get  the  care,  treatment,  and  compassion  they  deserve.  But  in  the  decades 
since  those  first  cases,  with  ingenuity,  leadership,  research,  and  historic 
investments  in  evidence-based  practices,  we  have  begun  to  move  toward 
an  era  of  resilience  and  hope—and  we  are  closer  than  ever  to  reaching 
an AIDS-free generation. On World AIDS Day, we join with the international 
community to remember those we have lost too soon, reflect on the tremen-
dous  progress  we  have  made  in  battling  this  disease,  and  carry  forward 
our fight against HIV/AIDS. 
By  shining  a  light  on  this  issue  and  educating  more  communities  about 
the importance of testing and treatment, we have saved and improved lives. 
Although  we  have  come  far  in  recent  decades,  our  work  is  not  yet  done 
and  the  urgency  to  intervene  in  this  epidemic  is  critical.  In  the  United 
States,  more  than  1.2  million  people  are  living  with  HIV.  Gay  and  bisexual 
men,  transgender  people,  youth,  black  and  Latino  Americans,  people  living 
in the Southern United States, and people who inject drugs are at a dispropor-
tionate  risk.  People  living  with  HIV  can  face  stigma  and  discrimination, 
creating barriers to prevention and treatment services. 
My Administration has made significant efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, including 
by  encouraging  treatment  as  prevention,  expanding  access  to  pre-exposure 
prophylaxis,  eliminating  waiting  lists  for  medication  assistance  programs, 
and  working  toward  a  vaccine.  Thanks  to  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  no  one 
can  be  denied  coverage  for  pre-existing  conditions  like  HIV,  and  millions 
of  people  can  now  access  quality,  affordable  health  insurance  plans  that 
cover important services like HIV testing and screening. In 2010, I introduced 
the  first  comprehensive  National  HIV/AIDS  Strategy  in  the  United  States, 
and last year, through an Executive Order, I updated it to serve as a guiding 
path to 2020. This update builds on the primary goals of the original Strategy, 
including  reducing  the  number  of  HIV-infected  individuals  and  HIV-related 
health  disparities,  improving  health  outcomes  for  anyone  living  with  HIV 
and  increasing  their  access  to  care,  and  strengthening  our  coordinated  na-
tional response to this epidemic. 
Currently,  more  than  36  million  people,  including  1.8  million  children, 
are  living  with  HIV/AIDS  across  the  globe,  and  the  majority  of  people 
living  with  HIV  reside  in  low-  to  middle-income  countries.  We  need  to 
do  more  to  reach  those  who  are  at  risk  for  contracting  HIV/AIDS,  and 
the  United  States  is  helping  shape  the  world’s  response  to  this  crisis  and 
working  alongside  the  international  community  to  end  this  epidemic  by 
2030.  We  have  strengthened  and  expanded  the  President’s  Emergency  Plan 
for  AIDS  Relief  (PEPFAR),  with  now  more  than  $70  billion  invested,  to 
accelerate  our  progress  and  work  to  control  this  epidemic  with  comprehen-
sive and data-focused efforts. With PEPFAR support for more than 11 million 
people  on  life-saving  treatment  and  through  contributions  to  the  Global 
Fund  to  Fight  AIDS,  Tuberculosis,  and  Malaria—including  a  new  pledge

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  232 / Friday,  December  2,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

of  more  than  $4  billion  through  2019—there  are  now  more  than  18  million 
people getting HIV treatment and care. Because in sub-Saharan Africa young 
women  and  adolescent  girls  are  over  eight  times  more  likely  to  get  HIV/ 
AIDS  than  young  men,  we  launched  a  comprehensive  prevention  program 
to  reduce  HIV  infections  among  this  population  in  10  sub-Saharan  African 
countries. This summer, PEPFAR established an innovative investment fund 
to  expand  access  to  quality  HIV/AIDS  services  for  key  populations  affected 
by  the  epidemic  and  reduce  the  stigma  and  discrimination  that  persists. 
We have also helped prevent millions of new infections worldwide, including 
in  more  than  1.5  million  babies  of  HIV-positive  mothers  who  were  born 
free  of  HIV.  By  translating  groundbreaking  research  and  scientific  tools  into 
action, for the first time we are seeing early but promising signs of controlling 
the spread of HIV. 
Accelerating  the  progress  we  have  made  will  require  sustained  commitment 
and passion from every sector of society and across every level of government 
around  the  world.  A  future  where  no  individual  has  to  suffer  from  HIV/ 
AIDS  is  within  our  reach,  and  today,  we  recommit  to  ensuring  the  next 
generation  has  the  tools  they  need  to  continue  fighting  this  disease.  Let 
us strive to support all people living with HIV/AIDS and rededicate ourselves 
to  ending  this  epidemic  once  and  for  all.  Together,  we  can  achieve  what 
once  seemed  impossible  and  give  more  people  the  chance  at  a  longer, 
brighter, AIDS-free future. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  December  1,  2016, 
as World AIDS Day. I urge the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth 
of  Puerto  Rico,  officials  of  the  other  territories  subject  to  the  jurisdiction 
of  the  United  States,  and  the  American  people  to  join  me  in  appropriate 
activities  to  remember  those  who  have  lost  their  lives  to  AIDS  and  to 
provide support and compassion to those living with HIV. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirtieth  day 
of  November,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Proclamation  9553  of  December  9,  2016 

Human  Rights  Day  and  Human  Rights  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted on December 
10,  1948,  it  set  in  motion  a  movement  to  secure  liberty  and  justice  for 
all  people.  Out  of  the  ashes  of  the  Second  World  War,  the  United  Nations 
General  Assembly  proclaimed  that  ‘‘All  human  beings  are  born  free  and 
equal  in  dignity  and  rights.’’  On  Human  Rights  Day  and  during  Human 
Rights  Week,  we  reflect  on  how  far  we  have  come  in  upholding  these 
universal rights and resolve to continue fighting to safeguard them wherever 
they are threatened. 

In  the  last  few  decades,  our  world  has  made  great  strides  in  advancing 
human  rights  and  the  institutions  that  protect  them.  More  countries  have 
pursued self-government and democracy—and more people are electing their 
leaders freely and fairly and holding their governments accountable through 
calls  for  increased  transparency.  Around  the  world,  the  United  States  has 
promoted  freedom:  We  have  worked  to  expand  the  protection  of  human 
rights,  end  gender-based  violence,  and  defend  the  freedoms  of  expression, 
peaceful  assembly,  and  the  press.  In  promoting  these  liberties  and  pushing 
back  against  tyranny,  corruption,  and  oppression,  we  have  recognized  that 
universal human rights and fundamental freedoms do not stop at our borders. 
They are the birthright of people everywhere. 

History ultimately moves in the direction of justice and inclusion, but despite 
the  great  progress  we  have  made,  unprecedented  and  rapid  change  has 
posed  great  challenges.  It  is  our  collective  duty  to  continue  striving  for 
a  world  where  nobody  is  left  behind,  forgotten,  or  mistreated,  and  where 
all  nations  recognize  that  societies  that  draw  on  the  contributions  of  every 
citizen  are  stronger.  Far  too  many  people  around  the  world  are  still  denied 
their  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms,  and  we  must  work  to  end 
the  discrimination  that  is  too  often  felt  by  LGBT  individuals,  people  with 
disabilities,  immigrants,  women  and  girls  of  all  ages,  and  members  of  reli-
gious,  ethnic,  and  other  minorities.  And  we  must  strengthen  our  ongoing 
efforts to rid the world of violence, oppression, and hatred. 

Our  relationships  to  one  another—person  to  person,  nation  to  nation—are 
defined  not  by  our  differences,  but  by  our  shared  belief  in  the  ideals  en-
shrined  in  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights.  As  we  observe  the 
anniversary  of  the  affirmation  that  inalienable  rights  exist  for  every  indi-
vidual, we vow to ensure these rights are afforded to every person. Together, 
let  us  continue  striving  to  stamp  out  all  forms  of  injustice  and  promote 
dignity, humanity, and respect around the world. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  December  10,  2016, 
as Human Rights Day and the week beginning December 10, 2016, as Human 
Rights  Week.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United  States  to  mark  these 
observances with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

Proclamation  9535  of  October  31,  2016 

National  Entrepreneurship  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Entrepreneurs in America have long lent their talents and passions to solving 
problems,  generating  growth  and  prosperity,  and  turning  dreams  into  new 
goods  and  services  for  people  across  our  Nation  and  around  the  world. 
During  National  Entrepreneurship  Month,  we  celebrate  the  entrepreneurs 
who  serve  their  communities  and  bolster  our  economy,  and  we  pledge 
our support for them in their pursuit of the ideas and innovations of tomor-
row. 
Through their intrepid sense of possibility and resilience, and their unwilling-
ness  to  give  in  or  give  up,  entrepreneurs  from  every  walk  of  life  make 
invaluable  contributions  to  the  American  experience—turning  bold  ideas 
into  real  progress.  My  Administration  has  made  it  a  priority  from  day 
one  to  support  those  who  take  a  risk  and  put  in  the  hard  work  required 
to  get  a  new  venture  off  the  ground.  In  2010,  I  signed  the  Affordable 
Care  Act,  which  gives  Americans  greater  opportunities  to  start  businesses 
by offering portable and affordable health insurance plans through the Health 
Insurance  Marketplace.  I  signed  18  tax  breaks  for  small  businesses  in  my 
first  term,  including  tax  credits  for  those  who  hire  unemployed  workers 
and  veterans,  and  I  launched  the  Nation  of  Makers  initiative  to  advance 
innovation  and  encourage  making,  including  homegrown  technologies  and 
startups.  In  2013,  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  to  make  Government  data 
more accessible to the public, and my Administration has opened up nearly 
200,000  datasets  on  www.Data.gov  to  fuel  economic  growth,  innovation, 
and  entrepreneurship.  And  earlier  this  year,  I  announced  the  Computer 
Science for All Initiative—a plan to give all students in America the chance 
to  learn  computer  science  in  school,  which  will  equip  our  future  entre-
preneurs, including those from underrepresented backgrounds, with the com-
putational thinking skills they need to succeed. 
In  the  21st-century  economy—where  business  does  not  stop  at  a  country’s 
border  and  where  technological  advancements  have  changed  the  ways  we 
engage  in  commerce  and  with  one  another—it  is  more  important  than  ever 
that  we  give  our  Nation’s  entrepreneurs  the  tools  and  resources  they  need 
to compete on the international stage. This past summer, I signed an Execu-
tive Order that encourages entrepreneurship in the United States and around 
the world, including through the Presidential Ambassadors for Global Entre-
preneurship  Program,  to  promote  the  sharing  of  knowledge  and  experience 
with  the  entrepreneurs  of  tomorrow.  Additionally,  as  I  attended  the  Global 
Entrepreneurship  Summit  in  California  in  June,  companies  across  America 
came  together  to  sign  the  Tech  Inclusion  Pledge:  a  commitment  to  making 
their  technology  workforces  more  representative  of  the  American  people. 
My  Administration  also  used  this  Summit  as  an  opportunity  to  announce 
an expansion of the National Science Foundation’s Innovation Corps training 
program  for  entrepreneurial  scientists  and  engineers,  as  well  as  the  Small 
Business Administration’s Startup in a Day initiative, with nearly 100 cities 
and  communities  across  our  Nation  committed  to  streamlining  licensing, 
permitting,  and  other  requirements  necessary  for  anyone  to  start  a  business. 
At the end of last year, I signed a bipartisan budget deal that made permanent 
critical  tax  incentives  to  help  bolster  investment  in  small  businesses  and

research  and  experimentation,  including  by  startups  and  other  innovative 
companies.  And  thanks  to  another  bipartisan  bill  I  signed,  entrepreneurs 
can  raise  small-dollar  investments  from  community  members,  customers, 
and other individuals through new and regulated online crowdfunding plat-
forms—because access to capital should be available to every aspiring entre-
preneur no matter who they are or where they are from. 
My  Administration  has  also  striven  to  expand  opportunity  to  those  seeking 
to  utilize  their  entrepreneurial  talents  abroad.  Following  the  beginning  of 
our  process  to  normalize  relations  with  our  neighbors  90  miles  to  the  south 
in  Cuba,  we  made  it  easier  for  Cuban  entrepreneurs  to  import  and  export. 
Entrepreneurs  flourish  when  they  are  surrounded  by  an  environment  that 
encourages  their  success—that  is  true  here  at  home  and  around  the  world. 
My  Administration  remains  committed  to  implementing  the  Trans-Pacific 
Partnership,  a  trade  agreement  that  will  have  a  profound  effect  on  our 
efforts  to  support  online  entrepreneurs  and  enable  American  entrepreneurs 
to  sell  ‘‘Made  in  America’’  products  all  over  the  world.  And  through  our 
proposed  International  Entrepreneur  Rule,  we  are  working  to  ensure  the 
world’s  best  and  brightest  entrepreneurs  can  launch  companies  and  create 
jobs in the United States. 
As  we  celebrate  National  Entrepreneurship  Month  and  Global  Entrepreneur-
ship  Week,  let  us  resolve  to  support  those  budding  entrepreneurs  looking 
to  use  their  ideas  and  expertise  to  build  a  better  life  for  themselves  and 
their  families—and  let  us  tap  into  the  diverse  skills  and  talents  across 
our country so that entrepreneurs from all backgrounds can continue creating 
the businesses of the 21st century. Entrepreneurship is about the opportunity 
to  forge  one’s  own  future,  and  an  investment  in  that  future  can  start  as 
something  small  and  turn  into  something  great.  That  is  the  legacy  shaped 
by  generations  of  American  entrepreneurs  who,  through  ingenuity,  passion, 
and self-determination, have always striven to achieve the next big, unknown 
thing. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as National Entrepreneurship Month. I call upon all Americans to commemo-
rate  this  month  with  appropriate  programs  and  activities,  and  to  celebrate 
November 15, 2016, as National Entrepreneurs’ Day. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9437  of  April  29,  2016 

National  Charter  Schools  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Our  Nation  has  always  been  guided  by  the  belief  that  all  young  people 
should  be  free  to  dream  as  big  and  boldly  as  they  want,  and  that  with 
hard  work  and  determination,  they  can  turn  their  dreams  into  realities. 
Schools  help  us  uphold  this  ideal  by  offering  a  place  for  children  to  grow, 
learn,  and  thrive.  During  National  Charter  Schools  Week,  we  celebrate  the 
role  of  high-quality  public  charter  schools  in  helping  to  ensure  students 
are  prepared  and  able  to  seize  their  piece  of  the  American  dream,  and 
we honor the dedicated professionals across America who make this calling 
their life’s work by serving in charter schools. 

Charter  schools  play  an  important  role  in  our  country’s  education  system. 
Supporting  some  of  our  Nation’s  underserved  communities,  they  can  ignite 
imagination and nourish the minds of America’s young people while finding 
new  ways  of  educating  them  and  equipping  them  with  the  knowledge  they 
need  to  succeed.  With  the  flexibility  to  develop  new  methods  for  educating 
our youth, and to develop remedies that could help underperforming schools, 
these  innovative  and  autonomous  public  schools  often  offer  lessons  that 
can be applied in other institutions of learning across our country, including 
in  traditional  public  schools.  We  also  must  ensure  our  charter  schools, 
like  all  our  schools,  are  of  high  quality  and  are  held  accountable—when 
a  charter  school  does  not  meet  high  standards,  we  need  to  act  in  the 
best  interest  of  its  students  to  help  it  improve,  and  if  that  does  not  prove 
possible, to close its doors. 

Charter  schools  have  been  at  the  forefront  of  innovation  and  have  found 
different  ways  of  engaging  students  in  their  high  school  years—including 
by  providing  personalized  instruction,  leveraging  technology,  and  giving 
students  greater  access  to  rigorous  coursework  and  college-level  courses. 
Over  the  past  7  years,  my  Administration’s  commitment  of  resources  to 
the  growth  of  charter  schools  has  enabled  a  significant  expansion  of  edu-
cational  opportunity,  enabling  tens  of  thousands  of  children  to  attend  high- 
quality public charter schools. I am committed to ensuring all of our Nation’s 
students  have  the  tools  and  skills  they  need  to  get  ahead,  and  that  begins 
with  ensuring  they  are  able  to  attend  an  effective  school  and  obtain  an 
excellent education. 

Educating  every  American  student  and  ensuring  they  graduate  from  high 
school  prepared  for  college  and  beyond  is  a  national  priority.  This  week, 
we honor the educators working in public charter schools across our Nation 
who,  each  day,  give  of  themselves  to  provide  children  a  fair  shot  at  the 
American dream, and we recommit to the basic promise that all our daughters 
and sons—regardless of background or circumstance—should be able to make 
of their lives what they will. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  1  through 
May  7,  2016,  as  National  Charter  Schools  Week.  I  commend  our  Nation’s

Proclamation  9417  of  April  1,  2016 

World  Autism  Awareness  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  person  deserves  the  chance  to  reach  for  their  highest  hopes  and 
fulfill their greatest potential. On World Autism Awareness Day, we reaffirm 
our  dedication  to  ensuring  that  belief  is  a  reality  for  all  those  who  live 
on  the  autism  spectrum—including  1  in  68  children.  And  we  uphold  our 
obligation  to  help  make  sure  every  man,  woman,  and  child,  regardless  of 
ability  or  background,  is  accepted  for  who  they  are  and  able  to  lead  a 
life free from discrimination and filled with opportunity. 
From home to school and in businesses and communities around the world, 
people  living  with  autism  spectrum  disorder  contribute  in  immeasurable 
ways  to  our  society.  They  remind  us  each  day  that  every  person  is  born 
with  unique  talents  and  should  be  treated  with  respect,  play  an  active 
role  in  planning  for  their  futures,  and  feel  empowered  to  fully  participate 
in and contribute to their communities. When those with autism have access 
to  equal  opportunities,  we  all  do  better,  and  that  begins  with  making  sure 
our  country  lives  up  to  its  commitment  to  ensure  all  things  are  possible 
for all people. 
Individuals  with  autism  are  just  as  deserving  of  the  peace  of  mind  that 
comes  with  having  quality,  affordable  health  insurance  as  anyone  else.  The 
Affordable  Care  Act  helps  ensure  no  person  is  prevented  from  obtaining 
health  coverage  simply  because  they  live  with  a  preexisting  condition  like 
autism,  and  it  requires  most  plans  to  cover  recommended  preventive  serv-
ices—including critical screenings that test for autism in children. My Admin-
istration  is  dedicated  to  ensuring  educational  opportunities  for  autistic  stu-
dents are worthy of their extraordinary potential and to providing Americans 
with  autism  the  chance  to  earn  good  jobs  and  hone  their  skills  and  talents. 
We are working to break down barriers to competitive, integrated employment 
for  people  with  disabilities,  including  people  with  autism.  We  are  also 
promoting  inclusivity  for  kids  with  autism  in  high-quality,  early  childhood 
education programs. In 2014, I signed the Autism CARES Act, which supports 
autism-related  research  and  helps  us  to  better  understand  the  particular 
challenges faced by students and young adults living on the autism spectrum. 
And this month marks 3 years since my Administration launched the BRAIN 
Initiative—a  collaborative  effort  by  Federal  agencies,  philanthropies,  univer-
sities,  foundations,  and  others  in  the  medical  and  scientific  communities 
that aims to accelerate our work to solve some of the most intricate mysteries 
of human brain function and reveal new insights into conditions like autism. 
In my most recent budget proposal, I was proud to support increased funding 
for this important initiative. 
Americans  with  autism  play  an  important  role  in  our  national  story,  and 
in  their  daily  lives  they  embody  the  belief  at  the  heart  of  our  founding: 
that  in  America,  with  hard  work  and  equal  access,  all  people  can  realize 
their  aspirations.  Today,  and  every  day,  let  us  reach  for  a  future  in  which 
no  person  living  on  the  autism  spectrum  is  limited  by  anything  but  the 
size  of  their  dreams—one  in  which  all  people  have  the  opportunity  to 
live  a  life  filled  with  a  sense  of  identity,  purpose,  and  self-determination.

Proclamation  9402  of  February  29,  2016 

Women’s  History  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Throughout  history,  women  have  driven  humanity  forward  on  the  path 
to  a  more  equal  and  just  society,  contributing  in  innumerable  ways  to 
our  character  and  progress  as  a  people.  In  the  face  of  discrimination  and 
undue  hardship,  they  have  never  given  up  on  the  promise  of  America: 
that  with  hard  work  and  determination,  nothing  is  out  of  reach.  During 
Women’s History Month, we remember the trailblazers of the past, including 
the  women  who  are  not  recorded  in  our  history  books,  and  we  honor 
their  legacies  by  carrying  forward  the  valuable  lessons  learned  from  the 
powerful examples they set. 
For  too  long,  women  were  formally  excluded  from  full  participation  in 
our  society  and  our  democracy.  Because  of  the  courage  of  so  many  bold 
women  who  dared  to  transcend  preconceived  expectations  and  prove  they 
were  capable  of  doing  all  that  a  man  could  do  and  more,  advances  were 
made,  discoveries  were  revealed,  barriers  were  broken,  and  progress  tri-
umphed.  Whether  serving  in  elected  positions  across  America,  leading 
groundbreaking  civil  rights  movements,  venturing  into  unknown  frontiers, 
or programming revolutionary technologies, generations of women that knew 
their  gender  was  no  obstacle  to  what  they  could  accomplish  have  long 
stirred  new  ideas  and  opened  new  doors,  having  a  profound  and  positive 
impact  on  our  Nation.  Through  hardship  and  strife  and  in  every  realm 
of  life,  women  have  spurred  change  in  communities  around  the  world, 
steadfastly  joining  together  to  overcome  adversity  and  lead  the  charge  for 
a fairer, more inclusive, and more progressive society. 
During  Women’s  History  Month,  we  honor  the  countless  women  who  sac-
rificed  and  strived  to  ensure  all  people  have  an  equal  shot  at  pursuing 
the  American  dream.  As  President,  the  first  bill  I  signed  into  law  was 
the  Lilly  Ledbetter  Fair  Pay  Act,  making  it  easier  for  working  American 
women to effectively challenge illegal, unequal pay disparities. Additionally, 
my  Administration  proposed  collecting  pay  data  from  businesses  to  shine 
a  light  on  pay  discrimination,  and  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  to  ensure 
the Federal Government only works with and awards contracts to businesses 
that  follow  laws  that  uphold  fair  and  equal  labor  practices.  Thanks  to  the 
Affordable  Care  Act,  insurance  companies  can  no  longer  charge  women 
more  for  health  insurance  simply  because  of  their  gender.  And  last  year, 
we  officially  opened  for  women  the  last  jobs  left  unavailable  to  them  in 
our  military,  because  one  of  the  best  ways  to  ensure  our  Armed  Forces 
remains  the  strongest  in  the  world  is  to  draw  on  the  talents  and  skills 
of all Americans. 
Though  we  have  made  great  progress  toward  achieving  gender  equality, 
work  remains  to  be  done.  Women  still  earn,  on  average,  less  for  every 
dollar  made  by  men,  which  is  why  I  continue  to  call  on  the  Congress 
to  pass  the  Paycheck  Fairness  Act—a  sensible  step  to  provide  women  with 
basic  tools  to  fight  pay  discrimination.  Meanwhile,  my  Administration  has 
taken  steps  to  support  working  families  by  fighting  for  paid  leave  for  all 
Americans, providing women with more small business loans and opportuni-
ties,  and  addressing  the  challenges  still  faced  by  women  and  girls  of  color,

who consistently face wider opportunity gaps and structural barriers—includ-
ing  greater  discrepancies  in  pay.  And  although  the  majority  of  our  Nation’s 
college  and  graduate  students  are  women,  they  are  still  underrepresented 
in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  mathematics,  which  is  why  we 
are  encouraging  more  women  and  girls  to  pursue  careers  in  these  fields. 
This  May,  the  White  House  will  host  a  summit  on  ‘‘The  United  State 
of  Women,’’  to  highlight  the  advances  we  have  made  in  the  United  States 
and  across  the  globe  and  to  expand  our  efforts  on  helping  women  confront 
the  challenges  they  face  and  reach  for  their  highest  aspirations.  We  must 
strive  to  build  the  future  we  want  our  children  to  inherit—one  in  which 
their  dreams  are  not  deferred  or  denied,  but  where  they  are  uplifted  and 
praised.  We  have  come  far,  but  there  is  still  far  to  go  in  shattering  the 
glass  ceiling  that  holds  women  back.  This  month,  as  we  reflect  on  the 
marks  made  by  women  throughout  history,  let  us  uphold  the  responsibility 
that falls on all of us—regardless of gender—and fight for equal opportunity 
for our daughters as well as our sons. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  2016  as 
Women’s  History  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month 
and  to  celebrate  International  Women’s  Day  on  March  8,  2016,  with  appro-
priate  programs,  ceremonies,  and  activities.  I  also  invite  all  Americans  to 
visit  www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov  to  learn  more  about  the  generations 
of women who have left enduring imprints on our history. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  February,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and 
fortieth.

Proclamation  9522  of  October  7,  2016 

International  Day  of  the  Girl,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
No  matter  where  she  lives,  every  girl  on  this  planet  deserves  the  chance 
to  learn  and  grow,  to  develop  her  mind  and  her  talents,  and  to  live  a 
life  of  her  own  choosing.  Although  we  have  made  life  significantly  better 
for  our  daughters  than  it  was  for  our  mothers  and  grandmothers,  in  too 
many  parts  of  the  world,  girls  are  still  undervalued,  disrespected,  abused, 
and  prevented  from  contributing  to  society.  On  International  Day  of  the 
Girl,  we  recognize  our  obligation  to  lift  up  women  and  girls  at  home  and 
abroad  and  to  build  a  world  where  all  girls  feel  safe  and  empowered  in 
their classrooms, their communities, and their homes. 
My Administration is committed to combating gender disparities, and through 
the  White  House  Council  on  Women  and  Girls,  we  have  made  it  a  priority 
to consider the needs of women and girls in our policies, laws, and programs. 
Today, more American women have the freedom to make their own choices 
about their lives—about their bodies, their education, their career. The Afford-
able  Care  Act  has  ensured  that  more  girls  have  access  to  quality,  affordable 
health care and that no health insurer can charge them more simply because 
of  their  gender.  By  encouraging  the  media  to  depict  more  examples  of 
women  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math  (STEM)  fields—and 
by  working  to  expand  access  to  STEM  classes  and  careers,  particularly 
computer  science—we  are  striving  to  address  inequalities  in  education.  We 
will  continue  to  pursue  policies  that  advance  gender  equality  here  at  home, 
from  equal  pay  for  equal  work  to  protecting  reproductive  rights,  because 
while  some  girls  have  never  had  more  opportunities,  there  are  still  many 
who remain in the toughest of circumstances. 
Under  the  leadership  of  Vice  President  Joe  Biden,  we  are  working  to  put 
an  end  to  violence  against  women,  and  we  have  launched  a  movement 
to  fight  sexual  assault  and  support  survivors.  Through  the  White  House 
Task  Force  to  Protect  Students  from  Sexual  Assault  and  the  ‘‘It’s  On  Us’’ 
campaign,  we  are  shining  a  light  on  the  unconscionable  rates  of  sexual 
assault  against  teens  and  young  adults  in  primary  and  secondary  schools 
and on college campuses. My Administration recently announced new guid-
ance  and  resources  to  help  district  administrators  and  educators  prevent 
and  appropriately  deal  with  sexual  assault  in  K–12  settings.  We  have  also 
provided guidance to educators on ways to address harassment and discrimi-
nation  of  students  in  school  settings,  including  transgender  girls  and 
women—who  too  often  face  bullying  and  abuse  that  harm  their  education. 
The  Department  of  Justice  also  released  guidance  to  identify  and  prevent 
gender  bias  in  law  enforcement  responses  to  sexual  assault  and  domestic 
violence  cases.  And  because  84  percent  of  American  Indian  and  Alaska 
Native  women  and  girls  will  experience  some  form  of  violence  in  their 
lifetimes,  we  have  protected  the  ability  of  tribes  to  prosecute  non-Native 
perpetrators  of  domestic  violence  in  Indian  Country  through  provisions  in-
cluded  in  the  2013  reauthorization  of  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act. 
As  we  work  to  expand  opportunities  here  in  the  United  States,  we  must 
also  look  abroad  and  acknowledge  that  any  country  that  oppresses  half 
of  its  population—that  prevents  women  and  girls  from  going  to  school

or  work  or  refuses  to  give  them  control  over  their  bodies  or  safety  from 
gender-motivated  abuse—is  not  a  society  that  can  thrive.  The  ideologies 
that  harm  girls  and  prevent  them  from  fulfilling  their  potential  are  the 
same ideologies that have led countries to instability, violence, and terrorism. 
That  is  why  earlier  this  year,  we  launched  the  U.S.  Global  Strategy  to 
Empower  Adolescent  Girls—a  strategy  aimed  at  bringing  Federal  agencies 
together  to  comprehensively  improve  the  lives  of  girls  around  the  world, 
safeguard their rights, and encourage their full social, political, and economic 
participation.  To  specifically  focus  on  the  challenge  of  adolescent  girls’ 
education,  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  I  launched  the  Let  Girls  Learn 
initiative,  through  which  we  are  working  with  companies,  organizations, 
and  foreign  governments  to  help  give  adolescent  girls  around  the  world 
the  chance  to  go  to  school—because  a  world  in  which  all  girls  have  access 
to  an  education  is  a  safer,  fairer,  and  more  stable  place.  The  initiative 
includes  more  than  a  billion  dollars  for  funding  new  and  ongoing  program-
ming  in  more  than  50  countries  to  help  adolescent  girls  attend  and  stay 
in  school.  And  the  White  House  will  soon  host  the  first  meeting  of  the 
North  American  Working  Group  on  Violence  against  Indigenous  Women 
and  Girls  to  champion  regional  coordination  on  the  rights  of  women  and 
girls from indigenous communities across North America. 
Around  the  world—from  Africa  to  Southeast  Asia  to  Latin  America—we 
are  striving  to  improve  girls’  welfare,  build  their  skills,  and  promote  their 
participation  as  the  next  generation  of  leaders.  We  are  working  to  prevent 
and  respond  to  violence  against  women  and  girls  in  fragile  settings  as 
well  as  support  refugees  and  displaced  persons  around  the  world.  We  are 
undertaking  targeted  efforts  to  address  child,  early,  and  forced  marriage, 
and  we  are  investing  in  new  programs,  including  survivor-led  programs, 
to end female genital mutilation and cutting in seven countries across South-
east Asia and West Africa. In sub-Saharan Africa, we are helping adolescent 
girls  pay  for  and  attend  school,  while  ensuring  they  learn  about  HIV  and 
violence  prevention.  We  have  sponsored  ‘‘Women  in  Science’’  camps  in 
Peru  and  Rwanda  to  give  girls  abroad  the  opportunity  to  learn  how  to 
use  technology  to  improve  their  communities.  We  are  also  working  with 
Pakistan  to  advance  women’s  economic  participation  and  entrepreneurship 
and  launch  the  country’s  first  ‘‘Take  Your  Daughter  to  Work  Day.’’  And 
we  remain  committed  to  ending  human  trafficking  and  have  taken  unprece-
dented  steps  to  provide  comprehensive  services  to  victims,  bring  traffickers 
to  justice,  apply  new  technologies  to  combat  modern  slavery,  and  provide 
training and promote awareness at home and abroad. 
This  summer,  5,000  leaders  from  around  the  world  gathered  at  the  first 
ever  United  State  of  Women  Summit  to  highlight  the  work  we  have  done 
and  to  build  an  agenda  for  the  future.  But  we  know  there  is  still  more 
to  do,  and  I  have  made  advancing  gender  equality  a  foreign  policy  priority 
to  ensure  we  can  continue  removing  barriers  that  prevent  women  from 
reaching  their  full  potential.  More  than  our  policies,  we  must  commit  to 
changing  the  culture  that  raises  our  daughters  to  be  demure  or  criticizes 
them for speaking out—and to changing the attitude that permits the routine 
harassment  of  women  and  girls,  whether  walking  down  the  street  or  going 
online. We are working with communities and businesses that are rethinking 
workplace policies, funding women entrepreneurs, expanding female leader-
ship,  and  creating  more  opportunities  for  women  and  girls  who  too  often 
face disproportionate challenges—including women and girls of color, women 
and  girls  with  disabilities,  and  lesbian,  bisexual,  and  transgender  women 
and  girls—because  everyone  has  a  role  to  play  and  everybody  deserves 
the chance to pursue their dreams. 
This  is  the  future  we  are  forging:  Where  women  and  girls,  no  matter  what 
they look like or where they are from, can live free from the fear of violence. 
A  future  where  all  girls  know  they  can  hold  any  job,  run  any  company, 
and  compete  in  any  field.  Today,  we  recommit  ourselves  to  the  belief  that 
when  everyone  has  the  opportunity  to  go  to  school,  explore  their  passions, 
and  achieve  their  dreams,  our  communities  are  stronger,  more  resilient,

Proclamation  9430  of  April  27,  2016 

Workers  Memorial  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  story  of  America  is  the  story  of  its  workers.  With  faith  in  one  another 
and  hope  for  what  their  country  could  be,  generations  of  laborers  fought, 
sacrificed,  and  organized  for  the  rights  and  protections  that  workers  across 
our  Nation  have  today—including  requirements  to  protect  their  health  and 
safety.  Today,  we  honor  this  legacy  by  reflecting  on  those  who  have  lost 
their  lives  in  the  workplace,  and  we  reaffirm  our  dedication  to  ensuring 
that  people  can  work  knowing  the  fullest  measure  of  stability,  security, 
and opportunity. 
In 1969 and 1970, two pieces of legislation of enormous consequence forever 
changed  the  lives  of  workers  across  our  Nation.  Passed  by  a  Democratic 
Congress  and  signed  by  a  Republican  President,  the  Federal  Coal  Mine 
Health  and  Safety  Act—which  required  Federal  inspections  of  coal  mines, 
established  processes  and  protections  for  ensuring  the  health  and  safety 
of coal miners, and was later amended to cover all miners—and the Occupa-
tional Safety and Health Act—which created new standards for worker protec-
tions  in  industries  across  America—represented  milestone  achievements  for 
a  cause  borne  out  of  decades  of  toil  and  struggle.  Spurred  by  working 
men  and  women  of  every  origin  and  background,  the  movement  for  worker 
safety  was  inspired  by  a  simple  notion:  that  those  who  contribute  so  much 
to  the  economy  and  spirit  of  our  country  should  have  every  chance  to 
share in its promise. 
Since I took office, my Administration has advanced protections for America’s 
workers.  In  2014,  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  aimed  at  cracking  down 
on  Federal  contractors  who  violate  our  labor  laws,  and  in  the  time  since, 
we  have  enhanced  our  rigorous  processes  for  companies  contracting  with 
the  Federal  Government  while  working  to  enforce  and  raise  standards  for 
employers  throughout  our  economy.  We  have  implemented  rules  that  cut 
the  amount  of  coal  dust  inhaled  by  coal  miners,  and  we  have  taken  steps 
to  protect  more  workers  from  diseases  caused  by  exposure  to  silica  and 
other harmful substances. And we will enhance our efforts to support workers 
injured  on  the  job,  because  if  you  are  hurt  at  the  workplace  after  giving 
your all, you should still be able to keep food on the table. 
The history of America’s workers reminds us that, far from being inevitable, 
the  progress  each  generation  has  known  has  been  the  result  of  the  courage, 
determination, and solidarity demonstrated by the last. This Workers Memo-
rial  Day,  as  we  join  in  solemn  remembrance  of  those  who  lost  their  lives 
undertaking  their  labor,  let  us  carry  forward  the  vision  of  just  and  safe 
working  conditions  for  all  of  America’s  workers.  If  we  stay  true  to  that 
essential mission, we can deliver to our children and grandchildren a future 
of ever greater possibility and security. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  28,  2016, 
as  Workers  Memorial  Day.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  participate  in  cere-
monies  and  activities  in  memory  of  those  killed  or  injured  due  to  unsafe 
working conditions.

Proclamation  9484  of  September  1,  2016 

National  Ovarian  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Causing  more  deaths  than  any  other  female  reproductive  system  cancers, 
ovarian cancer affects women of all ages and backgrounds. But the incidence 
of  ovarian  cancer,  and  its  death  rate,  have  fallen  in  recent  years.  Today, 
cancer  research  is  on  the  cusp  of  major  breakthroughs,  and  it  is  of  critical 
national  importance  that  we  accelerate  this  progress  and  keep  reaching  for 
prevention,  treatment,  and  a  cure.  Each  September,  in  honor  of  the  women 
who  have  been  taken  by  ovarian  cancer  and  the  brave  individuals  still 
fighting  this  disease,  we  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  carrying  forward  this 
important work. 
It  is  estimated  that  more  than  22,000  American  women  will  be  diagnosed 
with  ovarian  cancer  this  year,  and  due  to  a  lack  of  effective  screening 
tests  and  early  warning  signs,  many  of  these  cases  will  be  caught  at  an 
advanced  stage—making  the  cancer  more  difficult  to  treat,  with  a  lower 
chance  for  recovery.  Ovarian  cancer  is  more  common  among  older  women 
and  those  who  have  it  in  their  family  history,  but  because  most  women 
are diagnosed without being at high risk, it is crucial that all women consult 
with  their  health  care  providers  when  experiencing  some  of  its  symptoms, 
which include pressure, swelling, and abdominal pain. I encourage everyone 
to visit www.Cancer.gov/Ovarian to learn more about the signs and symptoms 
of this disease. 
Under  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  annual  and  lifetime  limits  on  insurance 
coverage  have  been  eliminated,  and  critical  preventive  services  like  well- 
woman  visits—which  are  now  available  without  a  copay  or  deductible— 
have been expanded for millions more women. The Act also prohibits insur-
ance  companies  from  denying  coverage  based  on  a  pre-existing  condition, 
including cancer, or from denying coverage due to a family history of cancer. 
Earlier  this  year,  I  announced  a  new  national  effort  to  cure  cancer.  Led 
by  Vice  President  Joe  Biden,  the  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot  Task  Force 
is  promoting  research  efforts  and  breaking  down  barriers  to  progress  to 
eliminate cancer as we know it. With the help of a nearly $1 billion initiative 
to  jumpstart  this  work,  we  are  harnessing  the  spirit  of  American  innovation 
to  identify  new  ways  to  prevent,  diagnose,  and  treat  cancer.  The  Task 
Force  builds  on  the  important  work  that  Federal  agencies  have  already 
been doing throughout my time in office to fight ovarian cancer. The Depart-
ment of Defense Ovarian Cancer Research Program is supporting high-impact, 
cutting-edge  research  where  it  is  needed  most  and  has  helped  push  these 
research priorities forward. And the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-

signs and seek medical care. 
For  the  mothers,  sisters,  daughters,  partners,  and  families  who  face  the 
pain  and  heartache  of  ovarian  cancer,  we  must  make  America  the  country

Proclamation  9509  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Disability  Employment  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Americans  with  disabilities  are  entitled  to  the  same  rights  and  freedoms 
as any other citizen—including the right to dignity and respect in the work-
place.  Too  often  in  our  Nation’s  history,  individuals  with  disabilities  have 
been eager to work but could not find a job, facing red tape, discrimination, 
or  employers  who  assumed  that  disabled  meant  unable  and  refused  to  hire 
them.  This  month,  we  recognize  the  significant  progress  our  country  has 
made for those living with disabilities, and we honor the lasting contributions 
and diverse skills they bring to our workforce. 

As  a  country,  we  must  acknowledge  that  despite  the  great  strides  we  have 
made  in  the  26  years  since  the  passage  of  the  Americans  with  Disabilities 
Act—a  groundbreaking  civil  rights  law  aimed  at  eliminating  discrimination 
and  assuring  equality  for  people  with  disabilities—we  still  have  far  to  go 
to  raise  awareness  of  discriminatory  obstacles  that  individuals  with  disabil-
ities  encounter  in  employment.  Today,  the  labor  force  participation  rate 
for Americans with disabilities is less than one-third the rate of those without 
a  disability,  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  more  than  twice  as  high  for 
individuals  with  disabilities.  To  break  down  more  of  these  barriers,  we 
must  expand  access  to  the  resources  and  training  necessary  for  Americans 
with disabilities to succeed in the workplace. 

My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  upholding  our  Nation’s  promise  of  equal 
opportunity  for  all  and  advancing  employment  for  people  with  disabilities 
in  every  community.  I  am  proud  that  the  Federal  Government  is  leading 
by  example  as  a  model  employer,  now  employing  more  Americans  with 
disabilities  than  at  any  time  in  the  last  30  years.  Last  year,  the  White 
House  hosted  a  Summit  on  Disability  and  Employment  to  share  resources 
for  employers  to  hire  more  individuals  with  disabilities  and  effective  strate-
gies  for  recruitment,  retention,  hiring,  and  promotion  of  these  employees. 
Two  years  ago,  through  updates  to  Section  503  of  the  Rehabilitation  Act, 
we  took  action  to  increase  the  representation  of  workers  with  disabilities 
in the Federal contractor workforce. In 2014, I signed the Workforce Innova-
tion  and  Opportunity  Act  to  help  the  Departments  of  Labor  and  Education 
build initiatives that advance employment opportunities for individuals with 
disabilities—and  earlier  this  summer,  we  issued  new  regulations  to  provide 
greater  and  more  inclusive  career  development  and  training  opportunities 
for anyone facing barriers to employment. 

This year’s National Disability Employment Awareness Month theme focuses 
on the importance of inclusion, especially when it comes to business, oppor-
tunity, and innovation. When we diversify our workforce we create opportu-
nities  for  growth  and  improvement—not  just  for  those  with  disabilities, 
but  for  everyone.  This  month,  let  us  continue  striving  to  forge  a  future 
where workplaces are more inclusive and where employees are more accepted 
for  who  they  are.  And  because  we  know  that  our  country  does  best  when 
everyone  gets  their  fair  shot,  let  us  keep  working  to  ensure  no  one  is 
left behind or unable to pursue their dreams because of a disability.

Proclamation  9414  of  March  31,  2016 

National  Sexual  Assault  Awareness  and  Prevention  Month, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

At  our  country’s  core  is  a  basic  belief  in  the  inherent  dignity  of  every 
person.  Too  many  women  and  men  of  all  ages  suffer  the  outrage  that  is 
sexual  assault,  and  too  often,  this  crime  is  not  condemned  as  loudly  as 
it  should  be.  Together,  we  must  stand  up  and  speak  out  to  change  the 
culture  that  questions  the  actions  of  victims,  rather  than  those  of  their 
attackers.  As  their  relatives,  friends,  neighbors,  and  fellow  Americans,  it’s 
on  us  to  support  victims  and  survivors  by  providing  them  with  the  care 
they  need,  bringing  perpetrators  to  justice,  and  ensuring  our  institutions 
are held responsible and do not look the other way. This month, we reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  shift  the  attitudes  that  allow  sexual  assault  to  go  unan-
swered and unpunished, and we redouble our efforts to prevent this human 
rights violation from happening in the first place. 

Preventing sexual assault begins with everyone getting involved in promoting 
healthy  relationships  and  encouraging  respect  for  the  equality  of  others. 
For  decades,  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  has  brought  unmatched  passion  to 
this  cause,  working  to  pass  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act  in  the  Senate 
more  than  two  decades  ago,  and  continuing  to  fight  today  to  transform 
the  way  we  think  and  talk  about  sexual  assault.  In  2014,  we  launched 
the  ‘‘It’s  On  Us’’  campaign—an  initiative  that  has  worked  with  over  300 
college  campuses  and  engaged  hundreds  of  thousands  of  people  around 
our  country  who  have  taken  a  pledge  to  stand  up  and  speak  out  to  express 
moral  outrage  for  this  intolerable  crime.  We  launched  the  White  House 
Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault that year as well, which 
continues  to  offer  recommendations  for  how  we  can  all  contribute  to  a 
society that adequately prevents and responds to sexual assault. 

My  Administration  is  taking  action  to  eliminate  sexual  assault  in  every 
corner  of  our  country.  This  year,  we  announced  new  grants  available  for 
the  National  Sexual  Assault  Kit  Initiative,  a  nationwide,  community-based 
effort  to  end  the  backlog  of  untested  rape  kits—instrumental  tools  used 
to  collect  evidence,  prosecute  perpetrators,  and  bring  closure  to  victims 
in  the  aftermath  of  an  assault.  These  funds  are  supporting  efforts  to  ensure 
victims  are  notified  of  the  testing,  connected  to  support  services,  and  given 
the  option  of  participating  in  the  criminal  justice  process.  Additionally, 
we  have  offered  new  tools  and  resources  to  help  States  and  communities 
take  advantage  of  the  best  available  measures  to  prevent  sexual  violence. 
The  Department  of  Justice  issued  new  guidance  for  law  enforcement  on 
identifying  and  preventing  gender  bias  in  response  to  sexual  assault  and 
domestic  violence.  And  I  have  directed  military  leadership  to  prioritize 
this  issue  and  equip  our  men  and  women  in  uniform  with  the  knowledge 
and  tools  necessary  to  combat  sexual  violence.  From  our  military  to  our 
schools,  and  in  law  enforcement  agencies  in  communities  across  America, 
we  will  keep  working  to  address  sexual  violence  and  root  it  out  wherever 
it exists.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  65 / Tuesday,  April  5,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

Anyone  can  be  a  leader  in  the  fight  to  prevent  and  end  sexual  assault. 
As employers, educators, parents, and friends, all Americans have an obliga-
tion  to  uphold  the  basic  principle  that  every  individual  should  be  free 
from  violence  and  fear.  During  National  Sexual  Assault  Awareness  and 
Prevention Month, we recommit to embracing each of our individual respon-
sibilities  to  keep  our  communities  safe  from  this  crime  and  to  stand  with 
survivors and victims of sexual assault. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2016 as National 
Sexual  Assault  Awareness  and  Prevention  Month.  I  urge  all  Americans  to 
support survivors of sexual assault and work together to prevent these crimes 
in their communities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9491  of  September  9,  2016 

Patriot  Day  and  National  Day  of  Service  and  Remembrance, 
2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Fifteen  years  ago,  nearly  3,000  innocent  lives—men,  women,  and  children 
who had been going about their normal routines—were taken from us, depriv-
ing  families  and  loved  ones  of  a  lifetime  of  precious  moments.  But  the 
acts  of  terror  of  September  11,  2001,  sought  to  do  more  than  hurt  our 
people  and  bring  down  buildings:  They  sought  to  break  our  spirit  and 
destroy  the  enduring  values  that  unite  us  as  Americans.  In  the  years  that 
followed,  our  capacity  to  love  and  to  hope  has  guided  us  forward  as  we 
worked  to  rebuild,  more  sound  and  resilient  than  ever  before.  With  the 
hearts  of  those  we  lost  held  faithfully  in  our  memories,  we  reaffirm  the 
unwavering  optimism  and  everlasting  strength  that  brought  us  together  in 
our  darkest  hour,  and  we  resolve  to  give  of  ourselves  in  service  to  others 
in that same spirit. 
The  pain  inflicted  on  our  Nation  on  September  11  was  felt  by  people 
of  every  race,  background,  and  faith.  Though  many  young  Americans  have 
grown  up  without  knowing  firsthand  the  horrors  of  that  day,  their  lives 
have been shaped by it. They hear of the many acts of service that occurred— 
coworkers  who  led  others  to  safety,  passengers  who  stormed  a  cockpit, 
and  first  responders  who  charged  directly  into  the  fire.  Many  Americans 
did  everything  they  could  to  help  survivors,  from  volunteering  their  time 
to  donating  food,  clothing,  and  blood.  And  many  signed  up  to  don  our 
Nation’s  uniform  to  prove  to  the  world  that  no  act  of  terror  could  eclipse 
the strength or character of our country. 
United  by  a  common  creed,  a  commitment  to  lifting  up  our  neighbors, 
and  a  belief  that  we  are  stronger  when  we  stand  by  one  another,  we  must 
find  the  courage  to  carry  forward  the  legacy  of  those  who  stepped  up 
in  our  time  of  need.  By  devoting  ourselves  to  each  other  and  recognizing 
that we are a part of something bigger than ourselves—just as heroic patriots 
did  on  September  11—we  are  paying  tribute  to  their  sacrifices.  On  this 
National  Day  of  Service  and  Remembrance,  we  must  ensure  that  darkness 
is  no  match  for  the  light  we  shine  by  engaging  in  acts  of  service  and 
charity.  I  invite  all  Americans  to  observe  this  day  with  compassionate  and 
selfless  deeds  that  embody  the  values  that  define  our  people,  and  to  visit 
www.Serve.gov  to  find  opportunities  to  give  back  to  their  communities. 
America  endures  in  the  tenacity  of  our  survivors,  and  in  the  dedication 
of  those  who  keep  us  safe.  Today,  we  honor  all  who  lost  their  lives  in 
the  heartbreaking  attacks  of  September  11,  and  all  who  made  the  ultimate 
sacrifice  for  our  country  in  the  years  that  followed.  In  memory  of  these 
beautiful  souls,  we  vow  to  keep  moving  forward.  Let  us  have  confidence 
in  the  values  that  make  us  American,  the  liberties  that  make  us  a  beacon 
to  the  world,  and  the  unity  we  sustain  every  year  on  this  anniversary. 
Above  all,  let  us  stand  as  strong  as  ever  before  and  recognize  that  together, 
there is nothing we cannot overcome. 
By  a  joint  resolution  approved  December  18,  2001  (Public  Law  107–89), 
the  Congress  has  designated  September  11  of  each  year  as  ‘‘Patriot  Day,’’ 
and  by  Public  Law  111–13,  approved  April  21,  2009,  the  Congress  has

Proclamation  9650  of  September  29,  2017 

Child  Health  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Child  Health  Day,  we  commit  to  protecting  and  promoting  the  health 
and  well-being  of  our  Nation’s  young  people.  How  we  treat  our  young 
people is a fundamental test of who we are as a society. Today, we reaffirm 
that  all  children  deserve  to  grow  up  in  healthy,  safe,  and  loving  homes, 
with parents or guardians who nurture, inspire, and empower them to realize 
their full potential. 
As  a  father,  I  know  the  hope  and  joy  children  bring  to  our  lives.  They 
are  society’s  most  precious  treasures  and  our  most  vulnerable  population. 
We  all  share  the  moral  responsibility  to  protect  the  health  of  our  children, 
born and unborn, so they have the chance to achieve their potential. 
To  these  ends,  my  Fiscal  Year  2018  Budget  provides  a  $30  million  increase 
for  the  Maternal  and  Child  Health  Services  Block  Grant  program,  which 
enhances access to critical health services for 57 million women and children. 
In close partnership with States and communities, this program helps ensure 
mothers receive critical prenatal care and nutrition, provides aid for children 
with disabilities, and opens access to other vital health services. The program 
also  addresses  emerging  issues  that  painfully  affect  our  children,  such  as 
mental  health  disorders  and  our  Nation’s  devastating  opioid  epidemic.  The 
number  of  infants  born  physically  dependent  on  opioids  has  more  than 
quadrupled  over  the  past  decade.  In  addition,  during  the  past  2  years, 
many States have experienced dramatic increases in the number of children 
in  their  foster-care  systems,  as  parents  have  struggled  with  addiction  and 
its  terrible  consequences.  I  am  committed  to  aggressively  combating  the 
scourge  of  opioid  abuse,  so  that  children  do  not  bear  the  burden  of  its 
devastation. 
Together,  we  will  strive  to  create  an  environment  in  which  children  of 
all  of  ages  and  backgrounds  grow  up  healthy  and  secure,  so  they  may 
use their unique talents to improve their communities and our world. 
The  Congress,  by  a  joint  resolution  approved  May  18,  1928,  as  amended 
(36 U.S.C. 105), has called for the designation of the first Monday in October 
as Child Health Day and has requested that the President issue a proclamation 
in observance of this day. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  do  hereby  proclaim  Monday,  October 
2, 2017, as Child Health Day. I call upon families, child health professionals, 
faith-based  and  community  organizations,  and  governments  to  help  ensure 
that America’s children stay safe and healthy.

Proclamation  9596  of  April  28,  2017 

Jewish  American  Heritage  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

During  Jewish  American  Heritage  Month,  we  celebrate  our  Nation’s  strong 
American  Jewish  heritage,  rooted  in  the  ancient  faith  and  traditions  of  the 
Jewish  people.  The  small  band  of  Dutch  Jews  who  first  immigrated  in 
1654,  seeking  refuge  and  religious  liberty,  brought  with  them  their  families, 
their  religion,  and  their  cherished  customs,  which  they  have  passed  on 
from  generation  to  generation.  The  moral  and  ethical  code  of  the  Jewish 
people  is  inspired  by  their  spiritual  vocation  of  ‘‘tikkun  olam’’—the  charge 
to  repair  the  world.  Through  that  vocation,  the  Jewish  people  have  left 
an  indelible  mark  on  American  culture.  Today,  it  is  manifested  in  the 
towering success Jewish people have achieved in America through a unique 
synthesis of respect for heritage and love of country. 

Escaping  religious  persecution  and  ethnic  violence  and  seeking  political 
freedom  and  economic  opportunity,  American  Jews,  over  centuries,  have 
held  firm  in  the  belief  that  the  United  States  was  ‘‘Di  Goldene  Medina’’— 
the  Golden  Country.  Those  who  moved  here  built  houses  and  gardens, 
raised  families,  and  launched  businesses.  They  have  pursued  education  to 
advance  their  mission  to  make  the  world  a  better  place.  In  every  aspect 
of  the  country’s  cultural,  spiritual,  economic,  and  civic  life,  American  Jews 
have  stood  at  the  forefront  of  the  struggles  for  human  freedom,  equality, 
and  dignity,  helping  to  shine  a  light  of  hope  to  people  around  the  globe. 

The  achievements  of  American  Jews  are  felt  throughout  American  society 
and  culture,  in  every  field  and  in  every  profession.  American  Jews  have 
built  institutions  of  higher  learning,  hospitals,  and  manifold  cultural  and 
philanthropic organizations. American Jews have even brought us our greatest 
superheroes—Captain America, Superman, and Batman. American Jews have 
composed  some  of  our  defining  national  hymns  like  God  Bless  America, 
timeless  musicals  like  The  Sound  of  Music,  and  even  famous  Christmas 
songs. From Admiral Hyman G. Rickover to Albert Einstein, Richard Rodgers 
to  Irving  Berlin,  Jerry  Siegel  to  Bill  Finger,  Mel  Brooks  to  Don  Rickles, 
and Levi Strauss to Elie Wiesel, American Jews have transformed all aspects 
of American life and continue to enrich the American spirit. 

This  month,  I  celebrate  with  my  family—including  my  daughter,  Ivanka, 
my son-in-law, Jared, my grandchildren, and our extended family—the deep 
spiritual  connection  that  binds,  and  will  always  bind,  the  Jewish  people 
to  the  United  States  and  its  founding  principles.  We  recognize  the  faith 
and  optimism  exemplified  by  American  Jews  is  what  truly  makes  America 
‘‘The Golden Country,’’ and we express our Nation’s gratitude for this great, 
strong, prosperous, and loving people. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  2017  as  Jewish 
American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the heritage 
and  contributions  of  American  Jews  and  to  observe  this  month  with  appro-
priate programs, activities, and ceremonies.

Proclamation  9561  of  December  28,  2016 

National  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking  Prevention  Month, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our  Nation  wrestled  with  the  issue  of  slavery  in  a  way  that  nearly  tore 
us  apart—its  fundamental  notion  in  direct  contradiction  with  our  founding 
premise  that  we  are  all  created  equal.  The  courageous  individuals  who 
rejected  such  cruelty  helped  us  overcome  one  of  the  most  painful  chapters 
in  our  history  as  we  worked  to  realize  the  promise  of  equality  and  justice 
for  all.  But  today,  in  too  many  places  around  the  world—including  right 
here  in  the  United  States—the  injustice  of  modern  slavery  and  human  traf-
ficking  still  tears  at  our  social  fabric.  During  National  Slavery  and  Human 
Trafficking  Prevention  Month,  we  resolve  to  shine  a  light  on  every  dark 
corner where human trafficking still threatens the basic rights and freedoms 
of others. 
From  factories  and  brothels  to  farms  and  mines,  millions  of  men,  women, 
and  children  in  the  United  States  and  around  the  world  are  exploited 
for  their  bodies  and  their  labor.  Whether  through  violence,  deceit,  or  the 
promises  of  a  better  life,  some  of  the  most  vulnerable  populations  among 
us—including  migrants  and  refugees  fleeing  conflict  or  disaster,  homeless 
LGBT  youth,  Alaska  Native  and  American  Indian  women  and  girls,  and 
children  in  poverty—are  preyed  upon  by  human  traffickers.  In  order  to 
rid  the  world  of  modern  slavery  we  must  do  everything  in  our  power 
to combat these violations of human decency. 
The  United  States  has  pursued  efforts  to  address  these  crimes  and  lift 
up  individuals  who  have  suffered  unspeakable  abuse  at  the  hands  of  traf-
fickers.  Through  the  Interagency  Task  Force  to  Monitor  and  Combat  Traf-
ficking in Persons, we have joined with the private sector, faith communities, 
law  enforcement,  and  advocates  to  coordinate  efforts  to  prevent  trafficking 
and  protect  victims.  Focusing  on  an  agenda  that  prioritizes  victim  services, 
the  rule  of  law,  procurement  of  supplies,  and  increasing  public  awareness, 
the  Task  Force  has  strengthened  Federal  efforts  to  end  human  trafficking. 
In 2012, I issued an Executive Order to strengthen protections against human 
trafficking  in  Federal  contracting,  and  nearly  a  year  ago,  I  signed  legislation 
that  strengthened  our  ability  to  prevent  products  made  with  forced  labor, 
including child labor, from entering American markets. 
We  must  address  the  consequences  of  human  trafficking  and  work  to  tackle 
its  root  causes.  This  past  fiscal  year,  the  Department  of  Health  and  Human 
Services  and  the  Department  of  Justice  provided  more  than  $60  million 
to community-based organizations and task forces to assist human trafficking 
victims,  and  since  the  beginning  of  my  Administration,  we  have  nearly 
tripled  the  number  of  victims  connected  to  services.  The  Department  of 
Homeland Security has also taken steps to streamline immigration procedures 
for trafficking victims and ensure their regulations are consistent with existing 
law.  And  through  new  Victims  of  Crime  Act  regulations,  Federal  funds 
can  now  be  used  to  help  human  trafficking  victims  with  their  housing. 
Through  the  White  House  Council  on  Women  and  Girls,  we  have  worked 
to address the sexual abuse-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately affects 
those  especially  vulnerable  to  sex  trafficking—including  young  women  and

girls  of  color.  And  the  U.S.  Advisory  Council  on  Human  Trafficking—com-
prised of 11 human trafficking survivors of diverse backgrounds and experi-
ences—recently  released  its  first  set  of  recommendations  for  combating 
human trafficking while keeping survivor perspectives in mind. 
Every  action  we  take  at  home,  from  the  clothing  we  wear  to  the  food 
we  eat,  is  connected  to  what  happens  around  the  world.  As  a  Nation, 
we  have  worked  to  address  the  problem  of  forced  labor  in  our  supply 
chains,  and  as  individuals,  we  must  strive  to  be  conscientious  consumers. 
Working with our friends and allies, we have made this issue an international 
priority.  Just  this  year  we  used  multilateral  fora,  including  the  North  Amer-
ican  Leaders  Summit,  the  East  Asia  Summit,  and  the  United  Nations,  to 
raise  awareness  and  work  with  partners  around  the  globe.  In  addition  to 
urging  other  countries  to  develop  and  expand  their  anti-trafficking  laws 
and  services  for  victims,  we  are  also  stepping  up  our  foreign  assistance 
in  this  area.  Working  alongside  the  international  community,  we  have  seen 
significant  increases  in  trafficking  prosecutions  and  convictions,  and  we 
have made great strides in supporting victims. 
As  leaders  in  the  global  undertaking  to  end  the  exploitation  of  human 
beings  for  profit,  we  must  always  remember  that  our  freedom  is  bound 
to  the  freedom  of  others.  This  month,  let  us  find  inspiration  in  America’s 
progress  toward  justice,  opportunity,  and  prosperity  for  all  and  reaffirm 
our pledge to continue fighting for human rights around the world. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  2017  as 
National  Slavery  and  Human  Trafficking  Prevention  Month,  culminating 
in  the  annual  celebration  of  National  Freedom  Day  on  February  1.  I  call 
upon  businesses,  national  and  community  organizations,  families,  and  all 
Americans  to  recognize  the  vital  role  we  must  play  in  ending  all  forms 
of slavery and to observe this month with appropriate programs and activities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-eighth 
day  of  December,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of 
the  Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and 
forty-first.

Proclamation  9566  of  January  12,  2017 

Establishment  of  the  Freedom  Riders  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
An interracial group of ‘‘Freedom Riders’’ set out in May 1961 on a journey 
from Washington, DC, to New Orleans through the Deep South. In organizing 
the 1961 Freedom Rides, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) was building 
upon  earlier  efforts  of  other  civil  rights  organizations,  including  the  1947 
‘‘Journey  of  Reconciliation,’’  an  integrated  bus  ride  through  the  segregated 
Upper  South.  The  purpose  of  the  1961  Freedom  Rides  was  to  test  if  bus 
station  facilities  in  the  Deep  South  were  complying  with  U.S.  Supreme 
Court decisions. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) had reversed 
the infamous ‘‘separate but equal’’ doctrine in public education, and Morgan 
v.  Virginia  (1946)  and  Boynton  v.  Virginia  (1960)  had  struck  down  Virginia 
laws compelling segregation in interstate travel. 
These rulings were the result of successful litigation brought by the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which laid the ground-
work  for  direct  action  campaigns  by  civil  rights  organizations  like  CORE, 
the  Southern  Christian  Leadership  Conference,  and  the  Student  Nonviolent 
Coordinating  Committee  (SNCC).  These  organizations  had  gathered  strength, 
and  by  the  1950s  had  launched  mass  movements  that  demonstrated  the 
power  of  nonviolent  protest.  At  the  same  time,  reaction  to  the  decision 
in Brown v. Board of Education had heightened racial tensions in the country, 
especially  in  the  Deep  South.  White  Citizens’  Councils,  made  up  of  politi-
cians,  businessmen,  and  civic  leaders  committed  to  resisting  integration, 
formed throughout the South. In 1956, over 100 members of Congress signed 
the  ‘‘Southern  Manifesto,’’  which  criticized  the  Brown  decision  and  called 
for  resistance  to  its  implementation.  This  campaign  of  massive  resistance 
launched  by  white  segregationists  reinforced  their  determination  to  assure 
continued separation of the races in public spaces. 
Against this background, on May 4, 1961, in Washington, DC, eleven Freedom 
Riders  split  into  two  groups  and  boarded  two  buses,  a  Greyhound  bus 
and  a  Trailways  bus,  bound  for  New  Orleans.  The  Greyhound  bus  carrying 
the  first  of  these  groups  left  Atlanta,  Georgia  on  Sunday,  May  14,  and 
pulled  into  a  Greyhound  bus  station  in  Anniston,  Alabama  later  that  day. 
There,  a  segregationist  mob,  including  members  of  the  Ku  Klux  Klan,  vio-
lently  attacked  the  Freedom  Riders.  The  attackers  threw  rocks  at  the  bus, 
broke  windows,  and  slashed  tires.  Belatedly,  police  officers  arrived  and 
cleared  a  path,  allowing  the  bus  to  depart  with  a  long  line  of  vehicles 
in  pursuit.  Two  cars  pulled  ahead  of  the  bus  and  forced  the  bus  to  slow 
to  a  crawl.  Six  miles  outside  of  town,  the  bus’s  slashed  tires  gave  out 
and  the  driver  stopped  on  the  shoulder  of  Highway  202.  There,  with  the 
Freedom  Riders  onboard,  one  member  of  the  mob  threw  a  flaming  bundle 
of  rags  through  one  of  the  windows  that  caused  an  explosion  seconds 
later.  The  Freedom  Riders  struggled  to  escape  as  members  of  the  mob  at-
tempted  to  trap  them  inside  the  burning  bus.  When  they  finally  broke 
free,  they  received  little  aid  for  their  injuries.  Later  that  day,  deacons  dis-
patched  by  Reverend  Fred  L.  Shuttlesworth  of  Birmingham’s  Bethel  Baptist 
Church  rescued  the  Freedom  Riders  from  the  hostile  mob  at  Anniston  Hos-
pital  and  drove  them  to  Birmingham  for  shelter  at  the  church.  A  freelance 
photojournalist  captured  the  horrific  scene  of  the  attack  in  photographs,

which  appeared  on  the  front  pages  of  newspapers  across  America  the  next 
day.  The  brutal  portrayal  of  segregation  in  the  South  shocked  many  Ameri-
cans  and  forced  the  issue  of  racial  segregation  in  interstate  travel  to  the 
forefront of the American conscience. 
When  the  Trailways  bus,  which  had  departed  Atlanta  an  hour  after  the 
Greyhound bus, arrived in Anniston, the Trailways station was mostly quiet. 
A  group  of  Klansmen  boarded  the  bus  and  forcibly  segregated  the  Freedom 
Riders.  With  all  aboard,  the  bus  left  on  its  two-hour  trip  to  Birmingham 
during which the Klansmen continued to intimidate and harass the Freedom 
Riders.  When  the  Trailways  bus  arrived  in  Birmingham,  a  mob  of  white 
men  and  women  attacked  the  Freedom  Riders,  reporters,  and  bystanders 
with  fists,  iron  pipes,  baseball  bats,  and  other  weapons,  while  the  police 
department  under  the  charge  of  Commissioner  of  Public  Safety  T.  Eugene 
‘‘Bull’’  Connor  was  nowhere  to  be  seen.  After  fifteen  minutes  of  violence, 
the mob retreated and the police appeared. 
Leaders  of  the  Nashville  Student  Movement,  including  members  of  SNCC, 
firmly  believed  that  they  could  not  let  violence  prevail  over  nonviolence. 
They  organized  an  interracial  group  of  volunteers  to  travel  to  Birmingham 
and  resume  the  Freedom  Rides.  Under  police  protection  negotiated  with 
help  from  the  Kennedy  Administration,  on  May  20,  these  SNCC  Freedom 
Riders  departed  Birmingham  en  route  to  Montgomery,  Alabama,  where  an 
angry white mob viciously attacked them. The next night, Dr. Martin Luther 
King,  Jr.—who  had  not  been  involved  in  the  planning  of  the  Freedom 
Rides—joined Reverend Ralph David Abernathy and Reverend Shuttlesworth 
at  a  mass  meeting  in  Abernathy’s  First  Baptist  Church  in  Montgomery. 
A white mob gathered outside the church, attacked African American onlook-
ers,  and  held  hostage  the  civil  rights  leaders  and  approximately  1,500 
attendees  inside  the  church.  King  remained  in  telephone  communication 
with  Attorney  General  Robert  F.  Kennedy  while  U.S.  marshals  attempted 
to  repel  the  siege.  Finally,  Governor  John  Patterson  was  forced  to  declare 
martial law and send in the National Guard. 
Media  coverage  of  the  Freedom  Rides  inspired  many  people  to  take  action 
and  join  the  effort  to  end  racial  inequality.  Over  the  summer  of  1961, 
the  number  of  Freedom  Riders  grew  to  over  400,  many  of  whom  were 
arrested  and  jailed  for  their  activism.  The  Freedom  Rides  of  1961  focused 
national  attention  on  Southern  segregationists’  disregard  for  U.S.  Supreme 
Court  rulings  and  the  violence  that  they  used  to  enforce  unconstitutional 
State  and  local  segregation  laws  and  practices.  The  Freedom  Rides  forced 
the  Federal  Government  to  take  steps  to  ban  segregation  in  interstate  bus 
travel. On May 29, 1961, Attorney General Kennedy petitioned the Interstate 
Commerce  Commission  (ICC)  to  issue  regulations  banning  segregation,  and 
the  ICC  subsequently  decreed  that  by  November  1,  1961,  bus  carriers  and 
terminals serving interstate travel had to be integrated. 
As  described  above,  the  sites  of  these  events  contain  objects  of  historic 
interest from a critical period of American history. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS,  the  City  of  Anniston  has  donated  to  The  Conservation  Fund 
fee title to the former Greyhound bus station building in downtown Anniston, 
Alabama, approximately 0.17 acres of land; 
WHEREAS,  Calhoun  County  has  donated  to  The  Conservation  Fund  fee 
title to the site of the bus burning outside Anniston, Alabama, approximately 
5.79 acres of land;

WHEREAS,  The  Conservation  Fund  has  relinquished  and  conveyed  all  of 
these lands to the United States of America; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  the  historic 
objects  associated  with  the  former  Greyhound  bus  station  in  Anniston,  Ala-
bama,  and  the  site  of  the  bus  burning  outside  Anniston  in  Calhoun  County, 
Alabama; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  section  320301  of  title  54, 
United  States  Code,  hereby  proclaim  the  objects  identified  above  that  are 
situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal  Government  to  be  the  Freedom  Riders  National  Monument  (monu-
ment)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  a  part 
thereof  all  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Federal 
Government  within  the  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map, 
which  is  attached  to  and  forms  a  part  of  this  proclamation.  The  reserved 
Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  encompass  approximately  5.96  acres. 
The  boundaries  described  on  the  accompanying  map  are  confined  to  the 
smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects 
to be protected. 
All  Federal  lands  and  interests  in  lands  within  the  boundaries  described 
on  the  accompanying  map  are  hereby  appropriated  and  withdrawn  from 
all  forms  of  entry,  location,  selection,  sale,  or  other  disposition  under  the 
public  land  laws,  from  location,  entry,  and  patent  under  the  mining  laws, 
and  from  disposition  under  all  laws  relating  to  mineral  and  geothermal 
leasing. 
The  establishment  of  the  monument  is  subject  to  valid  existing  rights.  If 
the  Federal  Government  acquires  any  lands  or  interests  in  lands  not  owned 
or  controlled  by  the  Federal  Government  within  the  boundaries  described 
on the accompanying map, such lands and interests in lands shall be reserved 
as  a  part  of  the  monument,  and  objects  identified  above  that  are  situated 
upon  those  lands  and  interests  in  lands  shall  be  part  of  the  monument, 
upon acquisition of ownership or control by the Federal Government. 
The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) shall manage the monument through 
the National Park Service, pursuant to applicable legal authorities, consistent 
with  the  purposes  and  provisions  of  this  proclamation.  The  Secretary  shall 
use available authorities, as appropriate, to enter into agreements with others 
to  address  common  interests  and  promote  management  needs  and  effi-
ciencies. 
The Secretary shall prepare a management plan, with full public involvement, 
within  3  years  of  the  date  of  this  proclamation.  The  management  plan 
shall ensure that the monument fulfills the following purposes for the benefit 
of  present  and  future  generations:  (1)  to  preserve  and  protect  the  objects 
of  historic  interest  associated  with  the  monument,  and  (2)  to  interpret  the 
objects,  resources,  and  values  related  to  the  civil  rights  movement.  The 
management plan shall, among other things, set forth the desired relationship 
of  the  monument  to  other  related  resources,  programs,  and  organizations, 
both within and outside the National Park System. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation. 
Warning  is  hereby  given  to  all  unauthorized  persons  not  to  appropriate, 
injure,  destroy,  or  remove  any  feature  of  this  monument  and  not  to  locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Presidential Documents

21909 

Notice  of  May  9,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  the 
Actions  of  the  Government  of  Syria 

On  May  11,  2004,  pursuant  to  his  authority  under  the  International  Emer-
gency  Economic  Powers  Act,  50  U.S.C.  1701–1706,  and  the  Syria  Account-
ability  and  Lebanese  Sovereignty  Restoration  Act  of  2003,  Public  Law  108– 
175,  the  President  issued  Executive  Order  13338,  in  which  he  declared 
a  national  emergency  with  respect  to  the  actions  of  the  Government  of 
Syria.  To  deal  with  this  national  emergency,  Executive  Order  13338  author-
ized  the  blocking  of  property  of  certain  persons  and  prohibited  the  expor-
tation  or  reexportation  of  certain  goods  to  Syria.  The  national  emergency 
was modified in scope and relied upon for additional steps taken in Executive 
Order  13399  of  April  25,  2006,  Executive  Order  13460  of  February  13, 
2008,  Executive  Order  13572  of  April  29,  2011,  Executive  Order  13573 
of  May  18,  2011,  Executive  Order  13582  of  August  17,  2011,  Executive 
Order  13606  of  April  22,  2012,  and  Executive  Order  13608  of  May  1,  2012. 

The President took these actions to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United 
States  constituted  by  the  actions  of  the  Government  of  Syria  in  supporting 
terrorism,  maintaining  its  then-existing  occupation  of  Lebanon,  pursuing 
weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining United 
States  and  international  efforts  with  respect  to  the  stabilization  and  recon-
struction of Iraq. 

The  regime’s  brutality  and  repression  of  the  Syrian  people,  who  have  been 
calling  for  freedom  and  a  representative  government,  not  only  endangers 
the  Syrian  people  themselves,  but  also  generates  instability  throughout  the 
region.  The  Syrian  regime’s  actions  and  policies,  including  with  respect 
to  chemical  and  biological  weapons,  supporting  terrorist  organizations,  and 
obstructing  the  Lebanese  government’s  ability  to  function  effectively,  con-
tinue  to  foster  the  rise  of  extremism  and  sectarianism  and  pose  an  unusual 
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy 
of  the  United  States.  As  a  result,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  May 
11,  2004,  and  the  measures  to  deal  with  that  emergency  adopted  on  that 
date in Executive Order 13338; on April 25, 2006, in Executive Order 13399; 
on  February  13,  2008,  in  Executive  Order  13460;  on  April  29,  2011,  in 
Executive  Order  13572;  on  May  18,  2011,  in  Executive  Order  13573;  on 
August 17, 2011, in Executive Order 13582; on April 22, 2012, in Executive 
Order 13606; and on May 1, 2012, in Executive Order 13608, must continue 
in effect beyond May 11, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) 
of  the  National  Emergencies  Act,  50  U.S.C.  1622(d),  I  am  continuing  for 
1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  with  respect  to  the  actions  of  the 
Government of Syria. 

In  addition,  the  United  States  condemns  the  Assad  regime’s  use  of  brutal 
violence  and  human  rights  abuses  and  calls  on  the  Assad  regime  to  stop 
its  violence  against  the  Syrian  people,  uphold  the  Cessation  of  Hostilities, 
enable  the  delivery  of  humanitarian  assistance,  and  allow  a  political  transi-
tion  in  Syria  that  will  forge  a  credible  path  to  a  future  of  greater  freedom, 
democracy, opportunity, and justice.

Executive  Order  13774  of  February  9,  2017 

Preventing  Violence  Against  Federal,  State,  Tribal,  and  Local 
Law  Enforcement  Officers 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section 1. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to: 

(a)  enforce  all  Federal  laws  in  order  to  enhance  the  protection  and  safety 
of  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law  enforcement  officers,  and  thereby 
all Americans; 

(b) develop strategies, in a process led by the Department of Justice (Depart-
ment)  and  within  the  boundaries  of  the  Constitution  and  existing  Federal 
laws,  to  further  enhance  the  protection  and  safety  of  Federal,  State,  tribal, 
and local law enforcement officers; and 

(c) pursue appropriate legislation, consistent with the Constitution’s regime 
of  limited  and  enumerated  Federal  powers,  that  will  define  new  Federal 
crimes, and increase penalties for existing Federal crimes, in order to prevent 
violence  against  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law  enforcement  officers. 
Sec.  2.  Implementation.  In  furtherance  of  the  policy  set  forth  in  section 
1 of this order, the Attorney General shall: 

(a)  develop  a  strategy  for  the  Department’s  use  of  existing  Federal  laws 
to prosecute individuals who commit or attempt to commit crimes of violence 
against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers; 

(b)  coordinate  with  State,  tribal,  and  local  governments,  and  with  law 
enforcement agencies at all levels, including other Federal agencies, in pros-
ecuting crimes of violence against Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforce-
ment  officers  in  order  to  advance  adequate  multi-jurisdiction  prosecution 
efforts; 

(c)  review  existing  Federal  laws  to  determine  whether  those  laws  are 
adequate  to  address  the  protection  and  safety  of  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and 
local law enforcement officers; 

(d) following that review, and in coordination with other Federal agencies, 
as  appropriate,  make  recommendations  to  the  President  for  legislation  to 
address  the  protection  and  safety  of  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law 
enforcement officers, including, if warranted, legislation defining new crimes 
of violence and establishing new mandatory minimum sentences for existing 
crimes  of  violence  against  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law  enforcement 
officers, as well as for related crimes; 

(e) coordinate with other Federal agencies to develop an executive branch 
strategy  to  prevent  violence  against  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law 
enforcement officers; 

(f)  thoroughly  evaluate  all  grant  funding  programs  currently  administered 
by the Department to determine the extent to which its grant funding supports 
and  protects  Federal,  State,  tribal,  and  local  law  enforcement  officers;  and 
(g)  recommend  to  the  President  any  changes  to  grant  funding,  based  on 
the  evaluation  required  by  subsection  (f)  of  this  section,  including  rec-
ommendations  for  legislation,  as  appropriate,  to  adequately  support  and 
protect Federal, State, tribal, and local law enforcement officers. 
Sec.  3.  General  Provisions.  (a)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed 
to impair or otherwise affect:

The  President 

Presidential Documents

20819 

Executive  Order  13796  of  April  29,  2017 

Addressing  Trade  Agreement  Violations  and  Abuses 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Every  trade  agreement  and  investment  agreement  entered 
into  by  the  United  States,  and  all  trade  relations  and  trade  preference  pro-
grams of the United States, should enhance our economic growth, contribute 
favorably to our balance of trade, and strengthen the American manufacturing 
base.  Many  United  States  free  trade  agreements,  investment  agreements, 
and  trade  relations  have  failed,  in  whole  or  in  part,  to  meet  these  criteria. 
The  result  has  been  large  and  persistent  trade  deficits,  a  lack  of  reciprocal 
treatment  of  American  goods  and  investment,  the  offshoring  of  factories 
and jobs, the loss of American intellectual property and reduced technological 
innovation, downward pressure on wage and income growth, and an impaired 
tax  base.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  negotiate  new  trade  agree-
ments,  investment  agreements,  and  trade  relations  that  benefit  American 
workers  and  domestic  manufacturers,  farmers,  and  ranchers;  protect  our 
intellectual  property;  and  encourage  domestic  research  and  development. 
It  is  also  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  renegotiate  or  terminate  any 
existing  trade  agreement,  investment  agreement,  or  trade  relation  that,  on 
net,  harms  the  United  States  economy,  United  States  businesses,  United 
States  intellectual  property  rights  and  innovation  rate,  or  the  American 
people. 
Sec.  2.  Conduct  Performance  Reviews.  The  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  the 
United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consultation with the Secretary 
of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Director 
of  the  Office  of  Trade  and  Manufacturing  Policy,  shall  conduct  comprehen-
sive performance reviews of: 

(a)  all  bilateral,  plurilateral,  and  multilateral  trade  agreements  and  invest-

ment agreements to which the United States is a party; and 

(b)  all  trade  relations  with  countries  governed  by  the  rules  of  the  World 
Trade  Organization  (WTO)  with  which  the  United  States  does  not  have 
free  trade  agreements  but  with  which  the  United  States  runs  significant 
trade deficits in goods. 
Sec.  3.  Report  of  Violations  and  Abuses.  (a)  Each  performance  review  shall 
be  submitted  to  the  President  by  the  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  the  USTR 
within 180 days of the date of this order and shall identify: 

(i) those violations or abuses of any United States trade agreement, invest-
ment  agreement,  WTO  rule  governing  any  trade  relation  under  the  WTO, 
or trade preference program that are harming American workers or domestic 
manufacturers,  farmers,  or  ranchers;  harming  our  intellectual  property 
rights;  reducing  our  rate  of  innovation;  or  impairing  domestic  research 
and development; 
(ii)  unfair  treatment  by  trade  and  investment  partners  that  is  harming 
American  workers  or  domestic  manufacturers,  farmers,  or  ranchers;  harm-
ing  our  intellectual  property  rights;  reducing  our  rate  of  innovation;  or 
impairing domestic research and development; 
(iii)  instances  where  a  trade  agreement,  investment  agreement,  trade  rela-
tion,  or  trade  preference  program  has  failed  with  regard  to  such  factors 
as  predicted  new  jobs  created,  favorable  effects  on  the  trade  balance,

Proclamation  9583  of  March  31,  2017 

National  Donate  Life  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  day,  Americans  sustain  the  miracle  of  life  by  generously  donating 
their  organs  and  tissue  to  others  in  need.  During  National  Donate  Life 
Month,  we  honor  the  living  and  deceased  donors  who  gave  so  others  could 
live, and celebrate the remarkable achievements of our healthcare and science 
professionals  who  perform  transplants  and  create  techniques  to  make  the 
gift of life possible. 
We  also  continue  our  efforts  to  raise  awareness  of  the  life-saving  potential 
Americans  have  as  donors.  The  Organ  Procurement  and  Transplantation 
Network reports that 33,606 transplants were performed during 2016, which 
is an 8.5 percent increase from 2015. 
Still,  additional  donors  are  urgently  needed.  More  than  118,000  people 
are  currently  waiting  for  organ  transplants,  and  thousands  of  our  family 
members  and  friends  die  each  year  waiting  for  matches.  This  month  we 
remind  Americans  that  people  of  all  ages  and  from  all  walks  of  life  can 
help  save  lives.  Remarkably,  one  organ  donor  can  save  up  to  eight  lives. 
One tissue donor can help 75 people heal. I encourage Americans everywhere 
to  learn  about  how  they  can  participate  in  the  gift  of  life  by  becoming 
organ  and  tissue  donors,  and  the  many  other  ways  they  can  give  to  those 
in need. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National 
Donate  Life  Month.  I  call  upon  healthcare  professionals,  volunteers,  edu-
cators, government agencies, faith-based and community groups, and private 
organizations  to  help  raise  awareness  of  the  urgent  need  for  organ  and 
tissue donors throughout our Nation.

Proclamation  9621  of  May  31,  2017 

National  Homeownership  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Homeownership  Month,  we  recognize  the  many  benefits 
of  homeownership  to  our  families,  our  communities,  and  our  Nation.  For 
generations  of  Americans,  owning  a  home  has  been  an  essential  element 
in  achieving  the  American  Dream.  Homeownership  is  often  the  foundation 
of  security  and  prosperity  for  families  and  communities  and  an  enduring 
symbol  of  American  freedom.  This  month,  we  recommit  to  ensuring  that 
hard-working Americans enjoy a fair chance at becoming homeowners. 
In  the  years  since  the  Great  Recession,  homeownership  rates  have  dipped 
to  historic  lows.  Many  Americans  are  not  confident  they  will  ever  own 
a home, a tragic consequence of a decade of weak economic growth, excessive 
regulations,  and  stagnant  wages.  Many  young  families  are  unable  to  achieve 
the  independence  they  desire  because  they  have  difficulty  saving  for  a 
down payment, overcoming regulatory burdens, or gaining access to adequate 
credit.  These  challenges  are  even  more  pronounced  for  minorities,  whose 
homeownership rates remain substantially below those of their fellow Ameri-
cans. 
I  am  committed  to  helping  hard-working  Americans  become  homeowners. 
As  part  of  my  Administration’s  plan  to  strengthen  the  middle  class  and 
the  American  housing  market,  I  am  working  with  the  Congress  on  a  pro- 
growth  agenda  of  reducing  rules  and  regulations,  cutting  taxes,  and  elimi-
nating unnecessary government spending. These policies will unshackle our 
economy  and  create  and  sustain  high-paying  jobs  so  that  more  Americans 
have the resources and freedom they deserve to fulfill their American Dream. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2017 as National 
Homeownership Month.

Proclamation  9613  of  May  19,  2017 

National  Safe  Boating  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As Memorial Day approaches and our summer season arrives, it is important 
for Americans of all ages to learn about safety on the water. During National 
Safe  Boating  Week,  the  U.S.  Coast  Guard  and  its  Federal,  State,  and  local 
safe  boating  partners  encourage  all  boaters  to  explore  and  enjoy  America’s 
beautiful waters responsibly. 
Safe boating begins with preparation. The Coast Guard estimates that human 
error  accounts  for  70  percent  of  all  boating  accidents  and  that  life  jackets 
could  prevent  more  than  80  percent  of  boating  fatalities.  Through  basic 
boating  safety  procedures—carrying  lifesaving  emergency  distress  and  com-
munications  equipment,  wearing  life  jackets,  attending  safe  boating  courses, 
participating in free boat safety checks, and staying sober when navigating— 
we can help ensure boaters on America’s coastal, inland, and offshore waters 
stay safe throughout the season. 
America’s diverse waterways are waiting to be explored. But before enjoying 
a  day  on  the  water,  Americans  should  take  time  this  week  to  familiarize 
themselves  with  safe  boating  practices  so  that  everyone  makes  it  home 
unharmed. 
In  recognition  of  the  importance  of  safe  boating  practices,  the  Congress, 
by  joint  resolution  approved  June  4,  1958  (36  U.S.C.  131),  as  amended, 
has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to  proclaim  annually  the  7- 
day period before Memorial Day weekend as ‘‘National Safe Boating Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  21  through  May  27,  2017,  as  National 
Safe  Boating  Week.  I  encourage  all  Americans  who  participate  in  boating 
activities  to  observe  this  occasion  by  learning  more  about  safe  boating  prac-
tices  and  taking  advantage  of  boating  safety  education  opportunities.  I  also 
encourage  the  Governors  of  the  States  and  Territories,  and  appropriate  offi-
cials  of  all  units  of  government,  to  join  me  in  encouraging  boating  safety 
through events and activities.

Proclamation  9655  of  October  6,  2017 

National  Manufacturing  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
America’s  manufacturers  have  laid  the  foundation  for  our  Nation’s  vibrant 
economy  and  have  secured  our  reputation  as  an  economic  superpower. 
Our  manufacturing  products  consistently  set  the  global  standard  for  design 
and quality. American manufacturing has been enduringly successful because 
it is the potent combination of the two great pillars of the American economy: 
the  American  entrepreneur  and  the  American  worker.  The  American  entre-
preneur  is  renowned  throughout  the  world  for  a  steadfast  determination 
to  deliver  value  and  innovation  to  the  global  marketplace.  The  American 
worker  has  consistently  demonstrated  the  unique  and  precious  ability  to 
harness  unmatched  work  ethic  and  ingenuity  and  turn  visions  and  dreams 
into  reality.  On  National  Manufacturing  Day,  we  celebrate  the  American 
manufacturers  and  their  workers  who  drive  our  economy,  strengthen  our 
national  security,  and  give  meaning  to  the  famous  phrase,  ‘‘Made  in  the 
USA.’’ We also highlight the many new and exciting opportunities for future 
generations to create the next wave of world-class American products. 
Today’s American manufacturers are consistently finding new ways to incor-
porate  advanced  technology  into  the  traditional  assembly  line  to  produce 
previously  unfathomable  breakthroughs  in  areas  like  aerospace,  medicine, 
and computers. These manufacturers are writing their chapter into the story 
of  American  innovation,  while  providing  countless  job  opportunities  to  ma-
chinists,  designers,  computer  programmers,  and  engineers,  among  others. 
In 2016, manufacturing contributed more than 11 percent to our gross domes-
tic  product  and  employed  more  than  12  million  workers.  The  American 
manufacturers  of  the  21st  century  employ  innovative  minds  equipped  with 
problem-solving  skills  and  knowledge  steeped  in  science,  technology,  engi-
neering, and mathematics, to build their incredible products. It is no surprise, 
then,  that  manufacturing  workers  earn  higher  annual  salaries,  on  average, 
than similar workers employed in other sectors. 
For too long, we have taken manufacturing, which represents the pioneering, 
hard-working  American  spirit,  for  granted.  Due  to  government  neglect  and 
inaction  we  have  witnessed  our  Nation’s  manufacturers  move  their  jobs 
and  innovation  overseas.  Remarkably,  we  have  stood  by  as  our  outdated 
tax  system  has  required  job-creators  to  put  their  money  toward  tax  prepara-
tion  and  a  bloated  government,  rather  than  into  new  jobs  and  innovations. 
It  has  also  trapped  earnings  that  could  be  invested  in  America,  and  instead 
encouraged corporations to invest overseas. Our business tax rate is currently 
60 percent higher than that of our average foreign competitor in the developed 
world.  By  contrast,  my  tax  plan  would  lower  the  tax  rate  for  businesses, 
so  they  can  stay  and  do  business  here  and  bring  back  profits  invested 
abroad.  Careless  and  unfair  trade  deals  are  also  at  fault  for  the  diminished 
state of American manufacturing today. These deals have severely disadvan-
taged American exports. My Administration, however, will right these wrongs 
and  ensure  a  level  playing  field  for  American  manufacturing  going  forward. 
Our  manufacturers  and  workers  deserve  no  less.  American  drive,  ingenuity, 
and  innovation  will  ultimately  win,  and  our  great  manufacturing  sector 
will thrive once again.

Proclamation  9642  of  September  15,  2017 

National  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities  Week, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As we celebrate Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, we recog-
nize  the  extraordinary  contributions  that  Historically  Black  Colleges  and 
Universities  (HBCUs)  have  made,  and  continue  to  make,  to  the  general 
welfare  and  prosperity  of  our  country.  Established  by  visionary  leaders, 
America’s  HBCUs  have  long  played  an  integral  role  in  our  Nation’s  history, 
providing Black Americans opportunities to learn and achieve their dreams. 
Many  HBCUs  were  founded  under  the  cold  shadow  of  segregation  and 
racial  prejudice.  Before  the  Civil  War,  most  institutions  of  higher  learning 
denied  admittance  to  minority  students.  HBCUs  formed  to  overcome  such 
discrimination  and  prove  to  the  Nation  that  all  students  deserve  a  high- 
quality  education,  and  that  all  Americans  can  rise  to  great  heights  if  given 
the  opportunity.  For  more  than  150  years,  HBCUs  have  produced  some 
of our Nation’s leaders in business, government, academia, and the military, 
and  they  have  helped  create  a  thriving  and  important  Black  middle  class. 
Today,  they  continue  to  provide  a  rigorous  education  to  students,  who 
are  often  from  low-income  backgrounds,  who  seek  to  advance  themselves 
and  give  back  to  their  Nation.  We  can  see  the  influences  of  HBCUs  in 
every  sector  of  our  economy,  from  medicine  and  law,  to  sports  and  jour-
nalism. 
Today,  more  than  100  HBCUs  are  thriving  in  19  States,  the  District  of 
Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, enrolling more than 300,000 students. 
This  year,  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities  Week  coincides  with 
the  150th  anniversary  of  nine  HBCUs:  Alabama  State  University,  Barber- 
Scotia  College,  Fayetteville  State  University,  Howard  University,  Johnson 
C.  Smith  University,  Morehouse  College,  Morgan  State  University,  St. 
Augustine’s  University,  and  Talladega  College.  It  is  a  great  honor  for  our 
Nation  to  join  in  celebrating  the  achievements  of  these  nine  institutions, 
as well as those of every HBCU across the country. 
Investing  in  HBCUs  strengthens  America’s  future,  and  my  Administration 
will  help  ensure  that  HBCUs  continue  to  be  self-sustainable  and  viable 
institutions  of  higher  education  for  generations  to  come.  This  week,  we 
will also host the Annual White House Historically Black College and Univer-
sities  Summit  to  provide  a  forum  for  HBCU  presidents,  faculty  members, 
students,  government  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  to  address  the  prior-
ities  set  forth  in  my  Executive  Order  to  Promote  Excellence  and  Innovation 
at  Historically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities,  signed  February  28,  2017. 
This  annual  summit  also  serves  to  honor  HBCU  All-Star  Students,  who 
are  appointed  for  1  year  to  serve  as  ambassadors  for  the  White  House 
Initiative on Historically Black College and Universities. 
National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week serves to remind 
us  of  the  historic  and  ongoing  struggle  for  equal  access  that  led  to  the 
establishment  of  HBCUs  in  our  Nation.  We  use  this  week  to  recognize 
the importance of HBCUs in educating the leaders of tomorrow, and reaffirm 
our  commitment  to  providing  every  student  with  the  opportunity  to  learn, 
grow, and find success no matter his or her background.

Proclamation  9420  of  April  8,  2016 

Pan  American  Day  and  Pan  American  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
A  decade  before  the  turn  of  the  19th  century,  representatives  of  countries 
from across the Western Hemisphere formed what would become the Organi-
zation  of  American  States,  striving  to  ensure  peace  and  democracy  through 
unity  and  cooperation  among  our  nations.  As  we  mark  126  years  since 
its  founding,  we  also  celebrate  the  15th  anniversary  of  the  Inter-American 
Democratic Charter—a declaration of our belief in democracy as the common 
form  of  government  for  all  countries  in  our  hemisphere.  On  Pan  American 
Day and during Pan American Week, we reflect on the progress our countries 
have  made  together,  and  we  recommit  to  reaching  for  a  brighter  day  for 
all our peoples. 
Throughout  our  hemisphere,  increased  integration  has  generated  greater 
growth  and  prosperity.  Since  I  took  office,  exports  and  imports  between 
the  United  States  and  the  rest  of  the  hemisphere  have  increased  by  more 
than  50  percent.  We  are  involved  in  more  trade  and  economic  partnerships 
that  reduce  poverty,  spur  opportunity,  and  empower  young  people  with 
the  skills  and  job  training  they  need  to  compete  in  the  global  economy. 
Our nations have partnered to develop clean, affordable, and reliable energy 
sources and ensure all countries have open access to data to combat climate 
change—a  reality  that  threatens  all  our  peoples  and  that  we  addressed  in 
Paris  late  last  year,  when  the  world  came  together  to  negotiate  the  most 
ambitious climate agreement in history. 
The  nations  of  the  Americas  have  made  tremendous  progress  on  important 
issues,  and  our  work  remains  rooted  in  the  bonds  of  friendship  and  family 
between  our  peoples.  For  too  long,  the  United  States  and  Cuba  remained 
isolated, and while our governments will continue to have areas of disagree-
ment,  our  people  have  long  shared  common  values  and  ideals.  That  is 
why  we  reestablished  diplomatic  relations  between  our  countries—for  the 
first  time  in  over  50  years,  the  American  flag  flies  above  our  reopened 
embassy  in  Havana;  and  I  recently  visited  our  neighbor  90  miles  to  the 
South,  becoming  the  first  United  States  President  to  do  so  in  nearly  nine 
decades.  By  extending  a  new  hand  of  friendship  to  the  Cuban  people, 
we  mark  the  beginning  of  a  relationship  that  will  offer  fresh  hope  for 
both our futures and improve the lives of those living in both our countries. 
Following  my  trip  to  Cuba,  I  visited  Argentina,  which  has  begun  advancing 
ambitious reforms to spur economic growth and has pledged to help address 
important  global  challenges,  such  as  peacekeeping  and  the  Syrian  refugee 
crisis. 
Across  the  board,  the  United  States  has  deepened  our  engagement  in  the 
Americas.  We  initiated  the  100,000  Strong  in  the  Americas  initiative  to 
encourage  more  exchanges  between  our  hemisphere’s  students.  Last  year, 
I launched the Young Leaders of the Americas Initiative, which will address 
opportunity gaps that persist for too many of our neighboring nations’ youth 
by  empowering  them  with  the  tools  and  resources  they  need  to  reach  their 
full  potential.  Just  as  our  countries  must  foster  hope  and  prosperity,  we 
must  also  address  serious  challenges.  We  will  continue  defending  and 
strengthening  civil  society,  because  when  all  our  people  have  a  voice  in

shaping  the  future  of  our  hemisphere,  we  all  do  better.  The  United  States 
is  working  with  Colombia  to  reduce  violence  and  achieve  peace,  as  we 
do  throughout  Central  America.  We  will  also  keep  coordinating  with  the 
nations  of  the  Americas  to  prevent,  detect,  and  respond  to  the  spread  of 
Zika.  And  later  this  year,  I  look  forward  to  joining  other  leaders  of  the 
Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  forum  in  Peru  for  the  next  Economic 
Leaders’ meeting. 
Millions  of  people  in  the  United  States  are  tied  to  the  rest  of  the  countries 
in  our  hemisphere  through  commerce  and  family.  We  are  more  than  just 
nations—we  are  neighbors,  bound  in  common  cause  and  possibility  not 
by  our  leaders,  but  by  the  citizens  of  the  Americas  and  the  interests  we 
share. Let us move forward, as one people, in a spirit of unity and coopera-
tion.  Together,  we  can  reach  a  future  in  which  every  young  person—from 
Argentina to Alaska—knows peace, dignity, and opportunity, and can embark 
on paths that stretch beyond their neighborhood and into the wider Western 
Hemisphere and the entire world. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  14,  2016, 
as Pan American Day and April 10 through April 16, 2016, as Pan American 
Week.  I  urge  the  Governors  of  the  50  States,  the  Governor  of  the  Common-
wealth  of  Puerto  Rico,  and  the  officials  of  the  other  areas  under  the  flag 
of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate 
ceremonies and activities. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  eighth  day 
of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9458  of  May  31,  2016 

National  Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

The  dynamism  and  diversity  of  Caribbean  Americans  have  contributed  to 
our  Nation’s  story  in  extraordinary  ways.  Millions  of  people  in  the  United 
States  are  connected  to  our  Caribbean  neighbors  through  ties  of  commerce 
and  family—a  relationship  reinforced  by  the  values  and  history  we  hold 
in  common.  During  National  Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month,  we  cele-
brate  the  contributions  of  our  Caribbean-American  brothers  and  sisters,  and 
we  reflect  on  how  they  have  bolstered  our  country  and  enriched  our  tradi-
tions. 

The  bonds  between  the  United  States  and  the  Caribbean  remain  strong. 
Both rooted in similar legacies—of trial and triumph, oppression and libera-
tion—our  narratives  have  advanced  on  a  similar  path  of  progress,  driven 
forward  by  our  shared  dedication  to  fostering  opportunity  and  forging  a 
brighter  future.  Caribbean  Americans  excel  in  our  universities,  inspire  us 
as  athletes  and  musicians,  guide  us  as  community  and  government  leaders, 
and keep us safe through dedicated service in our Armed Forces. 

The United States is committed to working with the nations of the Caribbean 
to  advance  security,  liberty,  and  prosperity.  That  is  why  we  have  begun 
a  new  chapter  in  our  relationship  with  Cuba—extending  a  new  hand  of 
friendship  to  the  Cuban  people  that  offers  fresh  hope  for  both  our  futures 
and will improve the lives of those living in both our countries. My Adminis-
tration  also  introduced  the  100,000  Strong  in  the  Americas  initiative  to 
provide  higher  education  exchanges  to  students  across  the  Western  Hemi-
sphere,  and  we  launched  the  Young  Leaders  of  the  Americas  Initiative 
to address persistent opportunity gaps in the Americas and to give emerging 
entrepreneurs  and  civil  society  leaders  the  resources  they  need  to  reach 
their  full  potential.  In  harnessing  the  spirit  and  boldness  of  young  people 
in  the  Caribbean  and  throughout  the  Americas,  and  in  channeling  their 
creativity  and  innovation,  we  can  continue  to  build  on  the  progress  we 
have  made.  And  by  carrying  out  Jamaican-American  poet  Claude  McKay’s 
call  to  ‘‘strive  on  to  gain  the  height  although  it  may  not  be  in  sight,’’ 
we  can  enable  more  young  people,  here  at  home  and  throughout  the  Carib-
bean, to reach for the change that is within their grasp. 

The  legacy  of  Caribbean  Americans  is  one  of  tenacity  and  drive;  it  reminds 
us  that  in  America,  with  faith  and  determination,  anything  is  possible. 
This month, let us honor the resilient heritage and rich history of Caribbean 
Americans,  and  let  us  reflect  upon  the  diversity  of  experiences  that  unites 
us as a people. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as National 
Caribbean-American  Heritage  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  celebrate 
the history and culture of Caribbean Americans with appropriate ceremonies 
and activities.

Proclamation  9447  of  May  13,  2016 

National  Hurricane  Preparedness  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Each  May,  Americans  set  aside  a  week  to  raise  awareness  of  the  threat 
posed by hurricanes—storms that can devastate communities, neighborhoods, 
and  local  economies.  The  high  winds,  heavy  rains,  lightning,  and  tornadoes 
that  can  come  with  these  powerful  storms  cause  serious  damage,  but  with 
proper  preparation  we  can  ensure  the  safety  of  ourselves  and  our  loved 
ones.  During  National  Hurricane  Preparedness  Week,  we  take  deliberate 
action  to  safeguard  our  communities  and  work  together  to  improve  our 
resilience to hurricanes. 
Our  Nation  is  better  prepared  than  ever  before  for  today’s  storms.  Our 
technology, forecasting, and models have improved, and we have new ways 
of  disseminating  vital  warnings  and  storm-tracking  information.  Still,  it  is 
never  too  early  to  prepare  for  a  potential  disaster.  I  urge  all  Americans 
to  visit  www.Ready.gov  and  www.Hurricanes.gov/prepare  to  find  key  infor-
mation  on  building  an  emergency  supply  kit  and  knowing  what  to  do 
when  disaster  strikes.  By  having  a  plan  ready,  with  ideas  about  how  to 
respond  to  warnings,  you  can  help  avoid  tragedy  befalling  you  and  your 
loved ones. Our communities are not resilient unless individuals have taken 
proper precautions. 
Hurricane  intensity  and  rainfall  are  projected  to  increase  as  a  result  of 
climate  change.  My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  ensuring  our  resilience 
in  response  to  these  climate  change-related  impacts.  We  are  working  with 
the  Congress,  the  private  sector,  and  communities  across  America  to  build 
climate-resilient  infrastructure,  and  we  are  cutting  red  tape  to  help  those 
in  need  of  recovery  assistance  better  navigate  the  environmental  reviews 
necessary  to  ensure  a  rapid  and  resilient  recovery.  The  Federal  Government 
is  coordinating  with  State  and  local  governments  to  ensure  their  climate 
action  plans  are  up  to  date  and  to  mitigate  the  worst  effects  of  hurricanes— 
including  through  making  buildings  more  resilient,  home  elevations,  and 
improving drainage—so people are in a better position to avoid loss, damage, 
and  interruption  of  critical  services,  and  so  our  communities  are  in  a  better 
position  to  recover  from  storms.  As  a  country,  we  continue  to  make  strides 
in achieving the National Preparedness Goal of a secure and resilient Nation 
with the capabilities required across communities to prevent, protect against, 
mitigate,  respond  to,  and  recover  from  threats  and  hazards  that  pose  the 
greatest risk. 
This past summer, our Nation commemorated the 10th anniversary of Hurri-
cane  Katrina—a  tragedy  that  claimed  the  lives  of  more  than  1,800  of  our 
fellow  Americans.  We  all  have  a  responsibility  to  step  up  and  take  action 
to protect our Nation from such devastating disasters. As we enter hurricane 
season,  let  us  renew  our  commitment  to  that  responsibility,  and  let  us 
unite in common purpose to safeguard our communities. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  15  through 
May 21, 2016, as National Hurricane Preparedness Week. I call upon govern-
ment  agencies,  private  organizations,  schools,  media,  and  residents  in  the

Title  3— 

The  President 

Proclamation  9407  of  March  18,  2016 

National  Poison  Prevention  Week,  2016 

15611 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  the  leading  cause  of  accidental  injury  death  in  the  United  States, 
poisonings  can  harm  people  of  all  ages  and  from  all  walks  of  life.  More 
than 90 percent of poisonings occur inside the home, and most are treatable 
and preventable. During National Poison Prevention Week, we work to ensure 
the  safety  of  our  homes  and  communities  by  learning  of  the  dangers  of 
poison and striving to prevent poisonings. 
The most common sources of poisoning in young children are items typically 
found  at  home,  including  cleaning,  cosmetic,  and  personal  care  products, 
as well as over-the-counter and prescription medications. Although children 
are  more  likely  to  be  poisoned,  adults—who  are  most  commonly  poisoned 
by  cleaning  products,  or  by  the  improper  use  of  sedatives,  antidepressants, 
pain  relievers,  or  prescription  drugs—are  far  more  likely  to  die  from  poison 
exposure. 
With  diligence  and  caution,  these  tragedies  can  be  avoided.  Make  sure 
household products are kept in their original bottles and away from children, 
and never mix such products together. Some poisonous materials and vapors 
are harder to identify, including carbon monoxide—a colorless and odorless, 
yet  very  dangerous,  gas.  Everyone  should  have  carbon  monoxide  detectors 
in their home, use them properly, and get them tested regularly. Medications 
should always be kept out of the reach of children, and whether prescription 
or  over-the-counter,  all  drugs  should  be  taken  safely  and  in  accordance 
with  guidance  on  the  label  or  as  prescribed  and  instructed  by  healthcare 
professionals.  To  learn  more  about  keeping  you  and  your  family  safe  from 
poison,  visit  www.PoisonHelp.HRSA.gov,  and  for  more  information  on  how 
to safely dispose of drugs, including by participating in the National Prescrip-
tion  Drug  Take-Back  Day  on  April  30,  visit  www.DEAdiversion.USDOJ.gov. 
We  can  all  play  a  role  in  preventing  poisoning  tragedies  from  occurring. 
Every  individual  can  take  steps  on  their  own  to  make  their  homes  safer 
and  to  learn  of  appropriate  actions  to  take  in  the  event  of  a  poisoning 
incident.  If  you  believe  someone  has  been  poisoned,  immediately  call  the 
Poison  Help  line  at  1–800–222–1222.  By  coming  together  to  secure  poten-
tially-toxic  materials  in  our  homes  and  communities  and  by  educating  our 
friends and family on methods of prevention, we can help ensure no person 
is deprived of a full and healthy life due to poisoning. 
To  encourage  Americans  to  learn  more  about  the  dangers  of  accidental 
poisonings  and  to  take  appropriate  preventative  measures,  the  Congress, 
by  joint  resolution  approved  September  26,  1961,  as  amended  (75  Stat. 
681)  has  authorized  and  requested  the  President  to  issue  a  proclamation 
designating the third week of March each year as ‘‘National Poison Prevention 
Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  March  20  through  March  26,  2016,  as 
National  Poison  Prevention  Week.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe 
this  week  by  taking  actions  to  protect  their  families  from  hazardous  house-
hold materials and misuse of prescription medicines.

Proclamation  9549  of  December  1,  2016 

To  Modify  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  of  the  United 
States  and  for  Other  Purposes 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
1.  Section  1205(a)  of  the  Omnibus  Trade  and  Competitiveness  Act  of  1988 
(the  ‘‘1988  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  3005(a))  directs  the  United  States  International 
Trade Commission (the ‘‘Commission’’) to keep the Harmonized Tariff Sched-
ule  of  the  United  States  (HTS)  under  continuous  review  and  periodically 
to recommend to the President such modifications to the HTS as the Commis-
sion  considers  necessary  or  appropriate  to  accomplish  the  purposes  set 
forth  in  that  subsection.  Pursuant  to  sections  1205(c)  and  (d)  of  the  1988 
Act (19 U.S.C. 3005(c) and (d)), the Commission has recommended modifica-
tions to the HTS to conform the HTS to amendments made to the International 
Convention  on  the  Harmonized  Commodity  Description  and  Coding  System 
and the Protocol thereto (the ‘‘Convention’’). 
2. Section 1206(a) of the 1988 Act (19 U.S.C. 3006(a)) authorizes the President 
to  proclaim  modifications  to  the  HTS  based  on  the  recommendations  of 
the  Commission  under  section  1205  of  the  1988  Act,  if  the  President  deter-
mines that the modifications are in conformity with United States obligations 
under  the  Convention  and  do  not  run  counter  to  the  national  economic 
interest  of  the  United  States.  I  have  determined  that  the  modifications  to 
the  HTS  proclaimed  in  this  proclamation  pursuant  to  section  1206(a)  of 
the  1988  Act  are  in  conformity  with  United  States  obligations  under  the 
Convention  and  do  not  run  counter  to  the  national  economic  interest  of 
the United States. 
3.  Presidential  Proclamation  6763  of  December  23,  1994,  implemented  with 
respect to the United States the trade agreements resulting from the Uruguay 
Round  of  multilateral  trade  negotiations,  including  Schedule  XX-United 
States  of  America,  annexed  to  the  Marrakesh  Protocol  to  the  General  Agree-
ment  on  Tariffs  and  Trade  1994  (Schedule  XX),  that  were  entered  into 
pursuant  to  sections  1102(a)  and  (e)  of  the  1988  Act  (19  U.S.C.  2902(a) 
and  (e)),  and  approved  in  section  101(a)  of  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreements 
Act (URAA) (19 U.S.C. 3511(a)). 
4.  Pursuant  to  the  authority  provided  in  section  111  of  the  URAA  (19 
U.S.C.  3521)  and  sections  1102(a)  and  (e)  of  the  1988  Act,  Proclamation 
6763  included  the  staged  reductions  in  rates  of  duty  that  the  President 
determined to be necessary or appropriate to carry out the terms of Schedule 
XX.  In  order  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  such  rates  of  duty  for  imported 
goods  under  tariff  categories  that  are  being  modified  to  reflect  the  amend-
ments  to  the  Convention,  I  have  determined  that  additional  modifications 
to  the  HTS  are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  the  duty  reductions 
previously  proclaimed,  including  certain  technical  or  conforming  changes 
within the tariff schedule. 
5.  Presidential  Proclamation  7857  of  December  20,  2004,  implemented  the 
United  States-Australia  Free  Trade  Agreement  (USAFTA)  with  respect  to 
the United States and, pursuant to section 201 of the United States-Australia 
Free  Trade  Agreement  Implementation  Act  (the  ‘‘USAFTA  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C. 
3805  note),  the  staged  reductions  in  rates  of  duty  that  the  President  deter-
mined  to  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  2.3,

and  the  schedule  of  reductions  with  respect  to  Morocco  set  forth  in  Annex 
IV  of  the  USMFTA.  In  order  to  ensure  the  continuation  of  such  staged 
reductions  in  rates  of  duty  for  originating  goods  under  tariff  categories 
that  are  being  modified  to  reflect  the  amendments  to  the  Convention,  I 
have  determined  that  additional  modifications  to  the  HTS  are  necessary 
or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed.

to  section  201  of  the  Dominican  Republic-Central  America-United  States

10. Presidential Proclamation 8783 of March 6, 2012, implemented the United 
States-Korea  Free  Trade  Agreement  (USKFTA)  with  respect  to  the  United 
States  and,  pursuant  to  section  201  of  the  United  States-Korea  Free  Trade 
Agreement  Implementation  Act  (the  ‘‘USKFTA  Act’’)  (19  U.S.C.  3805  note), 
the  staged  reductions  in  duty  that  the  President  determined  to  be  necessary 
or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  2.3,  2.5,  2.6,  and  the  schedule 
of  duty  reductions  with  respect  to  Korea  set  forth  in  Annex  2–B,  Annex 
4–B,  and  Annex  22–A  of  the  USKFTA.  In  order  to  ensure  the  continuation 
of  such  staged  reductions  in  rates  of  duty  for  originating  goods  under  tariff 
categories that are being modified to reflect the amendments to the Conven-
tion, I have determined that additional modifications to the HTS are necessary 
or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously proclaimed. 

11.  Presidential  Proclamation  8894  of  October  29,  2012,  implemented  the 
United  States-Panama  Trade  Promotion  Agreement  (PTPA)  with  respect  to 
the  United  States  and,  pursuant  to  section  201  of  the  United  States-Panama 
Trade Promotion Agreement Implementation Act (the ‘‘PTPA Act’’) (19 U.S.C. 
3805  note),  the  staged  reductions  in  duty  that  the  President  determined 
to  be  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  or  apply  articles  3.3,  3.5,  3.6, 
3.26,  3.27,  3.28,  and  3.29,  and  the  schedule  of  duty  reductions  with  respect 
to  Panama  set  forth  in  Annex  3.3  of  the  PTPA.  In  order  to  ensure  the 
continuation of such staged reductions in rates of duty for originating goods 
under  tariff  categories  that  are  being  modified  to  reflect  the  amendments 
to  the  Convention,  I  have  determined  that  additional  modifications  to  the 
HTS are necessary or appropriate to carry out the duty reductions previously 
proclaimed. 

12. Presidential Proclamation 9466 of June 30, 2016, implemented the World 
Trade  Organization  Declaration  on  the  Expansion  of  Trade  in  Information 
Technology  Products  (the  ‘‘Declaration’’)  and,  pursuant  to  section  111(b) 
of the URAA (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)), modified the HTS to include the schedule 
of  duty  reductions  necessary  or  appropriate  to  carry  out  the  Declaration. 
These modifications to the HTS were set out in Annex I to that proclamation, 
and  included  certain  technical  errors  that  affected  the  tariff  treatment  ac-
corded  to  certain  goods  covered  by  the  Declaration.  I  have  determined  that 
modifications to the HTS are necessary to correct the technical errors. 

13.  Presidential  Proclamation  9466  of  June  30,  2016,  implemented  amend-
ments  to  sections  112(b)(3)(A)  and  112(c)(1)  of  the  African  Growth  and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA) (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(A) and 3721(c)(1)), as amend-
ed  by  sections  103(b)(2)  and  103(b)(3)  of  the  Trade  Preferences  Extension 
Act of 2015 (TPEA) (Public Law 114–27). That proclamation, in part, modified 
the HTS to extend the regional apparel article program and the third-country 
fabric  program  through  September  30,  2025.  These  modifications  to  the 
HTS  included  certain  technical  errors.  I  have  determined  that  modifications 
to the HTS are necessary to correct the technical errors. 

14. Executive Order 13742 of October 7, 2016, authorized by the International 
Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.)  and  the  National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), revoked the ban on the importation 
into  the  United  States  of  any  jadeite  or  rubies  mined  or  extracted  from 
Burma  and  any  articles  of  jewelry  containing  jadeite  or  rubies  mined  or 
extracted from Burma. Presidential Proclamation 9383 of December 21, 2015, 
previously  modified  the  HTS  to  include  additional  U.S.  Note  4  to  Chapter 
71  of  the  HTS,  which  prohibited  the  importation  of  any  jadeite  or  rubies 
mined or extracted from Burma and any articles of jewelry containing jadeite 
or  rubies  mined  or  extracted  from  Burma.  Importation  of  those  products 
was  previously  prohibited  under  the  Burmese  Freedom  and  Democracy  Act 
of  2003  (the  ‘‘BFDA’’)  (Public  Law  108–61),  as  amended  by  section  6(a) 
of  the  Tom  Lantos  Block  Burmese  JADE  Act  of  2008  (the  ‘‘JADE  Act’’) 
(Public  Law  110–286),  before  its  expiration  on  July  28,  2013.  I  have  deter-
mined  that  the  deletion  of  additional  U.S.  Note  4  to  Chapter  71  of  the 
HTS is necessary to the implementation of Executive Order 13742.

15.  Section  604  of  the  Trade  Act  of  1974,  as  amended  (the  ‘‘Trade  Act’’) 
(19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance 
of  the  relevant  provisions  of  that  Act,  and  of  other  acts  affecting  import 
treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, 
continuance,  or  imposition  of  any  rate  of  duty  or  other  import  restriction. 
Section  1206(c)  of  the  1988  Act,  as  amended  (19  U.S.C.  3006(c)),  provides 
that  any  modifications  proclaimed  by  the  President  under  section  1206(a) 
of  that  Act  may  not  take  effect  before  the  thirtieth  day  after  the  date  on 
which  the  text  of  the  proclamation  is  published  in  the  Federal  Register. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

egories, and to make technical and conforming changes to existing provisions,

97099 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  it  is  hereby  ordered  as  follows:

Proclamation  9536  of  October  31,  2016 

National  Family  Caregivers  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Our  Nation  was  founded  on  the  fundamental  ideal  that  we  all  do  better 
when  we  look  out  for  one  another,  and  every  day,  millions  of  Americans 
from  every  walk  of  life  balance  their  own  needs  with  those  of  their  loved 
ones  as  caregivers.  During  National  Family  Caregivers  Month,  we  reaffirm 
our  support  for  those  who  give  of  themselves  to  be  there  for  their  family, 
friends, and neighbors in challenging times, and we pledge to carry forward 
the  progress  we  have  made  in  our  health  care  system  and  workplaces  to 
give caregivers the resources and flexibility they need. 

Each  of  us  may  find  ourselves  in  need  of  or  providing  care  at  some  point 
in  our  lives.  That  is  why  it  is  imperative  that  we  maintain  and  expand 
the  Affordable  Care  Act  (ACA).  At  the  time  Medicare  was  created,  only 
a  little  more  than  half  of  all  seniors  had  some  form  of  health  insurance. 
Today,  the  ACA  has  given  older  Americans  better  care  and  more  access 
to  discounted  prescriptions  and  certain  preventive  services  at  no  cost.  The 
ACA  has  also  expanded  options  for  home-  and  community-based  services, 
so  that,  with  the  help  of  devoted,  loving  caregivers,  more  Americans  are 
now  able  to  live  independently  and  with  dignity.  And  because  looking 
after an aging family member or a friend with a disability can be challenging, 
States  and  local  agencies  connect  individuals  with  caregiver  support  groups 
and  respite  care.  The  women  and  men  who  put  their  loved  ones  before 
themselves  show  incredible  generosity  every  day,  and  we  must  continue 
to support them in every task they selflessly carry out. 

Many  devoted  caregivers  across  our  country  also  attend  to  members  of 
our  Armed  Forces  when  they  return  home,  and  my  Administration  is  com-
mitted  to  improving  the  care  and  support  our  veterans  and  their  families 
receive.  For  over  5  years,  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  and  Dr.  Jill  Biden’s 
Joining  Forces  initiative  has  worked  to  ensure  those  who  look  after  our 
service  members  who  come  home  with  the  wounds  of  war—whether  they 
are  visible  or  not—have  the  community  and  Government  support  they  need 
to  help  their  siblings  and  spouses,  parents  and  children,  neighbors  and 
friends through one of the greatest battles they may face: the fight to recover 
and heal. 

This month, and every month, let us lift up all those who work to tirelessly 
advance  the  health  and  wellness  of  those  they  love.  Let  us  encourage  those 
who  choose  to  be  caregivers  and  look  toward  a  future  where  our  politics 
and  our  policies  reflect  the  selflessness  and  open-hearted  empathy  they 
show their loved ones every day. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as  National  Family  Caregivers  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  pay 
tribute  to  those  who  provide  for  the  health  and  well-being  of  their  family 
members, friends, and neighbors.

Proclamation  9438  of  April  29,  2016 

National  Small  Business  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Responsible  for  creating  nearly  two-thirds  of  net  new  jobs  in  the  United 
States  each  year  and  employing  more  than  half  of  all  Americans,  small 
businesses  have  always  been  a  vital  part  of  our  country’s  economy.  As 
outlets  for  creativity  and  ingenuity,  small  businesses  do  more  than  create 
jobs  and  foster  growth—they  represent  the  spirit  that  has  always  driven 
our Nation forward. Throughout National Small Business Week, we celebrate 
the  irreplaceable  role  these  enterprises  play  in  our  national  life  by  pledging 
to  support  them  and  equip  them  with  the  tools  and  resources  they  need 
to succeed. 
Across America, small businesses support economies, employ local residents, 
and  contribute  to  the  vibrancy  of  their  communities.  My  Administration 
is  dedicated  to  helping  these  businesses  and  the  entrepreneurs  who  took 
a  chance  on  turning  ideas  into  realities.  We  have  enacted  18  tax  cuts  for 
small  businesses,  and  because  of  the  Affordable  Care  Act,  a  tax  credit  of 
up  to  50  percent  is  available  for  certain  small  businesses  to  help  offset 
the  cost  of  insurance.  And  our  businesses  have  created  jobs  in  every  month 
since I signed this law. 
Our  Nation  does  best  when  we  help  our  startups  and  small  businesses 
expand  into  new  markets  and  offer  goods  and  services  to  more  people. 
Ninety-eight  percent  of  the  American  companies  that  export  are  small  and 
medium-sized  businesses,  but  less  than  5  percent  of  our  country’s  small 
businesses  export.  In  our  21st-century  economy,  it  is  imperative  that  we 
break  down  the  trade  barriers  that  too  often  hold  small  businesses  back 
from  extending  their  reach  to  those  abroad  to  sell  more  goods  made  in 
the United States. Last year, we reached an agreement with 11 other nations 
that  allows  us  to  write  the  rules  of  our  global  economy  and  gives  more 
of our people the fair shot at success they deserve. The Trans-Pacific Partner-
ship  will  eliminate  over  18,000  taxes  imposed  by  other  countries  on  our 
goods  and  services  and  level  the  playing  field  for  American  workers  and 
businesses,  and  I  look  forward  to  working  with  the  Congress  to  implement 
this agreement. 
My Administration has taken action to ensure the Federal Government does 
its  part  to  support  our  Nation’s  small  businesses.  During  fiscal  year  2015, 
we  awarded  an  all-time  high  of  more  than  a  quarter  of  eligible  Federal 
contracts  to  small  businesses,  and  we  made  great  strides  in  ensuring  more 
Government  contracts  are  given  to  women-owned  small  businesses—nearly 
$18  billion  worth.  We  have  launched  next-generation  manufacturing  hubs, 
and  we  have  made  more  online  tools  available  to  entrepreneurs  to  give 
them  the  resources  they  need  to  start  a  business  in  a  single  day—and 
the  Startup  in  a  Day  initiative  is  continuing  to  engage  with  all  levels  of 
government to streamline the process of beginning a business. 
Our  Nation’s  small  businesses  play  a  critical  role  in  generating  economic 
prosperity,  and  the  effort  poured  into  them  by  ordinary  citizens  across 
our  country  reflects  the  hard  work  and  determination  inherent  to  who  we 
are  as  a  people.  This  week,  we  renew  our  support  for  these  engines  of 
growth and recognize their incredible contributions to our country.

Proclamation  9519  of  October  7,  2016 

Leif  Erikson  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
More  than  1,000  years  ago,  an  intrepid  Scandinavian  explorer,  Leif  Erikson, 
embarked  on  a  voyage  that  landed  him  on  the  North  American  coast.  A 
son  of  Iceland  and  grandson  of  Norway,  Erikson  and  his  crew  are  believed 
to  be  the  first  Europeans  to  reach  the  shores  of  our  continent,  founding 
the Vinland settlement in modern-day Canada. Today, we recall Leif Erikson’s 
historic  journey  as  we  seek  to  carry  forward  the  bold  spirit  of  exploration 
that has inspired Nordic Americans for generations. 
Eight  centuries  after  Leif  Erikson’s  trip,  six  families  of  Norwegians  boarded 
a ship called Restauration bound for New York City. Following in Erikson’s 
footsteps,  these  individuals  sought  the  promise  of  freedom  and  opportunity 
America  offered  and  became  the  first  group  of  organized  American  immi-
grants  from  Norway.  Millions  of  Americans  proudly  trace  their  ancestry 
to Nordic countries, raised by parents and grandparents who crossed oceans 
to  carve  out  new  lives  for  their  families  and  help  steer  the  course  of  our 
country.  The  United  States  and  our  Nordic  partners  are  united  by  ties 
of family and friendship, history and heritage. Earlier this year, I was proud 
to  welcome  Nordic  leaders  to  the  White  House.  This  visit  illustrated  many 
of  the  values  and  interests  we  share—including  increasing  opportunity  for 
all and recognizing the inherent dignity of every human being. 
Nordic  countries  remain  some  of  our  most  reliable  and  effective  partners, 
steadfastly  helping  us  meet  the  shared  challenges  of  our  time.  We  remain 
grateful  for  their  friendship,  and  for  the  ways  the  Nordic  people  have  influ-
enced our country and enhanced the American melting pot. On Leif Erikson 
Day,  as  we  express  our  appreciation  for  the  myriad  contributions  of  Nordic 
Americans,  let  us  remember  the  discovery  that  set  this  profound  history 
in motion. 
To honor Leif Erikson and celebrate our Nordic-American heritage, the Con-
gress,  by  joint  resolution  (Public  Law  88–566)  approved  on  September  2, 
1964,  has  authorized  the  President  of  the  United  States  to  proclaim  October 
9 of each year as ‘‘Leif Erikson Day.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  9,  2016,  as  Leif  Erikson  Day.  I 
call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  ceremonies, 
activities, and programs to honor our rich Nordic-American heritage.

Proclamation  9481  of  August  31,  2016 

National  Preparedness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Americans  have  been  tested  by  trial  and  tragedy  since  our  earliest  days— 
but  year  after  year,  no  matter  the  hardship,  we  pull  through  and  forge 
ahead.  Fifteen  years  after  the  attacks  of  September  11,  we  reflect  on  our 
strength  as  a  Nation  when  anything  threatens  us.  Today,  as  the  residents 
of  Louisiana  mourn  the  loss  of  loved  ones  and  face  tremendous  damage 
caused  by  historic  floods,  we  are  reminded  of  what  Americans  do  in  times 
like  these—we  see  the  power  of  love  and  community  among  neighbors 
who  step  up  to  help  in  extraordinarily  difficult  circumstances.  Preparing 
ourselves  to  meet  the  unknown  challenges  of  tomorrow  is  a  duty  we  all 
share,  and  when  confronted  with  crisis  or  calamity,  we  need  to  have  done 
everything  possible  to  prepare.  During  National  Preparedness  Month,  we 
emphasize  the  importance  of  readying  ourselves  and  our  communities  to 
be resilient in the face of any emergency we may encounter. 
Although  my  Administration  continues  doing  everything  we  can  to  keep 
the American people safe, it is each citizen’s responsibility to be as prepared 
as  possible  for  emergencies.  Whether  in  the  form  of  natural  disasters  like 
hurricanes and earthquakes, or unspeakable acts of evil like terrorism, danger 
can arise at unexpected times and places. Fortunately, there are many things 
that  individuals,  families,  and  communities  can  do  to  improve  their  readi-
ness.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  take  proactive  steps  to  prepare  for  any 
situation  that  may  occur—including  signing  up  for  local  alerts,  checking 
insurance  coverage,  documenting  valuables,  creating  a  plan  for  emergency 
communication  and  evacuation,  and  having  a  fully  stocked  disaster  supply 
kit  on  hand.  And  I  encourage  those  in  the  business  community  to  prepare 
their employees, develop a business continuity plan, and engage in commu-
nity-level planning to help ensure our communities and private sector remain 
strong  when  faced  with  an  emergency.  For  information  on  how  to  better 
prepare  for  emergencies  that  are  common  in  your  area,  or  to  learn  about 
resources 
increasing  preparedness,  visit 
www.Ready.gov or www.Listo.gov. 
In the face of unpredictable threats and hazards, we are committed to improv-
ing  access  to  information  and  raising  awareness  of  the  importance  of  pre-
cautionary  measures.  Leaders  across  our  country  should  take  the  time  to 
review  the  2016  National  Preparedness  Report  and  find  ways  to  address 
the  vulnerabilities  it  highlights.  All  Americans  can  play  a  role  in  fulfilling 
our  National  Preparedness  Goal  by  addressing  the  risks  that  affect  them 
and participating in preparedness activities across our Nation. 
We  continue  to  collaborate  with  State,  local,  and  tribal  partners,  along  with 
those  in  the  public  and  private  sectors,  to  ensure  that  communities  in 
crisis  do  not  have  to  face  these  dangers  alone.  In  addition  to  coordinating 
relief  efforts  and  providing  rapid  response,  we  have  focused  on  supporting 
the  needs  of  survivors,  investing  in  affected  neighborhoods,  and  helping 
them  rebuild  their  communities  to  be  better,  stronger,  and  more  resilient. 
Federal agencies are also working to share resources with the public, promote 
the tools and technologies that could help during disasters, and offer prepara-
tion  strategies.  We  launched  America’s  PrepareAthon!  to  bring  communities

together  and  help  them  plan  for  emergencies,  and  on  September  30,  we 
encourage  a  national  day  of  action  to  spur  preparedness  efforts  from  coast 
to coast. 
Disasters  have  become  more  frequent  and  severe  as  our  climate  changes; 
both urban and rural areas are already feeling the devastating consequences, 
including severe droughts and higher sea levels, intense storms and wildfires, 
and  more  powerful  hurricanes  and  heat  waves.  Climate  change  poses  an 
imminent  and  lasting  threat  to  our  safety  and  national  security,  and  it 
is critical that we invest in our infrastructure and integrate the preparedness 
efforts  of  our  communities  to  improve  our  ability  to  respond  to  and  recover 
from the effects of our changing climate and extreme weather events. 
This  month,  we  pay  tribute  to  the  courageous  individuals  who  rush  to 
the  scene  of  disaster  for  their  dedication  to  our  safety  and  security,  no 
matter  the  price.  Let  us  recognize  that  each  of  us  can  do  our  part  to 
prepare  for  emergencies,  help  those  affected  by  disasters,  and  ensure  all 
our  people  have  the  necessary  resources  and  knowledge  to  protect  them-
selves.  Together,  we  will  remain  strong  and  resilient  no  matter  what  befalls 
us. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  2016 
as  National  Preparedness  Month.  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  recognize 
the importance of preparedness and work together to enhance our resilience 
and readiness. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of August, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9510  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

The  physical  and  emotional  scars  of  domestic  violence  can  cast  a  long 
shadow. Too many individuals, regardless of age, ability, sex, sexual orienta-
tion, gender identity, circumstance, or race, face the pain and fear of domestic 
violence.  During  National  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  Month,  we  shine 
a  light  on  this  violation  of  the  basic  human  right  to  be  free  from  violence 
and  abuse,  pledge  to  ensure  every  victim  of  domestic  violence  knows  they 
are  not  alone,  and  foster  supportive  communities  that  help  survivors  seek 
justice and enjoy full and healthy lives. 

Over  the  past  two  decades,  rates  of  domestic  violence  against  females  have 
dropped  by  nearly  three-quarters—but  there  is  still  much  work  to  do  to 
build  on  the  progress  we  have  made.  Nearly  1  in  4  women  and  1  in 
7  men  have  suffered  from  domestic  violence  by  an  intimate  partner.  All 
people  deserve  to  feel  safe  with  loved  ones,  and  my  Administration  is 
committed  to  eliminating  this  scourge  and  supporting  survivors’  healing— 
and  we  must  ensure  that  survivors  and  their  families  have  access  to  the 
resources, care, and support they need to do so. 

My  Administration  is  dedicated  to  ensuring  that  all  people  feel  safe  in 
all  aspects  of  their  lives,  which  is  why  I  proposed  significant  funding  for 
responding  to  domestic  violence  in  my  most  recent  budget  proposal.  We 
have also championed legislative action like the Family Violence Prevention 
and  Services  Act,  and  the  Affordable  Care  Act—which  ensures  that  most 
health  plans  cover  domestic  violence  screening  and  counseling  services  at 
no  additional  cost.  And  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act,  which  was  reau-
thorized  in  2013,  has  enhanced  and  expanded  protections  to  Native  Ameri-
cans,  immigrants,  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  and  transgender  individuals,  and 
victims who reside in public housing. 

This  is  progress  we  must  continue  to  invest  in  and  carry  forward.  Earlier 
this  year,  I  announced  a  series  of  commonsense  steps  my  Administration 
is  taking  to  reduce  gun  violence,  including  work  to  renew  our  domestic 
violence outreach efforts. Building on the work of our Police Data Initiative, 
the White House is promoting smart approaches to collecting data on domes-
tic violence offenses that balance transparency and accountability with victim 
safety  and  privacy.  And  victim  safety  should  also  be  a  priority  in  the 
workplace—a  truth  that  extends  to  the  Federal  Government.  That  is  why 
I directed all Federal agencies to adopt domestic violence workplace policies 
and encouraged employers to do the same. 

Our  agencies  have  taken  many  critical  actions  to  advance  this  cause.  For 
example,  the  Department  of  Justice  has  invested  millions  of  dollars  in  new 
initiatives  to  prevent  domestic  violence  homicides,  urge  law  enforcement 
agencies  to  identify  and  prevent  gender  bias  when  responding  to  domestic 
violence  and  sexual  assault,  and  expand  services  to  underserved  victims. 
And  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Development  recently  issued 
guidance  to  prevent  housing  discrimination  against  survivors  of  domestic 
violence.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  194 / Thursday,  October  6,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

Vice  President  Joe  Biden’s  leadership  has  helped  guide  our  progress  and 
worked  to  change  our  national  culture—which  too  often  tolerates  and  con-
dones  domestic  violence.  We  are  challenging  harmful  stereotypes  associated 
with  victims  of  domestic  violence  and  striving  to  bring  the  practice  of 
victim-blaming  to  an  end.  We  must  continue  to  recognize  survivors  who 
experience  disproportionate  rates  of  domestic  violence,  and  who  have  been 
placed  at  the  margins  for  generations,  including  women  of  color,  Native 
Americans,  individuals  with  disabilities,  members  of  the  LGBT  community, 
immigrants, and older adults. Along these lines, we also joined with Canada 
and Mexico to create the North American Working Group on Violence against 
Indigenous  Women  and  Girls,  working  together  to  enhance  responses  to 
violent crimes against indigenous women and girls in North America. 
Our  Nation’s  character  is  tested  whenever  this  injustice  is  tolerated.  When 
anyone is targeted by someone they place their trust in, we have a responsi-
bility  to  speak  up.  We  all  have  a  role  to  play  in  building  a  bright  and 
safe future for each other and for future generations. This month, we recommit 
to  standing  with  survivors  of  domestic  violence  and  to  doing  our  utmost 
to  extend  hope  and  healing  to  all  who  need  it.  If  you  or  someone  you 
know needs assistance, I encourage you to reach out to the National Domestic 
Violence  Hotline,  which  recently  engaged  in  its  4  millionth  conversation 
with  victims  and  survivors  of  domestic  violence,  by  calling  1–800–799– 
SAFE, or visiting www.TheHotline.org. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  Month.  I  call  on  all  Americans  to 
speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims 
of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirtieth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Proclamation  9489  of  September  9,  2016 

World  Suicide  Prevention  Day,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  year,  too  many  people  are  taken  from  us  by  suicide.  These  tragedies 
tear  at  families  and  communities,  leaving  behind  heartbroken  loved  ones 
who  suffer  immeasurably.  World  Suicide  Prevention  Day  is  a  time  to  join 
with  neighbors  across  the  globe  to  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  preventing 
suicide.  Here  at  home—thanks  to  dedicated  crisis  counselors  on  hotlines 
and  in  schools;  clinicians  and  other  health  professionals  in  hospitals  and 
mental  health  centers;  faith  leaders,  teachers,  friends,  and  family  members 
who  never  give  up  on  trying  to  make  a  meaningful  difference—lives  have 
been  saved.  Together,  we  can  get  people  critical  help  when  they  are  in 
crisis  and  raise  awareness  of  the  importance  of  preventing  suicide  in  every 
community. 
It is critical that we recognize the connections that mental health conditions 
and  substance  use  disorders  have  to  suicide,  as  well  as  how  other  external 
factors,  including  harassment,  bullying,  and  discrimination,  can  play  a  role. 
Suicide  can  touch  any  of  us—regardless  of  age,  gender,  or  race—and  leave 
a lasting mark on communities. We must strive to build safe and supportive 
environments  and  eliminate  the  stigma  surrounding  mental  health  issues 
that too often prevents people from seeking the care they need. 
No  one  should  feel  alone  when  facing  these  challenges—there  is  always 
hope, and always a helping hand. My Administration has served as a partner 
in  this  important  effort  through  the  National  Action  Alliance  for  Suicide 
Prevention—a public-private partnership through which the Federal Govern-
ment  has  helped  champion  suicide  prevention.  All  Americans  can  make 
a  difference  in  this  effort.  Reach  out  to  a  friend,  let  them  know  you  are 
there in moments of need, and encourage others to seek assistance—because 
empowering  others  to  find  the  strength  to  ask  for  help  and  lifting  up  those 
who  feel  alone  can  save  lives.  The  National  Suicide  Prevention  Lifeline 
provides  immediate  assistance  for  all  Americans  at  1–800–273–TALK,  and 
I  encourage  you  to  call  if  you  or  someone  you  know  is  in  need  of  help. 
Veterans,  service  members,  and  their  loved  ones  can  also  call  this  number 
to  reach  the  Veterans  Crisis  Line,  and  they  can  also  send  a  text  message 
to 838255. 
The  Affordable  Care  Act  provides  the  largest  expansion  of  mental  health 
coverage in a generation, and it has helped increase access to quality, afford-
able  health  insurance  for  all  Americans.  The  Act  prohibits  insurers  from 
discriminating  against  people  based  on  pre-existing  conditions  like  depres-
sion,  expands  mental  health  and  substance  use  disorder  parity  policies  to 
more than 60 million Americans, and requires that Health Insurance Market-
place  plans  cover  mental  health  and  substance  use  disorder  services.  Addi-
tionally,  my  Administration  proposed  a  new  $500  million  investment  to 
increase access to mental health care. And because more than 20,000 Ameri-
cans  each  year  take  their  own  lives  with  a  firearm,  we  must  do  all  we 
can to ensure people who need help get it and improve gun safety technology 
that can help prevent suicides. 
We  also  have  to  end  the  tragedy  of  suicide  among  our  troops  and  our 
veterans.  These  American  heroes  give  of  themselves  for  our  country,  and

they  deserve  the  best  from  us  in  return—so  long  as  any  veteran  is  suffering 
or  feels  like  they  have  nowhere  to  turn,  we  have  more  work  to  do.  In 
2014,  I  announced  19  Executive  actions  to  improve  mental  health  care 
for  our  veterans,  members  of  our  Armed  Forces,  and  their  loved  ones. 
And  last  year,  to  build  on  these  efforts,  I  signed  the  Clay  Hunt  Suicide 
Prevention  for  American  Veterans  Act  to  improve  how  we  serve  veterans 
with  post-traumatic  stress  and  other  illnesses.  By  increasing  peer  support 
and outreach to service members transitioning to civilian life, this Act makes 
it easier for veterans to find the care they need when they need it. 
The theme of this year’s World Suicide Prevention Day is ‘‘Connect. Commu-
nicate.  Care.’’  These  words  provide  a  roadmap  to  reaching  our  universal 
goal  of  suicide  prevention—encouraging  all  people  to  reach  out  to  those 
who  are  suffering  in  silence,  express  when  they  are  in  need  of  help,  and 
lift  up  those  around  them.  On  this  day,  we  are  reminded  that  help  is 
available  and  that  a  brighter  future  lies  ahead.  Let  us  honor  the  souls 
we  have  lost  too  soon  and  vow  to  do  everything  in  our  power  to  prevent 
suicide. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  September  10,  2016, 
as World Suicide Prevention Day. I call upon citizens, government agencies, 
organizations, health care providers, and research institutions to raise aware-
ness  of  the  mental  health  resources  and  support  services  available  in  their 
communities and encourage all those in need to seek the care and treatment 
necessary for a long and healthy life. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  ninth  day  of 
September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9647  of  September  29,  2017 

National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  we  observe  National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  our  Nation  joins 
in  solidarity  with  those  who  are  currently  battling  breast  cancer  and  we 
remember  those  we  have  lost  to  the  disease.  Too  many  Americans  endure 
the  pain  and  heartbreak  of  losing  a  family  member  or  friend  to  breast 
cancer. Memories of our loved ones, and their courage in the face of suffering, 
drive us to find a cure. 
More than 250,000 American women and 2,000 men will likely be diagnosed 
with some form of breast cancer in 2017. Fortunately, thanks to early detec-
tion  and  improved  treatment  options,  deaths  from  breast  cancer  have  de-
creased  significantly  in  the  last  decade.  The  First  Lady  and  I  encourage 
all  women  to  talk  to  their  healthcare  providers  about  mammograms  and 
other  methods  of  early  detection,  and  about  their  risk  of  developing  breast 
cancer, and what can be done to reduce that risk. 
My  Administration  is  helping  pave  the  way  for  medical  breakthroughs  to 
strengthen  our  fight  against  breast  cancer  by  leveraging  the  tools  provided 
under  the  21st  Century  Cures  Act.  Our  Nation’s  biomedical  research  labora-
tories, universities, and industry innovators are global leaders in discovering, 
developing,  and  advancing  the  medical  breakthroughs  necessary  to  better 
detect,  diagnose,  and  treat  breast  cancer.  Their  cutting-edge  therapies  are 
redefining  breast  cancer  care  and  giving  patients  and  families  affected  by 
this disease new hope that we will defeat it once and for all. 
During this month, we stand strong for those facing a breast cancer diagnosis, 
and  we  take  a  moment  to  thank  our  friends  and  family  who  tirelessly 
lend  their  support,  and  we  pause  to  reflect  on  those  we  have  lost  to  this 
terrible disease. Our Nation’s researchers, innovators, doctors, nurses, public 
health  professionals,  and  advocates  have  helped  improve  the  process  and 
possibility  of  recovery,  and  together  we  hope  to  forge  a  future  free  of  breast 
cancer.  By  raising  awareness  of  breast  cancer  and  supporting  research,  pre-
vention, and early detection, we will move closer to eradicating this disease. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2017  as 
National  Breast  Cancer  Awareness  Month.  I  encourage  citizens,  government 
agencies,  private  businesses,  nonprofit  organizations,  the  media,  and  other 
interested  groups  to  increase  awareness  of  how  Americans  can  fight  breast 
cancer. I also invite the Governors of the States and Territories and officials 
of  other  areas  subject  to  the  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  to  join  me 
in recognizing National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Proclamation  9602  of  April  28,  2017 

Loyalty  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On  Loyalty  Day,  we  recognize  and  reaffirm  our  allegiance  to  the  principles 
upon  which  our  Nation  is  built.  We  pledge  our  dedication  to  the  United 
States  of  America  and  honor  its  unique  heritage,  reminding  ourselves  that 
we  are  one  Nation,  under  God,  made  possible  by  those  who  have  sacrificed 
to  defend  our  liberty.  We  honor  our  Republic  and  acknowledge  the  great 
responsibility that self-governance demands of each of us. 
The  United  States  stands  as  the  world’s  leader  in  upholding  the  ideals 
of  freedom,  equality,  and  justice.  Together,  and  with  these  fundamental 
concepts  enshrined  in  our  Constitution,  our  Nation  perseveres  in  the  face 
of those who would seek to harm it. 
As  one  Nation,  we  will  always  stand  strong  against  the  threats  of  terrorism 
and  lawlessness.  The  loyalty  of  our  citizenry  sends  a  clear  signal  to  our 
allies  and  enemies  that  the  United  States  will  never  yield  from  our  way 
of  life.  Through  the  Department  of  Defense  and  other  national  security 
agencies,  we  are  working  to  destroy  ISIS,  and  to  secure  for  all  Americans 
the  liberty  terrorists  seek  to  extinguish.  We  humbly  thank  our  brave  service 
members and veterans who have worn our Nation’s uniform—from the Amer-
ican  Revolution  to  the  present  day.  Their  unwavering  loyalty  and  fidelity 
has made the world a safer, more free, and more just place. We are inspired 
by  their  pride  in  our  country’s  principles,  their  devotion  to  our  freedom, 
and  their  solemn  pledge  to  protect  and  defend  our  Constitution  against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
To  express  our  country’s  loyalty  to  individual  liberties,  to  limited  govern-
ment,  and  to  the  inherent  dignity  of  every  human  being,  the  Congress, 
by  Public  Law  85–529  as  amended,  has  designated  May  1  of  each  year 
as  ‘‘Loyalty  Day.’’  On  this  day,  we  honor  the  United  States  of  America 
and  those  who  uphold  its  values,  particularly  those  who  have  fought  and 
continue to fight to defend the freedom it affords us. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  1,  2017,  as  Loyalty  Day.  This  Loyalty 
Day, I call on all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies 
in  our  schools  and  other  public  places,  including  recitation  of  the  Pledge 
of  Allegiance  to  the  Flag  of  the  United  States  of  America.  I  also  call  upon 
all  Government  officials  to  display  the  flag  of  the  United  States  on  all 
Government buildings and grounds on that day.

Presidential Documents

Executive  Order  13768  of  January  25,  2017 

Enhancing  Public  Safety  in  the  Interior  of  the  United  States 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nation-
ality  Act  (INA)  (8  U.S.C.  1101  et  seq.),  and  in  order  to  ensure  the  public 
safety  of  the  American  people  in  communities  across  the  United  States 
as  well  as  to  ensure  that  our  Nation’s  immigration  laws  are  faithfully  exe-
cuted,  I  hereby  declare  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  to  be,  and  order, 
as follows: 
Section  1.  Purpose.  Interior  enforcement  of  our  Nation’s  immigration  laws 
is  critically  important  to  the  national  security  and  public  safety  of  the 
United  States.  Many  aliens  who  illegally  enter  the  United  States  and  those 
who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant 
threat  to  national  security  and  public  safety.  This  is  particularly  so  for 
aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States. 
Sanctuary  jurisdictions  across  the  United  States  willfully  violate  Federal 
law  in  an  attempt  to  shield  aliens  from  removal  from  the  United  States. 
These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people 
and to the very fabric of our Republic. 
Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities 
across  the  country,  solely  because  their  home  countries  refuse  to  accept 
their  repatriation.  Many  of  these  aliens  are  criminals  who  have  served  time 
in  our  Federal,  State,  and  local  jails.  The  presence  of  such  individuals 
in  the  United  States,  and  the  practices  of  foreign  nations  that  refuse  the 
repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest. 
Although  Federal  immigration  law  provides  a  framework  for  Federal-State 
partnerships  in  enforcing  our  immigration  laws  to  ensure  the  removal  of 
aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government 
has  failed  to  discharge  this  basic  sovereign  responsibility.  We  cannot  faith-
fully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes 
or  categories  of  removable  aliens  from  potential  enforcement.  The  purpose 
of  this  order  is  to  direct  executive  departments  and  agencies  (agencies) 
to  employ  all  lawful  means  to  enforce  the  immigration  laws  of  the  United 
States. 
Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to: 

(a)  Ensure  the  faithful  execution  of  the  immigration  laws  of  the  United 
States, including the INA, against all removable aliens, consistent with Article 
II,  Section  3  of  the  United  States  Constitution  and  section  3331  of  title 
5, United States Code; 

(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient 

and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States; 

(c)  Ensure  that  jurisdictions  that  fail  to  comply  with  applicable  Federal 

law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law; 

(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly 

removed; and 

(e)  Support  victims,  and  the  families  of  victims,  of  crimes  committed 

by removable aliens. 
Sec.  3.  Definitions.  The  terms  of  this  order,  where  applicable,  shall  have 
the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  18 / Monday,  January  30,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

Sec.  4.  Enforcement  of  the  Immigration  Laws  in  the  Interior  of  the  United 
States.  In  furtherance  of  the  policy  described  in  section  2  of  this  order, 
I  hereby  direct  agencies  to  employ  all  lawful  means  to  ensure  the  faithful 
execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable 
aliens. 
Sec.  5.  Enforcement  Priorities.  In  executing  faithfully  the  immigration  laws 
of  the  United  States,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  (Secretary)  shall 
prioritize  for  removal  those  aliens  described  by  the  Congress  in  sections 
212(a)(2),  (a)(3),  and  (a)(6)(C),  235,  and  237(a)(2)  and  (4)  of  the  INA  (8 
U.S.C.  1182(a)(2),  (a)(3),  and  (a)(6)(C),  1225,  and  1227(a)(2)  and  (4)),  as 
well as removable aliens who: 

(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense; 
(b)  Have  been  charged  with  any  criminal  offense,  where  such  charge 

has not been resolved; 

(c)  Have  committed  acts  that  constitute  a  chargeable  criminal  offense; 
(d)  Have  engaged  in  fraud  or  willful  misrepresentation  in  connection 

with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; 

(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; 
(f)  Are  subject  to  a  final  order  of  removal,  but  who  have  not  complied 

with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or 

(g)  In  the  judgment  of  an  immigration  officer,  otherwise  pose  a  risk  to 

public safety or national security. 
Sec.  6.  Civil  Fines  and  Penalties.  As  soon  as  practicable,  and  by  no  later 
than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance 
and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment 
and  collection  of  all  fines  and  penalties  that  the  Secretary  is  authorized 
under  the  law  to  assess  and  collect  from  aliens  unlawfully  present  in  the 
United  States  and  from  those  who  facilitate  their  presence  in  the  United 
States. 
Sec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through 
the  Director  of  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement,  shall,  to  the 
extent  permitted  by  law  and  subject  to  the  availability  of  appropriations, 
take  all  appropriate  action  to  hire  10,000  additional  immigration  officers, 
who  shall  complete  relevant  training  and  be  authorized  to  perform  the 
law  enforcement  functions  described  in  section  287  of  the  INA  (8  U.S.C. 
1357). 
Sec.  8.  Federal-State  Agreements.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch 
to  empower  State  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies  across  the  country 
to  perform  the  functions  of  an  immigration  officer  in  the  interior  of  the 
United States to the maximum extent permitted by law. 

(a)  In  furtherance  of  this  policy,  the  Secretary  shall  immediately  take 
appropriate  action  to  engage  with  the  Governors  of  the  States,  as  well  as 
local  officials,  for  the  purpose  of  preparing  to  enter  into  agreements  under 
section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)). 

(b)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law  and  with  the  consent  of  State  or 
local  officials,  as  appropriate,  the  Secretary  shall  take  appropriate  action, 
through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to author-
ize  State  and  local  law  enforcement  officials,  as  the  Secretary  determines 
are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers 
in  relation  to  the  investigation,  apprehension,  or  detention  of  aliens  in 
the  United  States  under  the  direction  and  the  supervision  of  the  Secretary. 
Such  authorization  shall  be  in  addition  to,  rather  than  in  place  of,  Federal 
performance of these duties. 

(c)  To  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Secretary  may  structure  each 
agreement  under  section  287(g)  of  the  INA  in  a  manner  that  provides  the 
most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdic-
tion.

Sec.  9.  Sanctuary  Jurisdictions.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch 
to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivi-
sion of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373. 

(a)  In  furtherance  of  this  policy,  the  Attorney  General  and  the  Secretary, 
in  their  discretion  and  to  the  extent  consistent  with  law,  shall  ensure  that 
jurisdictions  that  willfully  refuse  to  comply  with  8  U.S.C.  1373  (sanctuary 
jurisdictions)  are  not  eligible  to  receive  Federal  grants,  except  as  deemed 
necessary  for  law  enforcement  purposes  by  the  Attorney  General  or  the 
Secretary.  The  Secretary  has  the  authority  to  designate,  in  his  discretion 
and  to  the  extent  consistent  with  law,  a  jurisdiction  as  a  sanctuary  jurisdic-
tion. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against 
any  entity  that  violates  8  U.S.C.  1373,  or  which  has  in  effect  a  statute, 
policy,  or  practice  that  prevents  or  hinders  the  enforcement  of  Federal 
law. 

(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated 
with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer 
Outcome  Report  or  its  equivalent  and,  on  a  weekly  basis,  make  public 
a  comprehensive  list  of  criminal  actions  committed  by  aliens  and  any  juris-
diction  that  ignored  or  otherwise  failed  to  honor  any  detainers  with  respect 
to such aliens. 

(c)  The  Director  of  the  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  is  directed 
to  obtain  and  provide  relevant  and  responsive  information  on  all  Federal 
grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction. 
Sec.  10.  Review  of  Previous  Immigration  Actions  and  Policies.  (a)  The  Sec-
retary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority 
Enforcement  Program  (PEP)  described  in  the  memorandum  issued  by  the 
Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program 
known as ‘‘Secure Communities’’ referenced in that memorandum. 

(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures 
for  consistency  with  this  order  and,  if  required,  publish  for  notice  and 
comment  proposed  regulations  rescinding  or  revising  any  regulations  incon-
sistent  with  this  order  and  shall  consider  whether  to  withdraw  or  modify 
any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with 
the law. 

(c)  To  protect  our  communities  and  better  facilitate  the  identification, 
detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory 
parameters,  the  Secretary  shall  consolidate  and  revise  any  applicable  forms 
to  more  effectively  communicate  with  recipient  law  enforcement  agencies. 
Sec.  11.  Department  of  Justice  Prosecutions  of  Immigration  Violators.  The 
Attorney  General  and  the  Secretary  shall  work  together  to  develop  and 
implement  a  program  that  ensures  that  adequate  resources  are  devoted  to 
the  prosecution  of  criminal  immigration  offenses  in  the  United  States,  and 
to  develop  cooperative  strategies  to  reduce  violent  crime  and  the  reach 
of transnational criminal organizations into the United States. 
Sec.  12.  Recalcitrant  Countries.  The  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  and 
the  Secretary  of  State  shall  cooperate  to  effectively  implement  the  sanctions 
provided  by  section  243(d)  of  the  INA  (8  U.S.C.  1253(d)),  as  appropriate. 
The  Secretary  of  State  shall,  to  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law, 
ensure  that  diplomatic  efforts  and  negotiations  with  foreign  states  include 
as  a  condition  precedent  the  acceptance  by  those  foreign  states  of  their 
nationals who are subject to removal from the United States. 
Sec.  13.  Office  for  Victims  of  Crimes  Committed  by  Removable  Aliens.  The 
Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforce-
ment  to  take  all  appropriate  and  lawful  action  to  establish  within  U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, 
adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by remov-
able aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide 
quarterly  reports  studying  the  effects  of  the  victimization  by  criminal  aliens 
present in the United States.

Proclamation  9562  of  December  28,  2016 

National  Stalking  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Every  year,  stalkers  deny  too  many  people  the  comfort  and  safety  they 
deserve, violating our basic expectation of dignity and respect for all. Posing 
risks to both the physical and emotional health of victims, stalking is recog-
nized as a crime across our Nation. This month, we join together in support 
of  victims  to  raise  awareness  of  this  threat  and  reaffirm  the  importance 
of  ensuring  every  person  can  live  free  from  fear  of  violence,  harassment, 
and any form of stalking. 
Approximately  1  in  6  women  and  1  in  19  men  will  be  victims  of  stalking. 
Perpetrators  of  stalking  seek  power  and  control  by  following,  harassing, 
or  pursuing  victims  in  unwanted  or  repeated  ways.  Stalking  can  occur 
digitally—through  cell  phones  and  on  social  media  platforms—as  well  as 
in person through repeated threats or acts of physical violence. And whether 
committed by acquaintances, former partners, or strangers, stalking can cause 
anxiety,  depression,  and  feelings  of  helplessness,  as  well  as  a  wide  variety 
of  general  health  and  sleeping  problems.  Stalking  victims  live  with  the 
fear  of  not  knowing  what  will  happen  next,  and  many  are  often  forced 
to  change  their  daily  activities,  move  to  a  different  location,  or  take  time 
off from school or work. 
Along with combating domestic violence, dating violence, and sexual assault, 
confronting  stalking  and  supporting  victims  is  an  important  part  of  my 
Administration’s  efforts  to  end  violence  against  women.  And  to  ensure  that 
violence against women, including stalking, is never tolerated, Vice President 
Biden  has  also  led  efforts  to  help  change  this  culture.  In  2013,  I  signed 
the  reauthorization  of  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act,  which  identifies 
stalking  as  a  key  focus  area  in  which  we  can  improve  support  for  victims. 
Because of an Executive Order I signed in 2015, victims employed by Federal 
contractors  can  now  use  paid  sick  leave  for  absences  related  to  stalking, 
and in the past year, many Federal agencies have also increased their support 
for  victims  as  part  of  ongoing  work  to  address  the  effects  of  domestic 
violence  in  the  workplace.  The  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban  Develop-
ment  recently  finalized  a  new  rule  that  strengthens  housing  protections 
for  stalking  victims,  helping  to  secure  their  basic  right  to  a  safe  living 
environment.  And  through  a  new  Government-wide  training  tool  designed 
to educate Federal employees on how to recognize and respond to stalking— 
and  how  to  support  colleagues  who  may  be  victims—we  have  worked  to 
enhance policies that support affected employees. 
Nobody  should  ever  feel  unsafe  in  their  homes  and  communities,  which 
is  why  we  must  work  to  lift  up  victims  and  survivors  who  know  the 
distress  and  anxiety  of  being  stalked.  Throughout  National  Stalking  Aware-
ness  Month,  let  us  reaffirm  the  value  of  privacy  and  security  for  all  as 
we  continue  striving  to  ensure  offenders  are  held  accountable.  If  we  pursue 
such  progress  and  change  with  the  passion  and  empathy  that  victims  of 
stalking  deserve,  we  can  build  a  future  where  all  people  are  free  to  live 
out their dreams. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution

resolve  to  support  victims  and  survivors,  and  to  create  communities  that 
are secure and supportive for all Americans. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-eighth 
day  of  December,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of

Notice  of  January  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Ter-
rorists  Who  Threaten  To  Disrupt  the  Middle  East  Peace  Proc-
ess 

On  January  23,  1995,  by  Executive  Order  12947,  the  President  declared 
a  national  emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United 
States  constituted  by  grave  acts  of  violence  committed  by  foreign  terrorists 
that disrupt the Middle East peace process. On August 20, 1998, by Executive 
Order  13099,  the  President  modified  the  Annex  to  Executive  Order  12947 
to  identify  four  additional  persons  who  threaten  to  disrupt  the  Middle 
East  peace  process.  On  February  16,  2005,  by  Executive  Order  13372,  the 
President clarified the steps taken in Executive Order 12947. 

These  terrorist  activities  continue  to  threaten  the  Middle  East  peace  process 
and  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security, 
foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the 
national emergency declared on January 23, 1995, and the measures adopted 
to  deal  with  that  emergency  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  January  23, 
2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emer-
gencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national 
emergency  with  respect  to  foreign  terrorists  who  threaten  to  disrupt  the 
Middle East peace process. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Notice  of  May  8,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Yemen 

On  May  16,  2012,  by  Executive  Order  13611,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Pow-
ers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  con-
stituted  by  the  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government 
of  Yemen  and  others.  These  actions  and  policies  threatened  Yemen’s  peace, 
security,  and  stability,  including  by  obstructing  the  political  process  in 
Yemen  and  the  implementation  of  the  agreement  of  November  23,  2011, 
between  the  Government  of  Yemen  and  those  in  opposition  to  it,  which 
provided for a peaceful transition of power that meets the legitimate demands 
and aspirations of the Yemeni people for change. 

The  actions  and  policies  of  certain  members  of  the  Government  of  Yemen 
and  others  in  threatening  Yemen’s  peace,  security,  and  stability  continue 
to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat  to  the  national  security  and 
foreign  policy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency 
declared  on  May  16,  2012,  to  deal  with  that  threat  must  continue  in  effect 
beyond  May  16,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the 
National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year 
the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Proclamation  9584  of  March  31,  2017 

National  Financial  Capability  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  ability  of  Americans  to  plan,  save,  and  invest  is  vital  to  their  building 
wealth  and  pursuing  the  American  Dream.  One  of  my  first  actions  as  Presi-
dent was to issue an Executive Order entitled ‘‘Core Principles for Regulating 
the  United  States  Financial  System,’’  and  its  first  core  principle  is  that 
financial regulation should ‘‘empower Americans to make independent finan-
cial  decisions  and  informed  choices  in  the  marketplace,  save  for  retirement, 
and build individual wealth.’’ 
Empowering  Americans  to  make  independent  financial  decisions  and  in-
formed  choices  is  critically  important  to  our  Nation’s  prosperity.  Yet  more 
than  half  of  households  today  do  not  have  3  months  of  funds  saved  for 
emergency,  and  most  families  with  children  are  not  currently  saving  for 
college.  In  addition,  a  majority  of  working  Americans  worry  about  running 
out of money in retirement, and nearly a third of workers have no retirement 
savings at all. 
We  must  address  these  challenges.  Creating  and  implementing  innovative 
financial  education  curriculums  is  critical.  For  example,  the  Department 
of  Defense  has  made  long-term  financial  security  education  opportunities 
available  for  our  service  members  and  their  families.  As  a  result,  the  men 
and  women  of  the  Armed  Forces  can  plan  a  healthy  financial  future  by 
seeking advice from personal financial managers and counselors. 
My  Administration  will  work  with  committed  organizations  in  all  sectors 
to  improve  financial  education  and  share  best  practices  so  that  all  Ameri-
cans—no matter their income, education, or background—have the capability 
to  make  sound  financial  decisions.  Together,  we  will  empower  Americans 
to  take  advantage  of  the  many  opportunities  they  have  to  attain  more  finan-
cially secure and prosperous futures for themselves and their families. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 2017 as National 
Financial Capability Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month 
by  engaging  in  activities  that  improve  their  understanding  of  important 
financial decisions.

Proclamation  9622  of  May  31,  2017 

National  Ocean  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
National  Ocean  Month  celebrates  the  mighty  oceans  and  their  extraordinary 
resources.  This  month,  we  recognize  the  importance  of  harnessing  the  seas 
for our national security and prosperity. 
Thirty-four  years  ago,  President  Ronald  Reagan  proclaimed  the  creation  of 
the  U.S.  Exclusive  Economic  Zone,  making  clear  America’s  sovereign  right 
to  explore,  exploit,  conserve,  and  manage  ocean  resources  extending  200 
nautical miles from our shores. This is the world’s largest Exclusive Economic 
Zone,  spanning  more  than  3.4  million  square  nautical  miles—an  area  larger 
than the combined landmass of all 50 States. We must recognize the impor-
tance  of  our  offshore  areas  to  our  security  and  economic  independence, 
all  while  protecting  the  marine  environment  for  present  and  future  genera-
tions. 
Today,  our  offshore  areas  remain  underutilized  and  often  unexplored.  We 
have  yet  to  fully  leverage  new  technologies  and  unleash  the  forces  of  eco-
nomic  innovation  to  more  fully  develop  and  explore  our  ocean  economy. 
In  the  field  of  energy,  we  have  just  begun  to  tap  the  potential  of  our 
oceans’  oil  and  gas,  wind,  wave,  and  tidal  resources  to  power  the  Nation. 
The  fisheries  resources  of  the  United  States  are  among  the  most  valuable 
in the world. Growing global demand for seafood presents tremendous oppor-
tunities  for  expansion  of  our  seafood  exports,  which  can  reduce  our  more 
than $13 billion seafood trade deficit. 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, by virtue of the authority vested 
in  me  by  the  Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby 
proclaim  June  2017  as  National  Ocean  Month.  This  month,  I  call  upon 
Americans  to  reflect  on  the  value  and  importance  of  the  oceans  not  only 
to  our  security  and  economy,  but  also  as  a  source  of  recreation,  enjoyment, 
and relaxation.

Proclamation  9614  of  May  19,  2017 

World  Trade  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Robust  trade  is  critical  to  the  economic  strength  of  our  country.  During 
World  Trade  Week,  we  recognize  the  power  of  open  markets  around  the 
world  and  celebrate  the  many  benefits  that  fair  international  commerce 
can  bring  to  our  Nation.  We  also  highlight  the  importance  of  expanded 
trade  to  our  economic  growth,  and  we  commit  to  breaking  down  trade 
barriers and opening new markets for American exports. 
Open,  fair,  and  competitive  markets  increase  opportunities  for  American 
workers  and  employers  and  contribute  to  a  higher  standard  of  living.  Job 
creation  with  increased  wages  is  a  top  priority  of  my  Administration,  and 
increasing  trade—while  reducing  our  trade  deficit—is  a  key  component  of 
that  mission.  We  will  promote  our  economic  growth  by  strengthening  our 
manufacturing  base  and  expanding  exports  in  manufacturing,  agriculture, 
and  the  service  industries.  We  will  also  challenge  unfair  trade  practices 
that  leave  American  workers,  farmers,  and  businesses  competing  in  global 
markets at a disadvantage. 
Trade  has  a  large  role  in  the  United  States  economy  today,  but  it  can 
be  even  greater.  Our  exports  contribute  $2.2  trillion,  or  12  percent,  to  our 
national  income,  supporting  11.5  million  private-sector  jobs.  Manufacturing 
exports  total  $1.265  trillion,  behind  only  China  and  Germany.  The  United 
States  leads  the  world  in  both  agricultural  exports,  which  currently  total 
$139  billion,  and  services  exports,  at  $750  billion  today.  The  United  States, 
however,  has  a  large  and  persistent  trade  deficit  in  manufacturing,  overall 
as  well  as  with  certain  trading  partners.  Through  an  increased  commitment 
to  opening  markets,  reducing  barriers  to  our  goods,  and  firmly  addressing 
unfair trade practices, we can do far better for American workers and manu-
facturers. 
My  Administration  will  negotiate  future  trade  agreements  that  ensure  that 
all  Americans  reap  the  benefits  of  global  commerce.  This  includes  small 
businesses,  which  are  the  backbone  of  our  economy.  While  past  agreements 
have  not  always  accounted  for  the  consequential  effects  of  trade  on  small 
businesses and the American workforce, future agreements will. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  21  through 
May  27,  2017,  as  World  Trade  Week.  I  encourage  Americans  to  observe 
this week with events, trade shows, and educational programs that celebrate 
the benefits of trade to our country.

Proclamation  9654  of  October  6,  2017 

National  School  Lunch  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  health  and  well-being  of  our  children  is  vital  to  the  success  of  our 
Nation.  When  our  Nation’s  youth  have  their  basic  needs  fulfilled,  they 
can better focus on succeeding in school and in life. During National School 
Lunch  Week,  we  recognize  the  benefits  that  school  lunch  programs  offer 
to our communities and to our Nation’s future. 
The National School Lunch Program is a partnership between Federal, State, 
and local governments working together to facilitate the health and develop-
ment  of  our  Nation’s  children.  Since  its  inception  more  than  70  years  ago, 
millions  of  students  have  received  low-cost  or  free  meals  and  learned  life- 
long healthy eating habits. Today, the National School Lunch Program serves 
more  than  31  million  students  every  school  day,  at  nearly  100,000  schools 
and residential child-care institutions across our Nation. 
For  many  children,  school  lunch  may  be  their  most  substantial  meal  of 
the  day.  Adequate  nutrition  is  essential  to  a  child’s  mental,  physical,  and 
emotional  well-being,  and  students  who  lack  sufficient  vitamins  and  min-
erals,  such  as  iron,  vitamin  E,  vitamin  B,  thiamine,  iodine,  and  zinc,  may 
suffer  from  inhibited  cognitive  functioning  and  a  diminished  ability  to  con-
centrate.  Poor  nutrition,  especially  from  excess  sugar  consumption,  may 
also  lead  to  behavioral  problems.  School  lunches,  in  addition  to  providing 
balanced  nutrition,  can  teach  students  the  relationship  between  nutrition 
and classroom performance. 
The  Congress  created  the  National  School  Lunch  Act  to,  ‘‘safeguard  the 
health  and  well-being  of  the  Nation’s  children.’’  More  than  seven  decades 
later, dedicated Americans continue to work to ensure the nutritional health 
of  our  greatest  treasure—our  young  people.  During  National  School  Lunch 
Week,  we  recognize  the  food  service  professionals,  school  administrators, 
community  members,  parents,  and  all  those  who  dedicate  themselves  to 
the  health  of  our  schoolchildren.  To  emphasize  the  importance  of  the  Na-
tional  School  Lunch  Program  to  our  youth’s  nutrition,  the  Congress,  by 
joint  resolution  of  October  9,  1962  (Public  Law  87–780),  as  amended,  has 
designated  the  week  beginning  on  the  second  Sunday  in  October  each  year 
as  ‘‘National  School  Lunch  Week’’  and  has  requested  the  President  to  issue 
a proclamation in observance of this week. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  8  through 
October 14, 2017, as National School Lunch Week. I call upon all Americans 
to join the countless individuals who administer the National School Lunch 
Program  in  activities  that  support  and  promote  awareness  of  the  health 
and well-being of our Nation’s children.

Proclamation  9643  of  September  15,  2017 

Prescription  Opioid  and  Heroin  Epidemic  Awareness  Week, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness Week, we draw 
renewed  attention  to  the  scourge  that  continues  to  devastate  individuals, 
families,  and  communities  across  our  Nation.  Preliminary  data  indicates 
that  approximately  64,000  Americans  died  last  year  of  drug  overdoses  in 
the United States, the majority of them from opioids. The number of infants 
born with opioid dependence has more than quadrupled in the past decade. 
Nearly  100  Americans,  on  average,  die  each  day  from  opioid  overdoses, 
and  overdose  rates  are  highest  among  people  between  25  to  54  years  old, 
robbing  so  many  of  our  young  people  of  their  potential.  This  is  a  genuine 
crisis that my Administration is working tirelessly to address. 
The  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  is  leading  an  interagency 
effort  to  maximize  the  effect  of  the  Comprehensive  Addiction  and  Recovery 
Act  (CARA)  and  21st  Century  Cures  Act  (Cures  Act)  programs.  In  March, 
I  issued  an  Executive  Order  establishing  the  President’s  Commission  on 
Combating  Drug  Addiction  and  the  Opioid  Crisis  (Commission)  to  study 
how  the  Federal  Government  can  most  effectively  address  the  epidemic. 
The  Commission  will  release  its  final  recommendations  this  fall,  and  my 
Administration  will  rely  on  its  findings  to  inform  a  whole-of-government 
emergency  response  plan.  In  addition,  my  FY  2018  Budget  commits  signifi-
cant resources to fighting this epidemic, including $1.3 billion in investments 
for  CARA  and  Cures  Act  programs,  and  other  opioid-related  initiatives  that 
seek  to  prevent  opioid  abuse,  improve  access  to  treatment  and  recovery 
support services, and enhance overdose prevention programs. 
This  week,  we  reaffirm  our  commitment  to  fighting  the  opioid  and  heroin 
epidemic.  Too  many  families  know  the  enduring  personal,  emotional,  and 
financial  harm  caused  by  prescription  opioid  and  heroin  addiction.  To  the 
men  and  women  who  are  currently  seeking  or  receiving  treatment  and 
to  those  who  are  in  recovery:  We  stand  with  you,  we  pray  for  you,  and 
we  are  working  every  single  day  to  help  you.  As  a  Nation,  we  will  come 
together to save lives and end this crisis. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim September 17 through 
September 23, 2017, as Prescription Opioid and Heroin Epidemic Awareness 
Week. I call upon my fellow Americans to observe this week with appropriate 
programs, ceremonies, religious services, and other activities that raise aware-
ness about the prescription opioid and heroin epidemic.

Proclamation  9459  of  May  31,  2016 

National  Oceans  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

Covering more than 70 percent of the earth’s surface, oceans have a profound 
impact  on  our  way  of  life.  Home  to  a  great  diversity  of  plant  and  animal 
species,  their  precious  ecosystems  provide  food  and  energy  that  are  integral 
to  our  survival.  In  bringing  tourism  and  recreation  to  coastal  areas,  oceans 
are  important  to  America’s  economy,  and  they  help  facilitate  trade  and 
transportation, give mobility to our Armed Forces, and preserve our Nation’s 
maritime  heritage.  In  observation  of  National  Oceans  Month,  we  recommit 
to  good  ocean  stewardship  and  redouble  our  efforts  to  preserve  the  health 
and resilience of our vast oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. 

Jeopardizing  marine  populations  and  degrading  oceanic  habitats,  pollution 
poses  a  significant  risk  to  all  of  our  interconnected  oceans.  Oceans  and 
their  nearby  regions  are  also  highly  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  a  changing 
climate—a  once-distant  threat  that  is  now  very  present  and  is  affecting 
ecosystems  and  shoreline  communities  on  every  coast.  Rising  sea  levels, 
coastal  storms,  and  a  growing  risk  of  erosion  and  flooding  are  looming 
realities  faced  by  seaside  towns.  It  is  critical  that  we  take  measures  to 
safeguard  our  blue  planet  and  heed  the  urgency  to  defend  against  these 
mounting  threats,  particularly  in  the  Arctic  where  the  effects  of  a  changing 
climate are already swiftly accelerating. 

In  collaboration  with  stakeholders;  scientists;  businesses;  and  State,  tribal, 
and  local  partners,  my  Administration  is  continuing  to  implement  the  Na-
tional  Ocean  Policy,  a  coordinated  effort  to  support  local  communities, 
strengthen  our  ocean  economy,  and  improve  the  health  of  our  oceans.  We 
are  concentrating  on  key  areas  outlined  in  our  2016  Annual  Work  Plan, 
including combatting illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing and moni-
toring  significant  changes  in  the  acidity  of  our  oceans.  We  are  also  focused 
on  reducing  the  toxic  effects  of  harmful  algal  blooms,  which  occur  when 
algae  grow  too  rapidly  and  threaten  the  safety  of  our  food,  drinking  water, 
and  air  quality.  Using  the  science-based  roadmap  laid  out  in  the  National 
Ocean  Policy,  we  are  dedicated  to  enhancing  the  economic  and  ecological 
sustainability  of  our  oceans  and  advancing  our  knowledge  of  how  they 
influence and are influenced by human activity. 

This  month,  let  us  continue  the  work  of  ensuring  the  well-being  of  these 
grand  bodies  of  water  and  the  communities  that  depend  on  them.  As  we 
celebrate  the  immense  beauty  and  power  of  our  oceans,  we  are  reminded 
of  our  shared  responsibility  to  protect  them—now  and  for  generations  to 
come. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2016 as National 
Oceans  Month.  I  call  upon  Americans  to  take  action  to  protect,  conserve, 
and restore our oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.

Proclamation  9448  of  May  13,  2016 

Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  Police  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
For generations, the brave women and men of our Nation’s law enforcement 
have  answered  the  call  to  serve  and  protect  our  communities.  Enduring 
long shifts in dangerous and unpredictable circumstances, our Nation’s peace 
officers  embody  the  courage  and  honor  that  represent  the  best  of  America. 
On  Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day  and  during  Police  Week,  we  express  our 
gratitude  for  the  selfless  public  servants  who  wear  the  badge  and  put  them-
selves  in  harm’s  way  to  keep  us  safe,  and  we  pay  respect  for  those  who 
lost their lives in the line of duty. 
In  moments  of  danger  and  desperation,  the  first  people  we  turn  to  are 
law  enforcement  officers.  These  often  unsung  heroes  risk  their  lives  and 
sacrifice  precious  time  with  loved  ones  so  their  fellow  Americans  can  live 
in  peace  and  security.  But  more  than  that,  they  are  leaders  in  their  commu-
nities, serving as mentors, coaches, friends, and neighbors—working tirelessly 
each  day  to  ensure  that  the  people  they  serve  have  the  opportunities  that 
should  be  afforded  to  all  Americans.  In  honor  of  all  they  do,  we  must 
give these dedicated professionals the support and appreciation they deserve. 
My  Administration  continues  to  work  to  ensure  police  departments  and 
other  law  enforcement  agencies  throughout  our  country  have  the  resources 
required  to  hire,  train,  and  retain  officers,  provide  officers  with  modern 
and  necessary  equipment,  and  utilize  technology  to  enhance  their  commu-
nication networks. And our Federal law enforcement officers regularly partner 
with  their  State  and  local  counterparts  to  address  some  of  our  Nation’s 
most difficult problems. We know that strong community bonds are essential 
for  law  enforcement  to  do  their  jobs  effectively.  I  established  a  Task  Force 
on  21st  Century  Policing,  bringing  together  law  enforcement,  academia, 
youth, civil rights, and community leaders to provide concrete recommenda-
tions to enhance public safety while building community trust. Law enforce-
ment  officials  care  deeply  about  their  communities,  and  together  with  our 
partners  in  law  enforcement,  we  must  work  to  build  up  our  neighborhoods, 
prevent  crime  before  it  happens,  and  put  opportunity  within  reach  for  all 
our people. 
Because  each  fallen  peace  officer  is  one  too  many,  I  proudly  signed  the 
Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act last year—bipartisan 
legislation  that  establishes  a  national  ‘‘Blue  Alert’’  communications  network 
to  disseminate  information  about  threats  to  officers.  The  legislation  seeks 
to  ensure  that  appropriate  steps  can  be  taken  as  quickly  as  possible  to 
provide  for  an  officer’s  safety.  I  also  announced  new,  commonsense  gun 
safety  reforms  to  help  keep  guns  out  of  the  wrong  hands  and  emphasized 
that  the  already  dangerous  job  of  an  officer  is  far  more  dangerous  than 
it  should  be  because  it  remains  too  easy  for  criminals  and  people  who 
are a danger to others or themselves to have access to guns. 
It  takes  a  special  kind  of  courage  to  be  a  peace  officer.  Whether  deputies 
or  detectives,  tribal  police  or  forest  service  officers,  beat  cops  or  Federal 
agents,  we  hold  up  those  who  wear  the  badge  as  heroes.  Though  they 
too  often  spend  their  days  witnessing  America  at  its  worst,  in  their  extraor-
dinary  examples,  we  see  America  at  its  best.  On  this  day  and  throughout

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  96 / Wednesday,  May  18,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

this  week,  let  us  celebrate  those  who  nobly  serve  each  day—and  remember 
those  who  made  the  ultimate  sacrifice—to  move  our  world  toward  a  more 
just  and  safe  tomorrow.  May  we  carry  forward  their  brave  and  selfless 
spirit as we keep working together to shape a future worthy of their commit-
ment. 
By  a  joint  resolution  approved  October  1,  1962,  as  amended  (76  Stat.  676), 
and by Public Law 103–322, as amended (36 U.S.C. 136–137), the President 
has  been  authorized  and  requested  to  designate  May  15  of  each  year  as 
‘‘Peace  Officers  Memorial  Day’’  and  the  week  in  which  it  falls  as  ‘‘Police 
Week.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  15,  2016,  as  Peace  Officers  Memorial 
Day  and  May  15  through  May  21,  2016,  as  Police  Week.  I  call  upon  all 
Americans to observe these events with appropriate ceremonies and activities.

all Americans to display the flag at half-staff from their homes and businesses 
on that day. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirteenth  day 
of  May,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the  Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9537  of  October  31,  2016 

National  Native  American  Heritage  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
As  the  First  Americans,  Native  Americans  have  helped  shape  the  future 
of  the  United  States  through  every  turn  of  our  history.  Today,  young  Amer-
ican  Indians  and  Alaska  Natives  embrace  open-ended  possibility  and  are 
determining  their  own  destinies.  During  National  Native  American  Heritage 
Month,  we  pledge  to  maintain  the  meaningful  partnerships  we  have  with 
tribal nations, and we renew our commitment to our nation-to-nation relation-
ships as we seek to give all our children the future they deserve. 
Over our long shared history, there have been too many unfortunate chapters 
of  pain  and  tragedy,  discrimination  and  injustice.  We  must  acknowledge 
that  history  while  recognizing  that  the  future  is  still  ours  to  write.  That 
is  why  my  Administration  remains  dedicated  to  strengthening  our  govern-
ment-to-government relationships with tribal nations and working to improve 
the  lives  of  all  our  people.  Three  years  ago,  I  issued  an  Executive  Order 
establishing  the  White  House  Council  on  Native  American  Affairs  to  help 
ensure  the  Federal  Government  engages  in  true  and  lasting  relationships 
with tribes and promotes the development of prosperous and resilient tribal 
communities.  Last  month,  I  hosted  the  eighth  Tribal  Nations  Conference 
and  brought  tribal  leaders  together  to  identify  key  issues  we  still  face. 
We  have  worked  to  better  protect  sacred  lands  and  restored  many  acres 
of tribal homelands, as well as supported greater representation of indigenous 
peoples  before  the  United  Nations  and  called  for  further  implementation 
of  the  Declaration  of  the  Rights  of  Indigenous  Peoples.  And  we  have  taken 
steps  to  strengthen  tribal  sovereignty  in  criminal  justice  matters,  including 
through the Tribal Law and Order Act. 
Through the Affordable Care Act and permanent reauthorization of the Indian 
Health  Care  Improvement  Act,  we  empowered  more  Native  Americans  to 
access the quality health care they need to live full, healthy lives. Throughout 
their  lives,  84  percent  of  American  Indian  and  Alaska  Native  women  and 
girls  will  experience  some  form  of  violence,  and  in  2013,  I  signed  the 
reauthorization  of  the  Violence  Against  Women  Act,  which  allows  tribes 
to  prosecute  non-Native  individuals  who  commit  acts  of  domestic  violence 
in  Indian  Country.  And  through  the  North  American  Working  Group  on 
Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls, we are strengthening regional 
coordination on the rights of women and girls from indigenous communities 
across the continent. 
In  recognition  of  the  immeasurable  contributions  that  Native  Americans 
have made to our Nation, we continue to advocate for expanding opportunity 
across  Indian  Country.  We  have  supported  tribal  colleges  and  universities 
and  worked  to  return  control  of  education  to  tribal  nations—not  only  to 
prepare  Native  youth  for  the  demands  of  future  employment,  but  also  to 
promote  their  own  tribal  languages  and  cultures.  We  are  investing  in  job 
training  and  clean-energy  projects,  infrastructure,  and  high-speed  internet 
that  connects  Native  American  communities  to  the  broader  economy.  We 
are  connecting  more  young  people  and  fostering  a  national  dialogue  to 
empower the next generation of Native leaders through the Generation Indige-
nous  initiative.  Through  www.NativeOneStop.gov,  we  have  also  worked  to

improve coordination and access to Federal services throughout Indian Coun-
try. Indian Country still faces many challenges, but we have made significant 
progress  together  since  I  took  office,  and  we  must  never  give  up  on  our 
pursuit of the ever brighter future that lies ahead. 
This  month,  let  us  celebrate  the  traditions,  languages,  and  stories  of  Native 
Americans  and  ensure  their  rich  histories  and  contributions  can  thrive  with 
each  passing  generation.  Let  us  continue  to  build  on  the  advancements 
we  have  made,  because  enduring  progress  will  depend  on  our  dedication 
to  honoring  our  trust  and  treaty  responsibilities.  With  sustained  effort  and 
unwavering optimism, we can ensure a vibrant and resilient Indian Country 
filled with possibility and prosperity. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  November  2016 
as  National  Native  American  Heritage  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans 
to  commemorate  this  month  with  appropriate  programs  and  activities,  and 
to celebrate November 25, 2016, as Native American Heritage Day. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirty-first  day 
of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

Proclamation  9439  of  April  29,  2016 

National  Teacher  Appreciation  Day  and  National  Teacher 
Appreciation  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our  country’s  story,  written  over  more  than  two  centuries,  is  one  of  chal-
lenges,  chances,  and  progress.  As  our  Nation  has  advanced  on  our  journey 
toward  ensuring  rights  and  opportunities  are  extended  fully  and  equally 
to  all  people,  America’s  teachers—from  the  front  lines  of  our  civil  rights 
movement  to  the  front  lines  of  our  education  system—have  helped  steer 
our  country’s  course.  They  witness  the  incredible  potential  of  our  youth, 
and  they  know  firsthand  the  impact  of  a  caring  leader  at  the  front  of 
the classroom. 
As  our  national  narrative  has  progressed,  we  have  become  a  more  equal 
society, cleared paths to opportunity, and affirmed the extraordinary potential 
of all our people—regardless of their race, their gender, their sexual orienta-
tion,  their  religion,  or  the  zip  code  they  were  born  into.  But  there  is  still 
work  to  be  done.  If  our  country’s  story  is  going  to  reflect  the  diversity 
we  draw  strength  from,  it  needs  to  be  written  by  people  that  represent 
the wide range of backgrounds and origins that comprise our national mosaic, 
and  as  the  next  generation  rises  and  prepares  to  shape  that  narrative,  our 
teachers will be with them every step of the way—imparting critical knowl-
edge and opening their minds to the possibilities tomorrow holds. In working 
to  ensure  all  our  daughters  and  sons  have  the  chance  to  add  their  voice 
and  perspective  to  America’s  story,  our  teachers  help  shape  a  Nation  that 
better reflects the values we were founded upon. 
When  I  took  office,  I  did  so  with  a  bold  vision  to  foster  innovation  and 
drive change within our education system, and to expand educational oppor-
tunities  and  outcomes  for  all  America’s  learners.  Central  to  that  goal  is 
our  work  to  build  and  strengthen  the  teaching  profession  so  our  teachers 
are  enabled  and  equipped  to  inspire  rising  generations.  I  have  worked  hard 
throughout  my  Presidency  to  make  sure  my  Administration  does  its  part 
to  support  our  educators  and  our  education  system,  but  the  incredible 
progress  our  country  has  seen—from  achieving  record  high  graduation  rates 
to  holding  more  students  to  high  standards  that  prepare  them  for  success 
in  college  and  future  careers—is  thanks  to  the  dedicated  teachers,  families, 
and  school  leaders  who  work  tirelessly  on  behalf  of  our  young  people. 
Just as we know a student’s circumstances do not dictate his or her potential, 
we  know  that  having  an  effective  teacher  is  the  most  important  in-school 
factor  for  student  success.  That  is  why  my  Administration  has  been  com-
mitted  to  better  recruiting,  preparing,  retraining,  and  rewarding  America’s 
teachers.  Following  the  worst  economic  crisis  our  country  has  seen  since 
the  Great  Depression,  my  Administration  supported  significant  investments 
in education through the Recovery Act to keep more than 300,000 educators 
in the classroom. We have invested more than $2.7 billion through competi-
tive  grants  to  better  recruit,  train,  support,  and  reward  talented  teachers 
and  educators,  and  we  have  worked  to  make  sure  teachers  have  a  strong 
voice  and  a  seat  at  the  table  in  the  policymaking  process.  At  the  urging 
of the Department of Education, all fifty States are advancing teacher equity 
plans  to  ensure  that  districts  can  support  and  retain  educators  in  schools

that need them most. In my State of the Union address in 2011, I announced 
a  national  goal  to  prepare  100,000  public  school  STEM  teachers  by  2021 
to  help  ensure  more  of  our  young  innovators  can  seize  the  opportunities 
of  tomorrow—and  I  am  proud  that  we  are  on  track  to  meet  that  goal. 
I  recently  signed  the  bipartisan  Every  Student  Succeeds  Act  (ESSA),  which 
ensures  students  are  held  to  high  standards  that  will  better  prepare  them 
for  college  and  careers.  And  because  cookie-cutter  solutions  are  not  always 
effective  considering  the  diversity  of  our  communities  and  of  the  students 
in our classrooms, ESSA reflects my Administration’s approach to education 
reform  by  empowering  States  and  local  decision  makers,  who  know  what 
their  students  need  best,  to  shape  their  own  progress  with  accountability. 
ESSA  also  aligns  with  the  Testing  Action  Plan  I  announced  last  fall  to 
help  reduce  the  burden  of  standardized  testing  so  educators  can  spend 
less  time  testing  and  more  time  teaching.  This  law  will  also  allow  more 
States  and  districts  to  support  teachers  and  expand  access  to  computer 
science, a critical skill our students need in the innovation economy. 
Our  future  is  written  in  schools  across  our  country.  It  is  likely  that  the 
first  person  who  will  go  to  Mars  is  in  a  classroom  today.  Our  students 
are our future teachers, scientists, politicians, public servants, and parents— 
a  generation  that  will  steer  the  course  we  will  take  as  a  people  and  make 
possible  things  we  have  not  even  imagined  yet.  We  look  to  the  women 
and  men  standing  in  front  of  classrooms  in  all  corners  of  our  country— 
from  cities  to  reservations  to  rural  towns—to  vest  America’s  daughters  and 
sons  with  the  hard  skills  they  will  need  to  put  their  dreams  within  reach 
and to inspire them to dream even bigger. On National Teacher Appreciation 
Day  and  during  National  Teacher  Appreciation  Week,  let  us  ensure  our 
educators  know  how  much  we  value  their  service  in  the  classroom,  how 
much  we  appreciate  all  they  do  for  our  students  and  families,  and  how 
thankful we are for their contributions to our national progress. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  3,  2016,  as 
National  Teacher  Appreciation  Day  and  May  1  through  May  7,  2016,  as 
National  Teacher  Appreciation  Week.  I  call  upon  students,  parents,  and 
all  Americans  to  recognize  the  hard  work  and  dedication  of  our  Nation’s 
teachers  and  to  observe  this  day  and  this  week  by  supporting  teachers 
through appropriate activities, events, and programs. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  twenty-ninth 
day  of  April,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fortieth.

Proclamation  9518  of  October  7,  2016 

National  School  Lunch  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Seventy years ago, President Harry Truman signed the National School Lunch 
Act,  declaring  ‘‘Nothing  is  more  important  in  our  national  life  than  the 
welfare  of  our  children,  and  proper  nourishment  comes  first  in  attaining 
this  welfare.’’  This  Act  created  the  National  School  Lunch  Program  and 
provided  lunch  to  7  million  children  in  its  first  year—today,  more  than 
30 million children depend on it each day. As we observe the 70th anniver-
sary  of  this  program,  we  recommit  to  ensuring  access  to  proper  nutrition 
throughout the school day for all our young people so that they may pursue 
their education and chase their dreams. 
Since  the  beginning  of  my  Administration,  I  have  worked  to  build  on  the 
legacy  of  the  National  School  Lunch  Program.  In  2010,  the  Congress  passed 
and  I  signed  into  law  the  Healthy,  Hunger-Free  Kids  Act,  which  increased 
the  number  of  students  who  could  get  subsidized  or  free  school  meals 
and  improved  the  quality  of  school  meals.  For  children  from  low-income 
households,  meals  provided  by  the  National  School  Lunch  Program  and 
the  School  Breakfast  Program  may  be  their  only  reliable  source  of  nutrition 
throughout  the  day.  We  are  working  to  increase  access  for  more  children, 
including  by  using  Medicaid  data  to  automatically  connect  eligible  students 
in need to free or reduced-priced meals. 
During the school year, nearly 22 million children receive free and reduced- 
price school meals. When school is out for the summer, well over 2 million 
children  rely  on  the  Summer  Food  Service  Program  for  nourishment.  How-
ever, too many kids still lack access to adequate nutrition during the summer 
months,  which  is  why  I  proposed  investing  $12  billion  in  my  latest  budget 
to  provide  supplemental  summer  food  benefits  to  children  who  receive 
free and subsidized school meals during the academic year. 
We  must  also  work  to  give  children  greater  access  to  nutritious  foods  and 
empower  them  to  make  healthy  choices.  Too  many  young  people  are  obese 
or  overweight  and  remain  at  risk  for  health  problems  like  diabetes  or  heart 
disease  later  in  life.  First  Lady  Michelle  Obama  has  championed  efforts 
to build healthy futures for all children, particularly through the Let’s Move! 
initiative,  which  has  worked  to  provide  healthier  meals  in  our  schools 
and  ensure  every  family  has  access  to  healthy,  affordable  food.  The  Depart-
ment  of  Agriculture  updated  school  nutrition  standards  to  make  sure  all 
school  meals  and  snacks  meet  science-based  nutrition  criteria,  and  almost 
all  schools  participating  in  the  National  School  Lunch  Program  are  meeting 
these standards. 
In  order  for  our  children  to  join  the  most  prepared  and  educated  workforce 
in  the  world,  we  must  remember  the  connection  between  what  our  kids 
eat  and  how  well  they  perform  in  school.  During  National  School  Lunch 
Week,  let  us  reaffirm  our  dedication  to  helping  America’s  daughters  and 
sons  succeed  by  guaranteeing  they  have  access  to  the  healthy  meals  they 
need.  Let  us  express  our  gratitude  for  the  school  nutrition  professionals, 
educators,  and  administrators  who  are  helping  deliver  the  promise  of  a 
bright future to schoolchildren across America each day.

Proclamation  9485  of  September  1,  2016 

National  Prostate  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in Amer-
ican  men,  and  too  many  men  and  their  families  feel  the  pain  and  grief 
it  brings.  As  a  country,  we  must  do  everything  in  our  power  to  support 
men  who  are  battling  prostate  cancer,  deliver  the  care  and  treatment  they 
need,  and  defeat  this  devastating  disease.  A  cancer-free  future  is  within 
our grasp—with bold vision and daring optimism, we are pioneering medical 
breakthroughs  in  research  and  seeking  to  discover  a  cure  for  cancer  in 
our  time.  During  National  Prostate  Cancer  Awareness  Month,  we  remember 
all  the  men  who  lost  their  lives  to  this  disease,  and  resolve  to  reach  a 
tomorrow  where  prostate  cancer  is  no  longer  a  threat  to  our  sons  and 
grandsons. 
In  2016,  approximately  180,000  men  will  be  diagnosed,  and  26,000  men 
will  lose  their  battle  with  prostate  cancer.  Incredible  advancements  have 
paved the way for better prevention, detection, and treatment of this disease, 
and  over  the  past  two  decades,  the  incidence  of  new  cases  and  mortality 
rates  for  prostate  cancer  have  been  steadily  declining.  Men  who  are  African 
American,  over  the  age  of  65,  or  have  a  family  history  of  prostate  cancer 
are  at  higher  risk  and  should  be  aware  of  risk  factors  and  symptoms.  I 
encourage  all  men  to  talk  to  their  health  care  providers  about  how  prostate 
cancer  can  affect  them,  and  to  learn  more  by  visiting  www.Cancer.gov/ 
Prostate or www.CDC.gov/Cancer/Prostate. 
The  Affordable  Care  Act  has  ensured  that  more  Americans  have  access 
to quality, affordable health insurance, and it prohibits insurance companies 
from denying coverage to someone simply because they have prostate cancer. 
The  Act  eliminates  annual  and  lifetime  limits  on  coverage  and  ensures 
individuals  have  the  option  to  participate  in  clinical  trials,  which  have 
proven helpful in advancing research of new treatment strategies and improv-
ing clinical care for men with prostate cancer. 
This  year,  I  asked  Vice  President  Joe  Biden  to  lead  our  Nation  in  a  new 
effort  to  end  cancer  as  we  know  it.  The  White  House  Cancer  Moonshot 
Task  Force  is  striving  to  make  a  decade  of  advances  in  cancer  prevention, 
treatment,  and  care  in  just  5  years  through  the  collaboration  of  Federal 
agencies, jumpstarted by a proposed nearly $1 billion investment. Addition-
ally,  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  is  helping  to  introduce  a  series 
of  pilot  programs  that  will  accelerate  clinical  research  and  care  for  veterans 
with prostate cancer using cutting-edge biotechnologies—they are also work-
ing  to  increase  precision  oncology  research  and  strengthen  personalized 
medicine  for  the  treatment  of  prostate  cancer  among  veterans.  These  efforts 
build  on  the  goals  of  our  Precision  Medicine  Initiative,  which  aims  to 
deliver personalized care and apply medicine more efficiently and effectively 
based  on  genetics—and  ultimately,  to  bring  us  closer  to  curing  diseases 
like cancer. 
This  month,  let  us  thank  the  countless  researchers,  medical  professionals, 
and advocates who dedicate themselves to supporting survivors and beating 
cancer.  Let  us  continue  raising  awareness  of  prostate  cancer  and  renew 
our commitment to finding a cure once and for all.

Proclamation  9511  of  September  30,  2016 

National  Energy  Action  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  sustainability  of  our  country  and  our  world  in  the  21st  century  rests 
on  our  ability  to  address  our  shared  energy  challenges  and  to  encourage 
diverse,  clean,  and  efficient  energy  production.  During  National  Energy  Ac-
tion  Month,  we  rededicate  ourselves  to  securing  a  more  prosperous  and 
energy-independent  future.  As  climate  change  continues  to  threaten  our 
planet,  we  must  join  together  to  reduce  our  carbon  emissions,  protect  our 
environment, and leave behind a cleaner and more resilient world for genera-
tions to come. 
Today,  America  is  less  reliant  on  foreign  oil  than  at  any  point  in  the 
previous  four  decades.  To  build  on  this  progress,  we  are  implementing 
new  fuel  efficiency  standards  for  medium-  and  heavy-duty  vehicles  that 
are projected to significantly reduce diesel consumption. We are also increas-
ing  the  energy  efficiency  of  our  buildings  and  appliances  and  modernizing 
our  energy  infrastructure  as  we  experience  a  rapid  transformation  in  the 
way power is generated and used across our country. 
To ensure our energy security for generations, the United States is partnering 
with  Canada  and  Mexico  to  pursue  regional  energy  security  and  combat 
climate  change.  Earlier  this  year  at  the  North  American  Leaders  Summit, 
we  set  an  historic  goal  of  achieving  50  percent  clean  power  generation 
across  our  continent  by  2025.  These  efforts  will  bolster  a  transition  to 
clean energy sources that increase economic competitiveness and strengthen 
growing  industries  while  supporting  hundreds  of  thousands  of  new  jobs. 
Our  solar  industry  is  creating  jobs  12  times  faster  than  the  rest  of  the 
economy, and wind generation now supports tens of thousands of American 
jobs. Additionally, we are working to diversify our energy portfolio to include 
sources  of  zero  emissions  power  like  nuclear  and  hydropower;  expand  our 
supply  of  affordable,  reliable,  and  efficient  energy  sources;  and  make  it 
easier for every American to access cleaner forms of energy. 
In  response  to  the  devastating  consequences  of  our  changing  climate,  we 
are  embracing  our  responsibility  to  achieve  a  low-carbon  future.  To  do 
our  part,  we  are  on  track  to  reach  the  2020  emissions  reductions  goals 
I  set  when  I  first  took  office,  and  we  are  pursuing  even  greater  cuts  for 
2025.  Last  year,  we  joined  nearly  200  countries  for  the  announcement  of 
the  most  ambitious  climate  agreement  in  history,  and  in  September  we 
formally joined the Paris Agreement with China. As we embolden the world 
to  take  steps  that  will  dramatically  reduce  global  carbon  pollution,  we  are 
leading  by  example—our  levels  of  carbon  pollution  remain  at  historic  lows. 
We  must  continue  demonstrating  that  a  country  can  simultaneously  strive 
for a cleaner environment and a stronger economy. 
Despite  this  progress,  there  is  much  work  to  do  to  realize  the  clean  energy 
economy  of  tomorrow.  Last  year,  in  partnership  with  19  other  countries, 
we launched Mission Innovation to accelerate clean energy innovation around 
the  world.  Through  this  initiative,  20  countries  and  the  European  Union 
committed  to  seeking  to  double  public  funding  for  clean  energy  research 
and  development  to  $30  billion  over  5  years.  By  doubling  our  proposed 
Federal  investment  in  clean  energy,  we  will  enable  our  brightest  scientists,

engineers, and entrepreneurs to create and advance clean energy technologies 
that  will  protect  our  environment,  increase  our  energy  security,  and  create 
more jobs across our country. 
Although  the  difficulties  that  lie  ahead  are  large,  the  stakes  are  too  great 
for  inaction.  Our  children  and  grandchildren  are  relying  on  our  ability 
to rise to these challenges and accomplish what is required of us—including 
advancing clean, renewable, and independent sources of energy. Throughout 
National  Energy  Action  Month,  let  us  pledge  to  reduce  our  carbon  footprint 
and  minimize  our  energy  consumption.  Let  us  strive  to  continue  fighting 
for  a  cleaner,  stronger,  and  more  secure  future  for  our  fellow  Americans 
and for all of humanity. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Energy  Action  Month.  I  call  upon  the  citizens  of  the  United  States 
to  recognize  this  month  by  working  together  to  achieve  greater  energy  secu-
rity,  a  more  robust  economy,  and  a  healthier  environment  for  our  children. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirtieth  day 
of  September,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  sixteen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty-

Proclamation  9648  of  September  29,  2017 

National  Cybersecurity  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
All Americans are affected by threats to our Nation’s cybersecurity. In recent 
years,  bad  actors  in  cyberspace  have  launched  attacks  on  a  cross-section 
of  America:  businesses  both  small  and  large,  State  and  local  governments, 
schoolhouses,  hospitals,  and  infrastructure  critical  to  public  safety  and  na-
tional  security.  My  Administration  is  committed  to  protecting  Americans 
against  these  threats.  During  Cybersecurity  Awareness  Month,  we  reflect 
on  our  Nation’s  increasing  reliance  on  technology  and  the  internet  and 
raise  awareness  about  the  importance  of  cybersecurity.  Keeping  our  Nation 
secure  in  the  face  of  cyber  threats  is  our  shared  responsibility.  Our  agility 
and  resilience  in  responding  to  these  threats  will  improve  as  our  collective 
awareness about their nature improves. 
On  May  11,  2017,  I  signed  an  Executive  Order  entitled  Strengthening  the 
Cybersecurity  of  Federal  Networks  and  Critical  Infrastructure  to  counter 
the  serious  and  increasing  cyber  threats  facing  our  Nation.  My  Executive 
Order will help secure Federal networks that operate on behalf of American 
citizens, improve coordination with industry to protect the critical infrastruc-
ture that maintains our American way of life, strengthen our cyber deterrence 
posture,  and  promote  the  development  of  a  highly  capable  and  sustainable 
cybersecurity workforce. 
Together,  these  efforts  will  help  ensure  that  our  country  remains  secure 
and  safe  from  21st  century  cyber  threats,  while  keeping  the  internet  viable, 
valuable, and safe for future generations. Through my Administration’s cyber-
security  policies,  America  and  the  world  will  continue  on  a  path  toward 
a  more  open  and  secure  internet—one  that  fosters  innovation  and  spurs 
economic  prosperity.  We  will  accomplish  this  while  respecting  privacy  and 
preventing cyber disruption, fraud, and theft. 
This month in particular, I encourage public and private-sector organizations 
to  work  together  to  provide  Americans  with  the  information,  guidance,  and 
tools  they  need  to  improve  their  safety  and  security  in  the  digital  age. 
I  also  encourage  every  American  to  learn  more  about  how  to  protect  them-
selves  and  their  businesses  through  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security’s 
Stop.Think.Connect. campaign. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2017  as 
National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I call upon the people, companies, 
and institutions of the United States to recognize the importance of cybersecu-
rity  and  to  observe  this  month  through  events,  training,  and  education 
to further our country’s national security and resilience.

Proclamation  9600  of  April  28,  2017 

National  Charter  Schools  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Charter  Schools  Week,  we  recommit  ourselves  to  empow-
ering students and giving parents their rightful freedom over their children’s 
education.  We  recognize  the  successful  public  charter  schools  across  the 
country  and  the  families,  teachers,  administrators,  and  communities  who 
continue  to  invest  in  our  Nation’s  most  precious  resource—our  children. 
More  than  25  years  ago,  an  idea  took  root:  educators  free  of  restrictive 
processes  and  policies,  and  empowered  to  experiment  with  new  teaching 
methods,  would  generate  better  outcomes  for  students.  Charter  schools  are 
built  around  this  idea.  Like  traditional  public  schools,  they  are  tuition- 
free,  but  they  operate  independently  from  traditional  school  boards  and, 
in  exchange,  are  held  accountable  by  local  authorizers  to  standards  that 
are often more demanding. 
Education is the foundation for success, and educational opportunity should 
not  be  limited  or  defined  by  status,  income,  or  residence.  All  children 
deserve  access  to  a  quality  education.  When  our  children  receive  a  rigorous 
education  and  are  held  to  high  standards,  they  can  achieve  their  goals, 
rise out of poverty, and actively engage in our democracy. 
For  too  long,  however,  students  across  this  country  have  been  trapped  in 
failing  or  underperforming  schools  simply  because  of  their  zip  code.  The 
Washington  one-size-fits-all  approach  has  not  worked  for  far  too  many  of 
our  children.  Fortunately,  we  have  seen  how  allowing  families  the  freedom 
to  choose  other  schooling  options—including  charter  schools—delivers  life- 
changing results. 
Today,  44  States  and  the  District  of  Columbia  have  laws  that  allow  for 
charter  schools,  which  enroll  more  than  3  million  students.  The  demand 
for  charter  schools  only  continues  to  grow:  a  recent  study  showed  that 
at least 70 percent of parents favor opening a charter school in their neighbor-
hood.  This  is  because  charter  schools  work.  According  to  Stanford  Univer-
sity’s  Center  for  Research  on  Education  Outcomes  study,  students  in  urban 
charter  schools,  on  average,  achieve  significantly  greater  outcomes  in  both 
reading  and  math.  This  is  why  I  have  called  upon  the  Congress  to  increase 
funding  for  charter  schools  as  well  as  school  choice  programs  for  disadvan-
taged youth, which would include millions of African American and Latino 
children.  Under  the  leadership  of  Secretary  of  Education  Betsy  DeVos,  we 
will expand charter school options for students throughout the United States. 
As  Americans,  we  have  an  abiding  conviction  that  our  next  generation’s 
future  should  be  even  brighter  than  ours.  Education  provides  the  staircase 
out  of  poverty,  toward  a  fulfilling  life  of  work  and  service,  and  a  true 
shot  at  the  American  Dream.  We  want  every  student—from  New  Orleans 
to Kansas City, from Houston to Detroit, and every city and town in between— 
to rise to success. Charter schools have tremendous potential to offer students 
around  the  country  the  priceless  gift  of  possibility.  As  a  Nation,  we  should 
support  the  continued  success  of  charter  schools  and  hold  our  students 
up to the high standards they are all capable of achieving.

Title  3— 

The  President 

Presidential Documents

8657 

Executive  Order  13766  of  January  24,  2017 

Expediting  Environmental  Reviews  and  Approvals  for  High 
Priority  Infrastructure  Projects 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct as follows: 
Section 1. Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic plat-
form,  makes  America  more  competitive,  creates  millions  of  jobs,  increases 
wages  for  American  workers,  and  reduces  the  costs  of  goods  and  services 
for  American  families  and  consumers.  Too  often,  infrastructure  projects  in 
the  United  States  have  been  routinely  and  excessively  delayed  by  agency 
processes  and  procedures.  These  delays  have  increased  project  costs  and 
blocked the American people from the full benefits of increased infrastructure 
investments,  which  are  important  to  allowing  Americans  to  compete  and 
win  on  the  world  economic  stage.  Federal  infrastructure  decisions  should 
be  accomplished  with  maximum  efficiency  and  effectiveness,  while  also 
respecting property rights and protecting public safety and the environment. 
To  that  end,  it  is  the  policy  of  the  executive  branch  to  streamline  and 
expedite,  in  a  manner  consistent  with  law,  environmental  reviews  and  ap-
provals  for  all  infrastructure  projects,  especially  projects  that  are  a  high 
priority  for  the  Nation,  such  as  improving  the  U.S.  electric  grid  and  tele-
communications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, 
airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways. 
Sec.  2.  Identification  of  High  Priority  Infrastructure  Projects.  With  respect 
to  infrastructure  projects  for  which  Federal  reviews  and  approvals  are  re-
quired, upon request by the Governor of a State, or the head of any executive 
department or agency (agency), or on his or her own initiative, the Chairman 
of  the  White  House  Council  on  Environmental  Quality  (CEQ)  shall,  within 
30  days  after  a  request  is  made,  decide  whether  an  infrastructure  project 
qualifies as a ‘‘high priority’’ infrastructure project. This determination shall 
be made after consideration of the project’s importance to the general welfare, 
value  to  the  Nation,  environmental  benefits,  and  such  other  factors  as  the 
Chairman deems relevant. 
Sec.  3.  Deadlines.  With  respect  to  any  project  designated  as  a  high  priority 
under  section  2  of  this  order,  the  Chairman  of  the  CEQ  shall  coordinate 
with  the  head  of  the  relevant  agency  to  establish,  in  a  manner  consistent 
with  law,  expedited  procedures  and  deadlines  for  completion  of  environ-
mental  reviews  and  approvals  for  such  projects.  All  agencies  shall  give 
highest priority to completing such reviews and approvals by the established 
deadlines  using  all  necessary  and  appropriate  means.  With  respect  to  dead-
lines  established  consistent  with  this  section  that  are  not  met,  the  head 
of  the  relevant  agency  shall  provide  a  written  explanation  to  the  Chairman 
explaining  the  causes  for  the  delay  and  providing  concrete  actions  taken 
by  the  agency  to  complete  such  reviews  and  approvals  as  expeditiously 
as possible. 
Sec.  4.  General  Provisions.  (a)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent 
with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(b)  Nothing  in  this  order  shall  be  construed  to  impair  or  otherwise  affect: 
(i)  the  authority  granted  by  law  to  an  executive  department  or  agency 
or the head thereof; or

Executive  Order  13761  of  January  13,  2017 

Recognizing  Positive  Actions  by  the  Government  of  Sudan 
and  Providing  for  the  Revocation  of  Certain  Sudan-Related 
Sanctions 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency 
Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1701  et  seq.),  the  National  Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhance-
ment  Act  of  2000  (22  U.S.C.  7201–7211)  (TSRA),  the  Comprehensive  Peace 
in Sudan Act of 2004, as amended (Public Law 108–497) (CPSA), the Darfur 
Peace  and  Accountability  Act  of  2006  (Public  Law  109–344)  (DPAA),  and 
section 301 of title 3, United States Code, 

I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States  of  America,  find  that 
the  situation  that  gave  rise  to  the  actions  taken  in  Executive  Order  13067 
of  November  3,  1997,  and  Executive  Order  13412  of  October  13,  2006, 
related  to  the  policies  and  actions  of  the  Government  of  Sudan  has  been 
altered  by  Sudan’s  positive  actions  over  the  past  6  months.  These  actions 
include  a  marked  reduction  in  offensive  military  activity,  culminating  in 
a  pledge  to  maintain  a  cessation  of  hostilities  in  conflict  areas  in  Sudan, 
and steps toward the improvement of humanitarian access throughout Sudan, 
as well as cooperation with the United States on addressing regional conflicts 
and  the  threat  of  terrorism.  Given  these  developments,  and  in  order  to 
see  these  efforts  sustained  and  enhanced  by  the  Government  of  Sudan, 
I hereby order: 

Section  1.  Effective  July  12,  2017  and  provided  the  criteria  in  section  12(b) 
of this order are met, sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order 13067 of November 
3,  1997,  are  revoked,  and  Executive  Order  13412  of  October  13,  2006,  is 
revoked  in  its  entirety.  The  revocation  of  those  provisions  of  Executive 
Order  13067  and  of  Executive  Order  13412  shall  not  affect  any  violation 
of  any  rules,  regulations,  orders,  licenses,  or  other  forms  of  administrative 
action  under  those  orders  during  the  period  that  those  provisions  were 
in effect. 

Sec.  2.  Pursuant  to  section  908(a)(3)  of  TSRA,  I  hereby  determine  that 
it  is  in  the  national  security  interest  of  the  United  States  to  waive,  and 
hereby  waive,  the  application  of  section  908(a)(1)  of  TSRA  with  respect 
to Sudan. 

Sec.  3.  Pursuant  to  section  6(d)  of  CPSA,  I  hereby  determine  and  certify 
that  it  is  in  the  national  interest  of  the  United  States  to  waive,  and  hereby 
waive, the application of sections 6(a) and (b) of CPSA. 

Sec.  4.  The  function  of  the  President  under  section  6(c)(1)  of  CPSA  is 
assigned to the Secretary of the Treasury. 

Sec.  5.  The  functions  of  the  President  under  section  6(c)(2)  and  the  last 
sentence  of  section  6(d)  of  CPSA  are  assigned  to  the  Secretary  of  State, 
except  that  the  function  of  denial  of  entry  is  assigned  to  the  Secretary 
of Homeland Security. 

Sec.  6.  The  function  of  the  President  under  section  8  of  DPAA  is  assigned 
to the Secretary of State.

Proclamation  9585  of  March  31,  2017 

National  Sexual  Assault  Awareness  and  Prevention  Month, 
2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

At  the  heart  of  our  country  is  the  emphatic  belief  that  every  person  has 
unique  and  infinite  value.  We  dedicate  each  April  to  raising  awareness 
about  sexual  abuse  and  recommitting  ourselves  to  fighting  it.  Women,  chil-
dren, and men have inherent dignity that should never be violated. 

According  to  the  Department  of  Justice,  on  average  there  are  more  than 
300,000  instances  of  rape  or  other  sexual  assault  that  afflict  our  neighbors 
and  loved  ones  every  year.  Behind  these  painful  statistics  are  real  people 
whose  lives  are  profoundly  affected,  at  times  shattered,  and  who  are  invari-
ably in need of our help, commitment, and protection. 

As we recognize National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, 
we are reminded that we all share the responsibility to reduce and ultimately 
end  sexual  violence.  As  a  Nation,  we  must  develop  meaningful  strategies 
to  eliminate  these  crimes,  including  increasing  awareness  of  the  problem 
in  our  communities,  creating  systems  that  protect  vulnerable  groups,  and 
sharing successful prevention strategies. 

My Administration, including the Department of Justice and the Department 
of  Health  and  Human  Services,  will  do  everything  in  its  power  to  protect 
women,  children,  and  men  from  sexual  violence.  This  includes  supporting 
victims, preventing future abuse, and prosecuting offenders to the full extent 
of  the  law.  I  have  already  directed  the  Attorney  General  to  create  a  task 
force  on  crime  reduction  and  public  safety.  This  task  force  will  develop 
strategies to reduce crime and propose new legislation to fill gaps in existing 
laws. 

Prevention means reducing the prevalence of sexual violence on our streets, 
in  our  homes,  and  in  our  schools  and  institutions.  Recent  research  has 
demonstrated the effectiveness of changing social norms that accept or allow 
indifference to sexual violence. This can be done by engaging young people 
to  step  in  and  provide  peer  leadership  against  condoning  violence,  and 
by  mobilizing  men  and  boys  as  allies  in  preventing  sexual  and  relationship 
violence.  Our  families,  schools,  and  communities  must  encourage  respect 
for  women  and  children,  who  are  the  vast  majority  of  victims,  and  promote 
healthy  personal  relationships.  We  must  never  give  up  the  fight  against 
the  scourge  of  child  pornography  and  its  pernicious  effects  on  both  direct 
victims  and  the  broader  culture.  We  recommit  ourselves  this  month  to 
establishing  a  culture  of  respect  and  appreciation  for  the  dignity  of  every 
human being. 

There  is  tremendous  work  to  be  done.  Together,  we  can  and  must  protect 
our  loved  ones,  families,  campuses,  and  communities  from  the  devastating 
and  pervasive  effects  of  sexual  assault.  In  the  face  of  sexual  violence,  we 
must  commit  to  providing  meaningful  support  and  services  for  victims  and 
survivors in the United States and around the world.

Proclamation  9449  of  May  13,  2016 

World  Trade  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  United  States  of  America  cannot  afford  to  sit  on  the  sidelines  of  the 
global  economy.  With  over  95  percent  of  our  Nation’s  potential  customers 
living  outside  our  borders,  trade  agreements  are  a  vital  part  of  our  agenda 
for  creating  jobs  and  growing  our  economy—and  smart  trade  agreements 
that  level  the  playing  field  for  American  workers  and  businesses  are  a 
vital piece of middle-class economics. During World Trade Week, we reaffirm 
the  importance  of  global  trade,  and  we  redouble  our  efforts  to  pursue  trade 
deals that reflect American values and give our people a fair shot at success. 
America’s  small  businesses  employ  more  than  half  of  all  Americans,  and 
they  represent  98  percent  of  our  Nation’s  exporters.  I  am  committed  to 
a trade agenda that includes strong, enforceable provisions in our agreements 
that  help  our  businesses—large  and  small—support  higher-paying  jobs  and 
ship products stamped ‘‘Made in the USA’’ around the world. My Administra-
tion  has  ramped  up  enforcement  of  our  trade  laws  like  never  before.  Last 
year,  I  renewed  and  expanded  the  Trade  Adjustment  Assistance  program, 
providing job training and other assistance to American workers. And earlier 
this  year,  I  signed  bipartisan  legislation  that  helps  us  enforce  our  trade 
agreements—helping ensure that other countries play by the rules. 
Some  of  our  greatest  economic  opportunities  abroad  are  in  the  Asia-Pacific 
region.  For  more  than  5  years,  the  United  States  negotiated  a  new,  forward- 
looking  trade  deal  that  puts  workers  first  and  ensures  we  write  the  rules 
of  the  road  for  trade  in  the  21st  century.  The  Trans-Pacific  Partnership 
(TPP)  brings  12  countries  representing  nearly  40  percent  of  the  global  econ-
omy  together  to  trade  and  invest  in  the  Asia-Pacific—one  of  the  world’s 
fastest  growing  regions.  The  TPP  includes  fully  enforceable  provisions  that 
ensure  a  free  and  open  Internet,  respect  intellectual  property  rights,  protect 
the  environment,  and  uphold  worker  rights.  It  eliminates  more  than  18,000 
taxes  imposed  by  other  countries  on  American  products,  and  it  bolsters 
our leadership abroad while supporting good jobs here at home. The United 
States  signed  TPP  this  year,  and  I  will  continue  working  with  the  Congress 
to enact it as soon as possible. 
The  largest  trade  and  investment  relationship  in  the  world  is  between  the 
United  States  and  the  European  Union—yet  too  many  barriers  remain  in 
the  way  of  even  greater  trade  and  investment  between  us.  That  is  why, 
together,  we  have  moved  forward  with  the  Trans-Atlantic  Trade  and  Invest-
ment  Partnership  (T–TIP),  which  will  eliminate  tariffs,  simplify  procedures, 
bridge  differences  in  regulations,  and  cut  red  tape.  T–TIP  also  enforces 
strong standards, and it will reinforce our larger trans-Atlantic relationship— 
the foundation of our prosperity and security since World War II. 
Our global economy’s growth is fueled by trade. While understandable skep-
ticism  exists  about  trade,  particularly  in  places  that  have  been  hit  hard 
by trade deals of the past, we cannot ignore the realities of the new economy. 
Rather,  we  must  set  the  highest  standards  for  our  trade  agreements,  enforce 
the  commitments  and  obligations  of  our  trading  partners,  and  help  write 
the  rules  of  the  road  for  trade  in  the  21st-century  global  economy,  as  we 
have  done  with  TPP  and  will  do  through  T–TIP.  And  we  must  continue

Proclamation  9436  of  April  29,  2016 

Older  Americans  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Through  a  lifetime  of  contribution,  older  Americans  have  helped  ensure 
that  the  founding  promise  of  our  country  remains  within  reach  for  their 
children  and  grandchildren,  and  their  individual  narratives  reflect  the  ex-
traordinary  history  of  our  Nation.  This  month,  we  celebrate  our  Nation’s 
older  citizens,  and  we  show  our  appreciation  for  all  they  have  done  to 
enrich our communities and drive America forward. 
Older  Americans  have  unique  knowledge  and  a  breadth  of  insights  that 
are  tremendous  assets  to  our  country—and  our  seniors  are  eager  to  impart 
the wisdom learned from their experiences. Across our country, older Ameri-
cans  work  and  volunteer  in  their  communities,  challenging  younger  Ameri-
cans’  ambitions  for  what  they  can  hope  to  achieve  in  their  golden  years. 
We  must  maximize  the  contributions  of  our  seniors  and  ensure  they  have 
the  resources  and  support  they  need  to  thrive  and  to  keep  shaping  the 
future of the country they love. 
The  population  of  the  United  States  is  transforming  rapidly.  Within  the 
next  13  years,  more  than  one  in  five  Americans  will  be  of  retirement  age, 
and  our  Nation  must  make  it  a  priority  to  ensure  they  are  able  to  retire 
and  live  with  dignity  and  respect.  I  remain  committed  to  strengthening 
Medicare  and  Social  Security—hallmark  programs  that  enabled  an  entire 
generation  of  older  Americans  to  live  with  stability  and  security.  Aging 
affects  us  all,  and  I  am  dedicated  to  empowering  more  of  today’s  seniors 
and  future  seniors.  In  2014,  I  launched  myRA,  a  new  type  of  savings  bond 
that  allows  more  of  our  people  to  save  for  retirement.  And  earlier  this 
year,  I  was  proud  to  sign  a  reauthorization  of  the  Older  Americans  Act— 
providing  critical  support  for  the  services  seniors  depend  on  to  maintain 
their health and independence. 
Our  country  has  an  obligation  to  make  sure  older  Americans  can  enjoy 
the opportunities that come with aging, and my Administration is committed 
to supporting our seniors. Last summer, we held the White House Conference 
on Aging, where we announced our plans to modernize Federal rules affecting 
older  Americans,  improve  access  to  workplace-based  retirement  plans,  and 
better utilize technology to enrich the lives of older Americans. We launched 
www.Aging.gov—a resource for government-wide information for older adults 
to  lead  independent  and  fulfilling  lives.  And  we  have  proposed  updating 
quality  and  safety  requirements  for  thousands  of  nursing  homes,  making 
it easier for homebound individuals to get nutritional assistance, and training 
more prosecutors to combat elder abuse. 
One  of  the  best  measures  of  a  country  is  how  it  treats  its  older  citizens. 
During  Older  Americans  Month,  let  us  pay  tribute  to  the  men  and  women 
who raised, guided, and inspired us, and let us honor their enduring contribu-
tions  to  our  society  by  safeguarding  their  rights  and  the  opportunities  they 
deserve. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  2016  as  Older

Proclamation  9482  of  August  31,  2016 

National  Wilderness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
In  our  Nation’s  earliest  days,  a  vast  majority  of  North  America  was  wilder-
ness—from  majestic  plains  and  imposing  mountain  ranges  to  dense  forests 
and  rushing  waterways.  Today,  protected  wild  spaces  continue  to  serve 
as  a  backdrop  for  curious  and  adventurous  Americans  to  seek  the  thrill 
and  joy  of  connecting  with  the  sacred  spirit  of  our  country’s  wilderness, 
offering a wide variety of activities including hiking, camping, and climbing. 
This  month,  as  we  cherish  our  vast  and  vibrant  natural  heritage,  we  resolve 
to preserve its splendors for all who will follow in our footsteps. 
Aiming  to  leave  future  generations  with  a  ‘‘glimpse  of  the  world  as  it 
was  in  the  beginning,’’  President  Lyndon  B.  Johnson  signed  into  law  two 
historic pieces of legislation that opened a new chapter in American conserva-
tion—the  Wilderness  Act  and  the  Land  and  Water  Conservation  Fund  Act. 
The  Wilderness  Act  defined  our  untrammeled  lands  as  wilderness  and  cre-
ated the National Wilderness Preservation System, recognizing forests, parks, 
and wildlife refuges as having intrinsic value as wild lands worth protecting. 
The  Land  and  Water  Conservation  Fund  (LWCF)  was  established  out  of 
a  bipartisan  commitment  to  ensure  that  we  can  protect  lands  and  waters 
for  use  and  enjoyment  by  all  our  people;  throughout  the  last  50  years 
it  has  supported  conservation  efforts  in  every  State,  including  tens  of  thou-
sands  of  State  and  local  projects  through  billions  of  dollars  in  grants.  But 
a  lack  of  full  and  secure  funding  hinders  many  important  LWCF  projects 
that  protect  critical  habitats  and  provide  recreational  opportunities—which 
is  why  I  keep  calling  on  the  Congress  to  pursue  permanent  funding  for 
the LWCF. 
Our  great  outdoors  are  home  to  some  of  the  richest  and  most  beautiful 
ecosystems  and  resources  on  the  planet,  and  my  Administration  has  made 
protecting  them  a  priority.  Climate  change,  one  of  the  greatest  challenges 
of  our  time,  is  already  harming  many  of  our  wild  spaces,  which  is  one 
important  reason  why  I  have  pushed  for  stronger  action  to  cut  greenhouse 
gas  pollution  and  strengthen  the  resilience  of  our  ecosystems  to  rising  tem-
peratures.  In  my  first  year  in  office,  I  signed  the  most  extensive  expansion 
of conservation efforts in more than a generation. Since then, my Administra-
tion  has  protected  hundreds  of  millions  of  acres  of  land  and  water,  more 
than  any  Administration  in  history.  Through  our  America’s  Great  Outdoors 
initiative,  we  have  worked  with  local,  State,  and  tribal  partners  to  build 
a  conservation  agenda  worthy  of  the  21st  century.  And  to  ensure  more 
Americans  can  experience  everything  the  wilderness  has  to  offer,  we 
launched  the  ‘‘Every  Kid  in  a  Park’’  initiative,  giving  fourth  graders  and 
their  families  free  entrance  to  our  National  Parks  and  other  public  lands 
and waters. 
It is one of our greatest responsibilities as citizens of this Nation and stewards 
of  this  planet  to  protect  these  outdoor  spaces  of  incomparable  beauty  and 
to  ensure  that  this  powerful  inheritance  is  passed  on  to  future  generations. 
During  National  Wilderness  Month,  let  us  strengthen  our  connection  with 
these natural treasures and ensure that the stories they tell and the resources 
they provide are resilient and everlasting in the years to come.

National  Youth  Justice  Awareness  Month,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

The  essential  promise  that  we  make  to  our  young  people—that  where  they 
start must not determine how far they can go—is part of what makes America 
exceptional.  It  is  our  shared  responsibility  to  ensure  all  children  are  given 
a  fair  shot  at  life,  including  a  quality  education  and  equal  opportunities 
to pursue their dreams. Too often in America, young people are not afforded 
a  second  chance  after  having  made  a  mistake  or  poor  decision—the  kind 
of  chance  some  of  their  peers  receive  under  more  forgiving  environments. 
Many  of  these  young  people  lack  institutional  or  family  support  and  live 
in distressed communities. Others may have experienced trauma and violence 
or  may  struggle  with  disabilities,  mental  health  issues,  or  substance  use 
disorders.  As  a  society,  we  must  strive  to  reach  these  children  earlier  in 
life  and  modernize  our  juvenile  and  criminal  justice  systems  to  hold  youth 
accountable for their actions without consigning them to a life on the margins. 
During  National  Youth  Justice  Awareness  Month,  we  reaffirm  our  commit-
ment to helping children of every background become successful and engaged 
citizens. 

While  the  number  of  juvenile  arrests  have  fallen  sharply  over  the  past 
decade,  roughly  1  million  juvenile  arrests  were  made  in  2014.  An  over-
whelming  majority  of  these  arrests  were  for  non-violent  crimes,  and  nearly 
three-quarters  of  those  arrested  were  male.  Children  of  color,  particularly 
black  and  Hispanic  males  and  Native  American  youth,  continue  to  be  over-
represented  across  all  levels  of  the  juvenile  justice  system.  Unfortunately, 
far  too  many  youth  become  involved  with  the  adult  criminal  justice  system 
each  year—including  in  several  States  where  17-year-olds  are  prosecuted 
as  adults  regardless  of  their  crime,  and  two  where  16-year-olds  are  as  well. 
Children  in  the  adult  system  have  less  access  to  rehabilitative  services 
and often face higher recidivism and suicide rates. Some States have recently 
raised  the  age  so  that  16-  and  17-year-olds  are  not  unnecessarily  tried  in 
adult courts, and many are reforming sentencing laws and expanding access 
to age-appropriate transition services upon reentry. 

Even  for  those  youth  who  were  never  convicted  or  otherwise  found  guilty, 
simply  having  had  contact  with  our  justice  system  can  lead  to  lifelong 
barriers and an increased likelihood of ending up in a cycle of incarceration. 
To help break this cycle, my Administration increased funding for expunging 
juvenile  records  and  took  steps  to  ensure  young  people  in  juvenile  and 
adult  justice  facilities  can  receive  Pell  Grants  to  pursue  a  quality  education. 
The  White  House  launched  the  Fair  Chance  Pledge  to  highlight  employers 
and institutions of higher education that have committed to reducing barriers 
that  justice-involved  youth  often  face  in  accessing  employment,  training, 
and  education.  To  build  on  these  efforts,  the  Congress  must  reauthorize 
the  Juvenile  Justice  and  Delinquency  Prevention  Act  (JJDPA)  to  increase 
protections  for  youth  and  limit  the  number  of  minors  held  in  adult  jails 
and prisons. Reauthorizing the JJDPA will promote evidence-based practices, 
quality  education,  and  trauma-informed  care  for  incarcerated  youth,  while 
reducing punishments for things such as breaking curfew and truancy.

Federal  Register / Vol.  81,  No.  194 / Thursday,  October  6,  2016 / Presidential  Documents 

We  have  also  seen  too  many  of  our  youth  held  in  solitary  confinement 
while  incarcerated,  which  can  lead  to  devastating,  long-term  psychological 
consequences.  Earlier  this  year,  my  Administration  took  steps  to  implement 
reforms  that  include  banning  this  harmful  practice  for  juveniles  under  the 
custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. We must ensure that young people 
have  quality  legal  representation  throughout  every  stage  of  the  legal  process 
as  well  as  age-appropriate  and  rehabilitative  sentencing  and  placements. 
The  financial  costs  of  the  juvenile  court  system  can  be  debilitating  and 
can  unfairly  penalize  children  from  poor  families—by  reducing  the  fees 
and  fines  imposed  on  youth,  we  can  avoid  pushing  families  into  debt  and 
decrease this disproportionate burden. 
To  meet  these  goals,  we  must  engage  young  people  before  they  find  them-
selves  locked  into  a  path  from  which  they  cannot  escape.  The  Departments 
of  Justice  and  Education  created  the  Supportive  School  Discipline  Initiative 
to  incentivize  positive  school  climates  and  rethink  discipline  policies  to 
foster safer and more supportive learning environments. They are also work-
ing  to  assist  States,  schools,  and  law  enforcement  partners  in  assessing 
the  proper  role  of  school  resource  officers  and  campus  law  enforcement 
professionals.  The  Departments  of  Justice  and  Health  and  Human  Services 
released a joint policy statement against the use of suspension and expulsion 
in  preschool  settings—which  disproportionately  affect  children  of  color.  As 
part  of  the  Office  of  Juvenile  Justice  and  Delinquency  Prevention’s  Smart 
on  Juvenile  Justice  initiative,  we  are  providing  services  such  as  job  training 
and  substance  use  disorder  treatment  and  counseling  for  youth  in  juvenile 
facilities,  and  we  are  expanding  the  use  of  effective  community-based  alter-
natives  to  youth  detention.  We  are  also  screening  youth  for  exposure  to 
trauma  that  can  put  them  at  greater  risk  of  entering  the  juvenile  justice 
system.  And  through  the  My  Brother’s  Keeper  initiative,  we  are  working 
to  address  persistent  opportunity  gaps  and  ensure  all  young  people  can 
reach  their  full  potential—including  by  helping  them  get  a  healthy  start 
in  life,  enter  school  ready  to  learn,  and  successfully  enter  the  workforce. 
When  we  invest  in  our  children  and  redirect  young  people  who  have  made 
misguided  decisions,  we  can  reduce  our  over-reliance  on  the  juvenile  and 
criminal  justice  systems  and  build  stronger  pathways  to  opportunity.  In 
addition, for every dollar we put into high-quality early childhood education, 
we  save  at  least  twice  that  down  the  road  in  reduced  crime.  That  is  why 
my  Administration  has  sought  to  expand  high-quality  early  education  by 
increasing  funding  for  programs  like  Head  Start  and  investing  in  preschool, 
child  care,  and  evidence-based  home  visiting.  Investing  in  our  communities 
and  our  kids  makes  sense,  and  if  we  recognize  that  every  child  deserves 
to  remain  connected  to  their  families  and  communities,  we  can  ensure 
youth  who  come  in  contact  with  the  law  can  have  a  chance  at  a  brighter 
future. 
This  month,  we  come  together  to  ensure  all  young  people  are  supported, 
nurtured,  and  provided  an  opportunity  to  succeed.  We  must  make  sure 
youth  in  every  community  and  from  every  walk  of  life  can  be  known 
for  more  than  their  worst  mistakes.  With  enhanced  possibilities,  a  sense 
of  optimism,  and  an  open  mind,  they  can  all  thrive  and  live  up  to  the 
full measure of their promise. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2016  as 
National  Youth  Justice  Awareness  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to 
observe this month by taking action to support our youth and by participating 
in  appropriate  ceremonies,  activities,  and  programs  in  their  communities.

Proclamation  9646  of  September  28,  2017 

National  Disability  Employment  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  National  Disability  Employment  Awareness  Month,  we  celebrate  the 
many  contributions  of  American  workers  with  disabilities  and  reaffirm  our 
admiration of the skills and talents they bring to today’s workplace. 
Every American who is willing and able to work should have the opportunity 
to  provide  for  themselves  and  their  families.  This  includes  the  30  million 
American adults with disabilities. Many Americans with disabilities struggle 
to  find  employment  opportunities,  despite  the  wealth  of  skills  they  have 
to offer. In 2016, only 27.7 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities 
were  employed.  More  employers  should  recognize  the  fresh  perspectives 
and skills these men and women can add to an innovation-focused workforce. 
They  are  an  incredible  asset  to  our  economy.  Our  goal  is  to  help  ensure 
that  they  experience  the  independence,  economic  self-sufficiency,  pride, 
and community that come with a job. 
Creating  and  maintaining  a  strong  and  robust  American  workforce  is  one 
of my Administration’s top priorities. We will ensure that people who want 
to  work  have  the  support  they  need  to  remain  on  the  job.  Employees, 
along  with  their  employers,  their  families,  and  the  economy  all  suffer  when 
they  are  forced  to  leave  the  labor  force  due  to  illness  or  accident.  We 
must  be  able  to  act  quickly  to  support  these  workers  in  their  time  of 
need. I, therefore, have directed the Department of Labor, the Social Security 
Administration,  and  other  Federal  agencies  to  identify  effective  strategies 
to help people stay at work or return to work, focusing on early intervention 
with  Americans  recently  rendered  disabled  due  to  injury  or  a  health  condi-
tion. 
We  are  committed  to  giving  all  Americans  opportunities  to  gain  the  skills 
they  need  to  fill  the  jobs  of  the  21st  century.  We  know  that  includes 
Americans  with  disabilities,  who  want  to  work,  provide  for  themselves 
and their families, contribute to their communities, and build up our Nation. 
We  will  stand  alongside  them  to  help  turn  their  American  Dreams  into 
reality. 
The  Congress,  by  Joint  Resolution  approved  August  11,  1945,  as  amended 
(36  U.S.C.  121),  has  designated  October  of  each  year  as  ‘‘National  Disability 
Employment Awareness Month.’’ 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of America, do hereby proclaim October 2017 as National Disability Employ-
ment Awareness Month. I call upon government and labor leaders, employers, 
and  the  great  people  of  the  United  States  to  recognize  the  month  with 
appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities across our land.

Proclamation  9597  of  April  28,  2017 

National  Foster  Care  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
During  the  month  of  May,  we  observe  National  Foster  Care  Month  and 
we celebrate those who have opened their homes and their hearts to children 
in  need  and  those  who  have  devoted  their  careers  to  serving  America’s 
foster youth. 
Americans  throughout  the  country  are  serving  their  communities  as  foster 
parents,  mentors,  respite  care  providers,  and  volunteers.  In  the  last  year 
alone,  America’s  foster  families  opened  their  homes  and  hearts  to  more 
than 300,000 young people. 
But  we  can  do  more.  Every  child  deserves  a  safe  and  supportive  family. 
Ensuring  that  children  grow  up  with  the  opportunity  to  reach  their  full 
potential  is  a  top  priority  of  my  Administration.  For  thousands  of  children 
whose biological families are unable to support them, foster families provide 
a  secure  and  nurturing  environment  that  is  essential  for  a  successful  start 
in life. 
Foster  families  serve  young  people  from  all  walks  of  life,  from  infants 
awaiting  adoption,  to  children  seeking  reunification  with  their  families  and 
teens  in  need  of  safe  havens  from  negative  influences.  In  many  cases,  they 
offer  our  Nation’s  most  at-risk  children  a  second  chance  at  the  American 
Dream. 
A  tremendous  demand  exists  for  foster  parents  and  families  across  the 
country.  Together  as  a  Nation,  we  must  raise  awareness  about  this  need 
and inspire volunteers to step forward and invest in the lives of our Nation’s 
youth through our foster care system. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Donald  J.  Trump,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017 as National 
Foster  Care  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  observe  this  month  by 
taking  time  to  help  children  and  youth  in  foster  care  and  to  recognize 
the  commitment  of  those  who  touch  their  lives,  particularly  celebrating 
their foster parents and other caregivers.

Memorandum  of  January  24,  2017 

Construction  of  the  Keystone  XL  Pipeline 

Memorandum  for  the  Secretary  of  State[,]  the  Secretary  of  the  Army[, 
and]  the  Secretary  of  the  Interior 

Section  1.  Policy.  In  accordance  with  Executive  Order  11423  of  August 
16,  1968,  as  amended,  and  Executive  Order  13337  of  April  30,  2004,  the 
Secretary  of  State  has  delegated  authority  to  receive  applications  for  Presi-
dential  permits  for  the  construction,  connection,  operation,  or  maintenance, 
at the borders of the United States, of facilities for the exportation or importa-
tion  of  petroleum,  petroleum  products,  coal,  or  other  fuels  to  or  from  a 
foreign  country,  and  to  issue  or  deny  such  Presidential  permits.  As  set 
forth  in  those  Executive  Orders,  the  Secretary  of  State  should  issue  a  Presi-
dential  permit  for  any  cross-border  pipeline  project  that  ‘‘would  serve  the 
national interest.’’ 
Accordingly,  pursuant  to  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the 
Constitution  and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct 
as follows: 
Sec.  2.  Invitation  to  Submit  an  Application.  I  hereby  invite  TransCanada 
Keystone Pipeline, L.P. (TransCanada), to promptly re-submit its application 
to  the  Department  of  State  for  a  Presidential  permit  for  the  construction 
and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline, a major pipeline for the importa-
tion of petroleum from Canada to the United States. 
Sec.  3.  Directives.  (a)  Department  of  State.  The  Secretary  of  State  shall, 
if the application referred to in section 2 is submitted, receive the application 
and  take  all  actions  necessary  and  appropriate  to  facilitate  its  expeditious 
review. With respect to that review, I hereby direct as follows: 

(i)  The  Secretary  of  State  shall  reach  a  final  permitting  determination, 
including  a  final  decision  as  to  any  conditions  on  issuance  of  the  permit 
that  are  necessary  or  appropriate  to  serve  the  national  interest,  within 
60 days of TransCanada’s submission of the permit application. 
(ii)  To  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law,  the  Final  Supplemental 
Environmental  Impact  Statement  issued  by  the  Department  of  State  in 
January  2014  regarding  the  Keystone  XL  Pipeline  (Final  Supplemental 
EIS)  and  the  environmental  analysis,  consultation,  and  review  described 
in  that  document  (including  appendices)  shall  be  considered  by  the  Sec-
retary  of  State  to  satisfy  the  following  with  respect  to  the  Keystone  XL 
Pipeline  as  described  in  TransCanada’s  permit  application  to  the  Depart-
ment of State of May 4, 2012: 

(A)  all  applicable  requirements  of  the  National  Environmental  Policy 

Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.; and 

(B)  any  other  provision  of  law  that  requires  executive  department  con-
sultation  or  review  (including  the  consultation  or  review  required  under 
section  7(a)  of  the  Endangered  Species  Act  of  1973,  16  U.S.C.  1536(a)). 
(iii)  To  the  maximum  extent  permitted  by  law,  any  Federal  permit  or 
authorization issued before the date of this memorandum for the Keystone 
XL  Pipeline  shall  remain  in  effect  until  the  completion  of  the  project. 
(iv) The agency notification and fifteen-day delay requirements of sections 
1(g),  1(h),  and  1(i)  of  Executive  Order  13337  are  hereby  waived  on  the

Notice  of  January  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to  Iran 

On  March  15,  1995,  by  Executive  Order  12957,  the  President  declared  a 
national emergency with respect to Iran to deal with the unusual and extraor-
dinary  threat  to  the  national  security,  foreign  policy,  and  economy  of  the 
United  States  constituted  by  the  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government 
of Iran. On May 6, 1995, the President issued Executive Order (E.O.) 12959, 
imposing  more  comprehensive  sanctions  on  Iran  to  further  respond  to  this 
threat.  On  August  19,  1997,  the  President  issued  E.O.  13059,  consolidating 
and  clarifying  the  previous  orders.  I  took  additional  steps  pursuant  to  this 
national  emergency  in  E.O.  13553  of  September  28,  2010,  E.O.  13574  of 
May  23,  2011,  E.O.  13590  of  November  20,  2011,  E.O.  13599  of  February 
5,  2012,  E.O.  13606  of  April  22,  2012,  E.O.  13608  of  May  1,  2012,  E.O. 
13622  of  July  30,  2012,  E.O.  13628  of  October  9,  2012,  and  E.O.  13645 
of June 3, 2013. 
On  July  14,  2015,  the  P5+1  (China,  France,  Germany,  Russia,  the  United 
Kingdom,  and  the  United  States),  the  European  Union,  and  Iran  reached 
a  Joint  Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action  (JCPOA)  to  ensure  that  Iran’s  nuclear 
program  is  and  will  remain  exclusively  peaceful.  January  16,  2016,  marked 
Implementation Day under the JCPOA, when the International Atomic Energy 
Agency (IAEA) issued a report verifying that Iran had completed key nuclear- 
related steps as specified in the JCPOA, and the Secretary of State confirmed 
the  report’s  findings.  As  a  result,  the  United  States  lifted  nuclear-related 
sanctions on Iran consistent with its commitments under the JCPOA, includ-
ing the termination of a number of Executive Orders that were issued pursu-
ant  to  this  national  emergency.  While  nuclear-related  sanctions  were  lifted 
pursuant  to  our  JCPOA  commitments,  a  number  of  non-nuclear  sanctions 
remain in place. 
Since  Implementation  Day,  the  IAEA  has  repeatedly  verified,  and  the  Sec-
retary of State has confirmed, that Iran continues to meet its nuclear commit-
ments  pursuant  to  the  JCPOA.  However,  irrespective  of  the  JCPOA,  which 
continues  to  ensure  that  Iran’s  nuclear  program  is  and  remains  exclusively 
peaceful,  certain  actions  and  policies  of  the  Government  of  Iran  continue 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign 
policy,  and  economy  of  the  United  States.  For  this  reason,  the  national 
emergency  declared  on  March  15,  1995,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond 
March 15, 2017. Therefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing for 1 year the national 
emergency  with  respect  to  Iran  declared  in  E.O.  12957.  The  emergency 
declared by E.O. 12957 constitutes an emergency separate from that declared 
on  November  14,  1979,  by  E.O.  12170.  This  renewal,  therefore,  is  distinct 
from the emergency renewal of November 2016.

Proclamation  9586  of  March  31,  2017 

World  Autism  Awareness  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
On World Autism Awareness Day, we highlight the importance of addressing 
the  causes  and  improving  the  treatments  for  autism  spectrum  disorders 
(ASDs).  We  also  recognize  the  importance  of  identifying  ASDs  early  in 
a  child’s  life  and  of  understanding  the  obstacles  faced  by  people  living 
on  the  autism  spectrum.  Together,  we  celebrate  the  many  ways  individuals 
with  ASDs  enhance  our  daily  lives  and  make  priceless  contributions  to 
our schools, workplaces, and communities. 
Autism  spectrum  disorders  affect  an  estimated  one  out  of  every  68  children 
in  America.  Individuals  and  families  living  with  autism  come  from  diverse 
backgrounds.  These  families  face  enormous  challenges  in  assisting  their 
loved  ones  over  the  course  of  their  lifetimes.  As  those  with  ASDs  reach 
early  adulthood,  families  are  often  faced  with  even  greater  obstacles  than 
during childhood, including planning for the successful transition into adult-
hood and independent life. 
We  are  hopeful  that  our  Nation’s  efforts  will  result  in  significant  advance-
ments  related  to  autism  diagnosis  and  treatments  in  the  months  and  years 
ahead. Ongoing efforts to scan the human genome carry significant potential 
to better manage the disorder and, ultimately, find a cure. My Administration 
will  continue  to  work  with  the  Congress  to  implement  the  21st  Century 
Cures  Act  and  help  to  clear  the  way  for  breakthroughs  in  medical  science. 
Together,  we  will  turn  scientific  discoveries  into  real  solutions  for  people 
with complex health issues like autism. 
Cutting edge therapies and lifelong treatments can impose enormous burdens 
and  expenses  on  the  families  of  people  with  autism  spectrum  disorders. 
I  applaud  the  efforts  by  Members  of  Congress  to  enact  tax-free  savings 
vehicles  for  families  of  people  with  disabilities  and  ASDs.  I  also  encourage 
the  ongoing  public-private  efforts  to  develop  new  technologies  to  prevent 
wandering and keep individuals with ASDs safe. 
For  generations,  men  and  women  living  on  the  autism  spectrum  have  made 
extraordinary contributions in the fields of science, technology, art, literature, 
business,  politics,  and  many  other  professions.  Yet  the  world  still  has  a 
great  deal  to  learn  about  ASDs.  We  must  continue  our  research  to  improve 
early  identification  and  intervention,  strengthen  our  comprehension  of  the 
disorder,  and  open  opportunities  for  every  member  of  our  society  to  live 
independently  and  live  the  American  Dream.  My  Administration  is  com-
mitted to promoting greater knowledge of ASDs and encouraging innovation 
that will lead to new treatments and cures for autism. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  Donald  J.  Trump,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  Sunday,  April  2, 
2017,  as  World  Autism  Awareness  Day.  I  invite  all  Americans  to  Light 
it  Up  Blue,  which  Melania  and  I  will  do  at  the  White  House.  I  call  upon 
all  Americans  to  learn  more  about  the  signs  of  autism  to  improve  early 
diagnosis,  understand  the  challenges  faced  by  those  with  autism  spectrum 
disorders,  and  to  do  what  they  can  to  support  individuals  with  autism 
spectrum disorders and their families.

Proclamation  9440  of  April  29,  2016 

Public  Service  Recognition  Week,  2016 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Our Nation’s progress has long been fueled by the efforts of selfless citizens 
who  come  together  in  service  to  their  fellow  Americans  to  change  our 
country  for  the  better.  At  the  birth  of  our  Nation,  our  Founders  fought 
to  secure  a  democracy  that  represents  the  people,  and  the  civil  servants 
who pour everything they have into making a difference are the individuals 
who  keep  that  democracy  running  smoothly  and  effectively.  During  Public 
Service  Recognition  Week,  we  honor  those  who  dedicate  themselves  to 
ensuring  America’s  promise  rings  true  in  every  corner  of  our  country,  and 
we recommit to upholding the values they fight for every day. 
Civil servants demonstrate resolve and inspire optimism in sectors throughout 
our  country.  They  are  engineers  and  educators,  military  service  members 
and  social  workers,  and  their  individual  and  collective  contributions  drive 
us  forward  on  the  path  toward  an  ever  brighter  tomorrow.  Both  at  home 
and  abroad,  they  carry  forward  the  notion  that  as  Americans,  we  are  com-
mitted  to  looking  out  for  one  another  and  to  working  together  to  forge 
a  bright  future  for  generations  to  come.  And  the  only  way  our  Nation’s 
civil  service  will  remain  at  the  forefront  of  our  progress  is  for  talented 
and  patriotic  young  people  to  join  in  the  effort  of  serving  their  fellow 
Americans—whether for 1 year or throughout their career. 
Throughout  this  week,  we  recognize  the  tireless  efforts  of  the  women  and 
men  who  strive  to  make  sure  ours  is  a  government  that  stays  true  to  its 
founding ideals. With 85 percent of Federal Government jobs located outside 
of  the  Washington,  DC  area,  our  Federal  workers,  together  with  leaders 
and  advocates  from  State  and  local  levels,  play  key  roles  in  ensuring  the 
voices  of  the  American  people  are  heard.  And  even  in  the  toughest  of 
circumstances,  including  a  politics  that  does  not  always  fully  recognize 
the  value  of  their  work,  our  public  servants—often  at  great  personal  sac-
rifice—continue striving to build a better country and to bring lasting change 
to  the  lives  of  ordinary  people  across  America.  These  selfless  individuals 
tackle  great  challenges  facing  our  country.  Whether  leading  important  sci-
entific  advances,  helping  homeless  veterans  get  off  the  street  and  reclaim 
their  lives,  supporting  small  businesses  and  impoverished  communities,  or 
sustaining  our  environment  by  reducing  harmful  pollutants  emitted  into 
our  air  and  waterways,  these  often  unsung  heroes  make  vital  contributions 
to  our  country  and  help  make  our  founding  promise  real  for  more  people. 
The  well-being  of  our  people  depends  on  the  passion  and  dedication  of 
our  workforce,  and  my  Administration  has  worked  to  recruit,  uplift,  and 
empower  exceptional  civil  servants.  In  an  effort  to  fully  realize  the  belief 
that all of us have the capacity to make a meaningful difference and contribute 
to  our  shared  success,  I  have  directed  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management 
to  begin  taking  action  to  ‘‘ban  the  box’’  on  most  Federal  job  applications 
so  we  are  not  disqualifying  people  with  a  criminal  record  simply  because 
of  a  mistake  they  made  in  the  past.  Additionally,  we  are  implementing 
programs  that  encourage  Government-wide  collaboration,  giving  workers  a 
chance  to  lend  and  develop  their  talents  across  agencies  and  departments 
so our best ideas can flourish and grow to their fullest potential.

Serving  the  public  is  not  just  about  a  paycheck—it’s  about  contributing 
to  the  steady  effort  to  perfect  our  Union  over  time  so  our  democracy  works 
for  everyone.  This  week,  let  us  embrace  the  hopeful  spirit  that  embodies 
the  extraordinary  work  of  our  civil  servants.  It  is  the  same  spirit  that  built 
America,  and  because  of  the  hard  work  of  compassionate  and  determined 
public  servants,  it  will  continue  to  build  us  up  for  generations  to  come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States

to  recognize  the  hard  work  and  dedication  of  our  Nation’s  public  servants

through appropriate activities, events, and programs.

Proclamation  9649  of  September  29,  2017 

National  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Domestic  violence  is  never  acceptable.  During  National  Domestic  Violence 
Awareness  Month,  I  call  on  all  Americans  to  promote  the  safety  and  liberty 
of the women, men, and children who are subjected to violent, intimidating, 
or controlling behavior at the hands of those closest to them. 
All  humans  have  inherent  dignity,  and  no  one  deserves  to  be  in  an  abusive 
relationship. While the rate of domestic violence in our country has decreased 
over  the  last  two  decades,  domestic  violence  continues  to  spread  across 
our  Nation.  Nearly  1  in  4  American  women  aged  18  and  older  have  been 
the victim of physical violence by an intimate partner, and domestic violence 
is  still  the  leading  cause  of  injury  to  women.  Emotional  abuse  is  also 
sadly  too  prevalent  in  our  communities,  and  can  inflict  deep  scars  on 
those  caught  in  an  up-and-down  cycle  of  belittling,  aggressive  behavior 
even in what can feel like a healthy relationship. 
We  share  a  moral  obligation  to  recognize,  address,  and  stop  domestic  vio-
lence.  Each  of  us  must  be  a  voice  for  those  suffering  in  silence  and  must 
speak  up  when  we  see  signs  of  physical  or  emotional  abuse.  Together 
we can bolster victims’ support networks and encourage and empower them 
to report offenses. 
We  recognize  and  applaud  the  many  advocates,  clergy,  victim-service  pro-
viders,  educators,  law  enforcement  officers,  family  members,  and  friends 
who  render  daily  aid  to  victims  of  harmful  and  destructive  relationships, 
often  as  first  responders.  Tens  of  thousands  of  women  and  children  find 
refuge  in  domestic  violence  emergency  shelters  and  transition  housing  each 
day,  but  thousands  more  are  turned  away.  That  is  why  the  Department 
of  Health  and  Human  Services  and  the  Department  of  Housing  and  Urban 
Development  are  engaged  in  the  critical  work  of  funding  domestic  violence 
shelters  and  hotlines.  And  each  year,  the  Department  of  Justice  Office  on 
Violence  Against  Women  awards  hundreds  of  millions  of  Federal  grant 
dollars to support law enforcement efforts to assist victims and hold offenders 
accountable. 
During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, I encourage Americans 
affected by domestic violence to seek help. Your neighbors, places of worship, 
community,  and  Nation  stand  ready  to  support  you.  I  remain  deeply  com-
mitted  to  ensuring  that  our  Nation  is  one  where  all  may  live  free  of  fear, 
violence, and abuse, especially in their own homes. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  October  2017  as 
National  Domestic  Violence  Awareness  Month.  I  call  on  all  Americans  to 
stand  firm  in  condemning  domestic  violence  and  supporting  victims  of 
these  crimes  in  finding  the  safety  and  recovery  they  need  and  to  support, 
recognize,  and  trust  in  the  efforts  of  law  enforcement  to  hold  offenders 
accountable,  protect  victims  of  crime  and  their  communities,  and  prevent 
future violence.

Proclamation  9598  of  April  28,  2017 

National  Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

During  National  Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month,  we  remind  Americans 
of  all  ages  and  backgrounds  that  maintaining  a  healthy  and  active  lifestyle 
is  critical  to  long-term  physical  and  mental  well-being,  productivity,  and 
quality  of  life.  We  also  highlight  the  close  relationship  between  sports  and 
physical fitness and the benefits related to participation in sports, including 
disease  prevention,  lessons  in  teamwork  and  leadership,  and  the  practice 
of overcoming adversity. In addition to their physical health benefits, sports 
promote  positive  mentoring,  discipline,  and  structure  for  young  Americans. 

In  1956,  President  Dwight  D.  Eisenhower  formed  the  President’s  Council 
on Youth Fitness, demonstrating a national commitment to improving health 
and  physical  fitness.  President  Eisenhower’s  legacy  lives  on  today  in  the 
form  of  the  President’s  Council  on  Fitness,  Sports,  and  Nutrition,  which 
advises  me  on  health  and  fitness  and  engages  with  communities  across 
the  country  to  improve  youth  fitness  and  empower  Americans  to  adopt 
healthy  lifestyles  that  include  regular  physical  activity  and  good  nutrition. 
My  Administration  will  continue  this  tradition,  with  a  particular  focus  on 
promoting sports and physical fitness among our youth. 

As  we  each  work  to  maintain  our  own  physical  fitness,  we  play  a  part 
in  building  a  stronger  and  healthier  America.  Failure  to  engage  in  physical 
activity  contributes  to  serious  negative  health  outcomes,  including  obesity 
and diseases such as type 2 diabetes, and an increased risk of heart disease, 
the number one cause of death in America. Complications from these health 
problems  often  impact  quality  of  life  and  frequently  lead  to  other  related 
and debilitating conditions. 

As  we  celebrate  National  Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month,  let  us  commit 
ourselves  to  celebrating  active  lifestyles,  promoting  physical  fitness,  and 
tackling  public  health  issues  together  by  making  healthier  choices.  Let  us 
rededicate ourselves each day to childhood obesity prevention, and recognize 
the role that sports can play in our Nation’s health and well-being. Through-
out  May,  I  encourage  all  Americans  to  eat  nutritious  food,  to  take  more 
time  each  day  to  be  active,  and  to  inspire  friends,  family,  peers,  and  loved 
ones to do the same. 

Finally,  the  Americans  who  serve  our  Nation’s  youth  through  sports  and 
other physical activities deserve our collective appreciation. Whether through 
coaching,  driving  kids  to  and  from  practice,  or  organizing  the  leagues  and 
events  that  make  sport  competitions  possible,  these  Americans  make  count-
less unseen sacrifices that merit special recognition. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim May 2017, as National 
Physical  Fitness  and  Sports  Month.  I  call  upon  the  people  of  the  United 
States  to  make  physical  activity  and  sports  participation  a  priority  in  their 
lives.

8791 

Proclamation  9571  of  January  25,  2017 

National  School  Choice  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  foundation  of  a  good  life  begins  with  a  great  education.  Today,  too 
many  of  our  children  are  stuck  in  schools  that  do  not  provide  this  oppor-
tunity. 
Because  the  education  of  our  young  people  is  so  important,  the  parents 
of  every  student  in  America  should  have  a  right  to  a  meaningful  choice 
about where their child goes to school. 
By  expanding  school  choice  and  providing  more  educational  opportunities 
for  every  American  family,  we  can  help  make  sure  that  every  child  has 
an equal shot at achieving the American Dream. More choices for our students 
will make our schools better for everybody. 
Our  country  is  home  to  many  great  schools  and  many  extraordinary  teach-
ers—whether they serve in traditional public schools, public charter schools, 
magnet  schools,  private  or  religious  schools,  or  in  homeschooling  environ-
ments. 
With  a  renewed  commitment  to  expanding  school  choice  for  our  children, 
we  can  truly  make  a  great  education  possible  for  every  child  in  America. 
I  commend  our  Nation’s  students,  parents,  teachers,  and  school  leaders 
for  their  commitment  to  quality,  effective  education,  and  I  call  on  States 
and communities to support effective education and school choice for every 
child in America. 
As our country celebrates National School Choice Week, I encourage parents 
to  evaluate  the  educational  opportunities  available  for  their  children.  I  also 
encourage  State  lawmakers  and  Federal  lawmakers  to  expand  school  choice 
for millions of additional students. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  22  through 
January 28, 2017, as National School Choice Week.

Notice  of  January  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Libya 

On  February  25,  2011,  by  Executive  Order  13566,  I  declared  a  national 
emergency  pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act 
(50  U.S.C.  1701–1706)  to  deal  with  the  unusual  and  extraordinary  threat 
to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted 
by  the  actions  of  Colonel  Muammar  Qadhafi,  his  government,  and  close 
associates, who took extreme measures against the people of Libya, including 
by using weapons of war, mercenaries, and wanton violence against unarmed 
civilians. In addition, there was a serious risk that Libyan state assets would 
be  misappropriated  by  Qadhafi,  members  of  his  government,  members  of 
his  family,  or  his  close  associates  if  those  assets  were  not  protected.  The 
foregoing  circumstances,  the  prolonged  attacks,  and  the  increased  numbers 
of  Libyans  seeking  refuge  in  other  countries  caused  a  deterioration  in  the 
security of Libya and posed a serious risk to its stability. 

The  situation  in  Libya  continues  to  pose  an  unusual  and  extraordinary 
threat  to  the  national  security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States, 
and  we  need  to  protect  against  the  diversion  of  assets  or  other  abuse  by 
certain members of Qadhafi’s family and other former regime officials. 

For  this  reason,  the  national  emergency  declared  on  February  25,  2011, 
must  continue  in  effect  beyond  February  25,  2017.  Therefore,  in  accordance 
with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C.  1622(d)), 
I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive 
Order 13566. 

This  notice  shall  be  published  in  the  Federal  Register  and  transmitted  to 
the Congress.

Executive  Order  13785  of  March  31,  2017 

Establishing  Enhanced  Collection  and  Enforcement  of  Anti-
dumping  and  Countervailing  Duties  and  Violations  of  Trade 
and  Customs  Laws 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  promote  the  efficient 
and effective administration of United States trade laws, it is hereby ordered 
as follows: 
Section 1. Policy. Importers that unlawfully evade antidumping and counter-
vailing  duties  expose  United  States  employers  to  unfair  competition  and 
deprive  the  Federal  Government  of  lawful  revenue.  As  of  May  2015,  $2.3 
billion  in  antidumping  and  countervailing  duties  owed  to  the  Government 
remained  uncollected,  often  from  importers  that  lack  assets  located  in  the 
United  States.  It  is  therefore  the  policy  of  the  United  States  to  impose 
appropriate  bonding  requirements,  based  on  risk  assessments,  on  entries 
of articles subject to antidumping and countervailing duties, when necessary 
to protect the revenue of the United States. 
Sec. 2. Definitions. For the purposes of this order: 

(a)  the  term  ‘‘importer’’  has  the  meaning  given  in  section  4321  of  title 

19, United States Code; and 

(b)  the  term  ‘‘covered  importer’’  means  any  importer  of  articles  subject 
to  antidumping  or  countervailing  duties  for  which  one  of  the  following 
is true: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has no record of previous 
imports  by  the  importer;  CBP  has  a  record  of  the  importer’s  failure  to 
fully  pay  antidumping  or  countervailing  duties;  or  CBP  has  a  record  of 
the  importer’s  failure  to  pay  antidumping  or  countervailing  duties  in  a 
timely manner. 
Sec.  3.  Implementation  Plan  Development.  Within  90  days  of  the  date  of 
this  order,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall,  in  consultation  with 
the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  the  Secretary  of  Commerce,  and  the  United 
States  Trade  Representative,  develop  a  plan  that  would  require  covered 
importers  that,  based  on  a  risk  assessment  conducted  by  CBP,  pose  a  risk 
to  the  revenue  of  the  United  States,  to  provide  security  for  antidumping 
and  countervailing  duty  liability  through  bonds  and  other  legal  measures, 
and  also  would  identify  other  appropriate  enforcement  measures.  This  plan 
shall  be  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  section  4321  and  section  1623 
of title 19, United States Code, and corresponding regulations. 
Sec. 4. Trade and Suspected Customs Law Violations Enforcement. (a) Within 
90  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security, 
through  the  Commissioner  of  CBP,  shall  develop  and  implement  a  strategy 
and  plan  for  combating  violations  of  United  States  trade  and  customs  laws 
for  goods  and  for  enabling  interdiction  and  disposal,  including  through 
methods  other  than  seizure,  of  inadmissible  merchandise  entering  through 
any mode of transportation, to the extent authorized by law. 

(b)  To  ensure  the  timely  and  efficient  enforcement  of  laws  protecting 
Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) holders from the importation of counterfeit 
goods, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall take all appropriate steps, including rulemaking if necessary, to ensure 
that CBP can, consistent with law, share with rights holders:

(ii)  any  information  regarding  merchandise  voluntarily  abandoned,  as  de-
fined  in  section  127.12  of  title  19,  Code  of  Federal  Regulations,  before

importation  of  the  merchandise  would  have  violated  United  States  trade 
laws. 

Sec.  5.  Priority  Enforcement.  The  Attorney  General,  in  consultation  with 
the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall develop recommended prosecution

relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. 
(b)  This  order  shall  be  implemented  consistent  with  applicable  law  and 

subject to the availability of appropriations. 

(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit,

Proclamation  9599  of  April  28,  2017 

Older  Americans  Month,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Older  Americans  are  our  Nation’s  memory.  Some  of  today’s  grandparents 
and great-grandparents were born during the Great Depression, lived through 
the  Second  World  War,  witnessed  the  rise  and  fall  of  Communism,  fought 
in  Korea  and  Vietnam,  marched  with  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  and  watched 
the  first  man  walk  on  the  Moon.  Now,  they  surf  the  internet  and  share 
family  photos  on  their  phones  in  a  world  that  is  richer  and  freer  than 
the  one  into  which  they  were  born.  Listening  to  the  stories  of  our  older 
citizens  allows  younger  Americans  to  appreciate  the  country  they  inherited 
and  gain  the  wisdom  necessary  to  make  it  even  better  for  their  children 
and grandchildren. 
As  we  celebrate  Older  Americans  Month,  we  take  the  opportunity  to  thank 
our  seniors  and  recognize  the  enormous  contributions  they  make  to  the 
Nation.  Indeed,  one  of  modern  life’s  greatest  blessings  are  the  medical  ad-
vancements  that  make  it  possible  for  older  people  to  remain  healthy  and 
active well into the later stages of life. We are blessed to have their presence, 
their love, and their unmatched perspective for our families. 
Our  elders  also  have  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  make  a  difference 
in  our  communities  by  sharing  their  talents,  wisdom,  and  time.  America’s 
seniors give back in a myriad of ways, working with children in our schools, 
providing assistance to the sick and shut-in, and inventing new and innova-
tive products. They have made our Nation stronger through their experience, 
knowledge, and willingness to share with others. 
Finally,  during  this  month  we  also  recognize  that,  as  we  age,  many  of 
us  will  need  more  assistance  from  our  friends  and  family.  We  therefore 
recommit  ourselves  to  ensuring  that  older  Americans  are  not  neglected  or 
abused,  receive  the  best  healthcare  available,  live  in  suitable  homes,  have 
adequate  income  and  economic  opportunities,  and  enjoy  freedom  and  inde-
pendence  in  their  golden  years.  They  deserve—and  we  owe  them—nothing 
less. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  May  2017  as  Older 
Americans  Month.  I  call  upon  all  Americans  to  honor  our  elders,  acknowl-
edge  their  contributions,  care  for  those  in  need,  and  reaffirm  our  country’s 
commitment to older Americans this month and throughout the year.

Memorandum  of  January  12,  2017 

Promoting  Diversity  and  Inclusion  in  Our  National  Parks, 
National  Forests,  and  Other  Public  Lands  and  Waters 

Memorandum  for  the  Heads  of  Executive  Departments  and  Agencies 

Our  Federal  lands  and  waters  are  among  our  Nation’s  greatest  treasures— 
from our National Parks and National Forests, to our wild and scenic rivers, 
recreation  areas,  and  other  public  lands  and  waters.  These  natural  and 
historic  sites  give  us  fresh  air  and  clean  water,  places  for  recreation  and 
inspiration,  and  support  for  our  local  communities  and  economies.  As  a 
powerful sign of our democratic ideals, these lands belong to all Americans— 
rich and poor, urban and rural, young and old, from all backgrounds, genders, 
cultures, religious viewpoints, and walks of life. 

Our  public  lands  and  waters  are  treasured  in  part  because  they  tell  the 
story  of  our  Nation.  They  preserve  the  history  from  our  Nation’s  wars, 
protect  cultural  sites  considered  sacred  to  countless  Americans,  and  honor 
the  accomplishments  of  distinctly  American  leaders  ranging  from  Harriet 
Tubman to Abraham Lincoln to Cesar Chavez. I am proud that my Adminis-
tration  has  greatly  expanded  the  stories  that  our  protected  public  lands 
and  waters  tell  about  our  Nation  through  designating  a  diverse  collection 
of  cultural  and  historic  sites  as  new  parks  and  monuments  and  by  restoring 
the  Koyukon  Athabascan  name  of  Denali  to  the  tallest  mountain  in  North 
America.  I  am  proud,  too,  that  my  Administration  has  sought  to  expand 
access  to  our  public  lands  and  waters  and  to  make  them  more  welcoming 
to all Americans, especially those who have not regularly visited our Nation’s 
great  outdoors  or  had  the  means  to  do  so  easily.  Initiatives  like  ‘‘Every 
Kid  in  a  Park’’  complement  additional,  ongoing  efforts  by  Federal  agencies 
to  improve  accessibility,  but  more  work  must  be  done  to  honor  the  promise 
and opportunity of the idea that our public lands belong to every American. 
Over  the  last  8  years,  Federal  land  and  water  management  agencies  have 
also  shown  a  renewed  commitment  to  promoting  equal  opportunity  for 
all employees and in creating work environments where everyone is empow-
ered to reach their full potential. 

The  purpose  of  this  memorandum  is  to  ensure  that  all  Americans  have 
the  opportunity  to  experience  and  enjoy  our  public  lands  and  waters,  that 
all  segments  of  the  population  have  the  chance  to  engage  in  decisions 
about  how  our  lands  and  waters  are  managed,  and  that  our  Federal  work-
force—not  just  the  sites  it  manages—is  drawn  from  the  rich  range  of  the 
diversity  in  our  Nation.  In  this  memorandum,  ‘‘diversity’’  refers  to  a  range 
of  characteristics  including  national  origin,  language,  race,  color,  disability, 
ethnicity, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender (including gender identity), 
socioeconomic status, veteran status, and family structure. The term ‘‘inclu-
sion’’  refers  to  a  culture  that  connects  each  employee  to  the  organization; 
encourages  collaboration,  flexibility,  and  fairness;  and  promotes  diversity 
throughout  the  organization  so  that  all  individuals  have  opportunities  to 
participate and contribute to their full potential. 

This  memorandum  is  directed  at  the  Department  of  the  Interior,  the  U.S. 
Forest  Service,  the  Office  of  the  Assistant  Secretary  of  the  Army  for  Civil 
Works,  and  the  National  Oceanic  and  Atmospheric  Administration  (covered 
agencies).

Federal  Register / Vol.  82,  No.  12 / Thursday,  January  19,  2017 / Presidential  Documents 

Promoting diversity and inclusion is not the sole responsibility of one office 
within  a  Federal  agency  but  a  joint  effort  that  requires  engagement  by 
senior  leadership  and  the  entire  workforce.  In  implementing  the  guidance 
in  this  memorandum,  each  covered  agency  shall  ensure  its  diversity  and 
inclusion  practices  are  fully  integrated  into  broader  planning  efforts  and 
supported by sufficient resource allocations and effective programs that pro-
mote a wide range of investments in personnel development, public engage-
ment, and opportunities for inclusive access. 
Therefore,  by  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  I  hereby  direct  the  following: 
Section  1.  Diversity  and  Inclusion  in  the  Federal  Workforce.  The  quality 
and integrity of our National Parks, National Forests, and other public lands 
and waters depend on the public servants who steward them for the benefit 
of current and future generations. To ensure we are managing these resources 
responsibly,  we  must  have  a  diverse  and  inclusive  Federal  workforce  prac-
ticing public land management that recognizes the challenges facing commu-
nities  across  the  Nation.  A  more  diverse  and  inclusive  Federal  workforce 
also  creates  a  more  welcoming  experience  for  all  Americans,  no  matter 
their background or where they live, and encourages engagement with Federal 
agencies  on  the  management  and  future  of  our  public  lands  and  waters. 
Consistent  with  existing  authorities,  each  covered  agency  shall  prioritize 
building  a  more  diverse  and  inclusive  Federal  workforce  reflective  of  our 
Nation and its citizens. 
Federal  agencies  are  subject  to  existing  authorities  aimed  at  addressing  the 
leadership  role  and  obligations  of  the  Federal  Government  as  an  employer. 
For  example,  Executive  Order  13583  of  August  18,  2011  (Establishing  a 
Coordinated  Government-wide  Initiative  to  Promote  Diversity  and  Inclusion 
in the Federal Workforce), requires Federal agencies to take action to promote 
equal opportunity, diversity, and inclusion in the Federal workforce. Federal 
agencies  also  are  required  by  section  717  of  title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights 
Act  of  1964  to  take  proactive  steps  to  ensure  equal  opportunity  for  all 
Federal  employees  and  applicants  for  Federal  employment.  This  memo-
randum  directs  each  of  the  covered  agencies  to  pursue  additional  actions 
that  create  and  maintain  a  diverse  and  inclusive  Federal  workforce.  Toward 
that  end,  each  covered  agency  shall  integrate  the  following  activities  in 
its  efforts  to  comply  with  related  statutory  mandates,  Executive  Orders, 
regulatory requirements, and individual agency policies: 

(a)  Provide  professional  development  opportunities  and  tools.  A  diverse 
and inclusive work environment enhances the ability of each covered agency 
to  create,  retain,  and  sustain  a  strong  workforce  by  allowing  all  employees 
to perform to their full potential and talent. Professional development oppor-
tunities  and  tools  are  key  to  fostering  that  potential,  and  ensuring  that 
all  employees  have  access  to  them  should  be  a  priority  for  all  agencies, 
consistent  with  merit  system  principles.  Accordingly,  each  covered  agency 
shall: 

(i)  Develop  a  mechanism  to  conduct  periodic  interviews  with  a  voluntary 
representative cross-section of its workforce to gain a more complete under-
standing of the reasons that employees choose to stay with their organiza-
tions,  as  well  as  to  receive  feedback  on  workplace  policies,  professional 
development opportunities, and other issues; 
(ii) Provide optional exit interviews or surveys for all departing personnel; 
(iii) Collect information as needed to identify methods for attracting appli-
cants  to  Federal  employment  and  retaining  diverse  workplace  talent 
through existing workforce programs and initiatives; 
(iv)  Prioritize  resources,  as  appropriate,  to  expand  professional  develop-
ment  opportunities  that  support  mission  needs,  such  as  academic  and 
fellowship  programs,  private-public  exchanges,  and  detail  assignments  to 
private  or  international  organizations,  State,  local  and  tribal  governments, 
or other branches of the Federal Government;

(v) Offer, or sponsor employees to participate in, a Senior Executive Service 
Candidate  Development  Program  or  other  program  that  trains  employees 
to  gain  the  skills  required  for  senior-level  appointments.  Each  covered 
agency  shall  consider  the  number  of  expected  senior-level  vacancies  as 
one  factor  in  determining  the  number  of  candidates  to  select  for  such 
programs. In the selection process for these programs, each covered agency 
shall  consider  redacting  personal  information,  including  applicant  names, 
from  all  materials  provided  for  review  to  reduce  the  potential  for  uncon-
scious  bias.  Each  covered  agency  also  shall  evaluate  on  a  retroactive 
basis  the  placement  rate  of  program  graduates  into  senior-level  positions, 
including  available  demographic  data,  on  an  annual  basis  to  look  for 
ways  to  improve  outreach  and  recruitment  for  these  programs  consistent 
with  merit  system  principles.  Each  covered  agency  shall  consult  with 
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  on  the  development  or  en-
hancement of data-collection tools to conduct these evaluations; and 
(vi) Seek additional opportunities for the development and implementation 
of upward mobility programs. 
(b) Strengthen leadership engagement and accountability. Senior leadership 
and  supervisors  play  an  important  role  in  fostering  diversity  and  inclusion 
in  the  workforce  they  lead  and  setting  an  example  for  cultivating  this  and 
future  generations  of  talent.  Toward  that  end,  each  covered  agency  shall: 
(i)  Reward  and  recognize  efforts  to  promote  diversity  and  inclusion  in 
the workforce. Consistent with merit system principles, each covered agen-
cy  is  strongly  encouraged  to  consider  implementing  performance  and  ad-
vancement  requirements  that  reward  and  recognize  senior  leaders’  and 
supervisors’ success in fostering diverse and inclusive workplace environ-
ments and in cultivating talent, such as through participation in mentoring 
programs or sponsorship initiatives, recruitment events, and other opportu-
nities.  Each  covered  agency  also  is  encouraged  to  identify  opportunities 
for  senior  leadership  and  supervisors  to  participate  in  outreach  events 
and  discuss  issues  related  to  promoting  diversity  and  inclusion  in  its 
workforce  on  a  regular  basis  with  support  from  any  existing  employee 
resource group, as appropriate; and 
(ii)  Expand  training  on  unconscious  bias,  diversity  and  inclusion,  and 
flexible  work  policies.  Each  covered  agency  shall  expand  its  provision 
of  training  on  unconscious  bias,  diversity  and  inclusion,  and  flexible 
work  policies  and  make  unconscious  bias  training  mandatory  for  senior 
leadership and management positions, including for employees responsible 
for  outreach,  recruitment,  hiring,  career  development,  promotion,  and  law 
enforcement.  The  provision  of  training  may  be  implemented  in  a  phased 
approach commensurate with agency resources. Each covered agency shall 
also  make  available  training  on  a  2-year  cycle  for  bureaus,  directorates, 
or  divisions  for  which  inclusion  scores,  such  as  those  measured  by  the 
New  IQ  index,  demonstrate  no  improvement  since  the  previous  training 
cycle. Special attention should be given to ensure the continuous incorpora-
tion  of  research-based  best  practices,  including  those  to  address  the  rela-
tionship between certain demographics and job positions. 
(c)  Analyze  existing  data  and  identify  opportunities  for  improvement. 
Each covered agency shall continue to evaluate and eliminate existing barriers 
to the successful growth of diversity and inclusion in the Federal workplace. 
The  following  actions  shall  be  taken  to  ensure  continued  progress  on  this 
issue: 

(i)  Each  covered  agency  shall  integrate  the  activities  described  under  sub-
sections  (a)  and  (b)  of  this  section  in  the  priorities  and  actions  outlined 
in  Executive  Order  13583  and  the  periodic  agency  self-assessments  and 
barrier  analyses  required  by  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commission 
Management Directive 715, and shall make such assessments and analyses 
publicly available; 
(ii)  Human  resources  and  any  appropriate  diversity  and  leadership  staff 
from  each  of  the  covered  agencies  shall  meet  at  least  twice  each  year

with  agency  leadership  to  discuss  actions  pursued  under  sections  1(a) 
and 1(b) of this memorandum, including working to identify and eliminate 
barriers  to  promoting  diversity  and  inclusion  in  agency  workforces  and 
to  discuss  potential  actions  to  improve  hiring  programs,  recruitment,  and 
workforce training and development. Where data gaps are identified, each 
covered  agency  is  encouraged  to  collect  additional  information  as  needed 
in order to identify methods for attracting and retaining talent from diverse 
populations, with particular attention to senior and management positions. 
Each  covered  agency  shall  consult  with  OPM  on  the  development  or 
enhancement of data-collection tools to collect this information; and 
(iii)  OPM  shall  continue  to  review  covered  agency-specific  diversity  and 
inclusion  plans  and  provide  recommended  modifications  for  agency  con-
sideration,  including  recommendations  on  strategies  to  promote  diversity 
and  inclusion  in  agency  workforces  and  potential  improvements  to  the 
use of existing agency hiring authorities. 

Sec.  2.  Enhancing  Opportunities  for  all  Americans  to  Experience  Public 
Lands and Waters. (a) Recognizing that our public lands belong to all Ameri-
cans,  it  is  critical  that  all  Americans  can  experience  Federal  lands  and 
waters  and  the  benefits  they  provide,  and  that  diverse  populations  are  able 
to provide input to inform the management and stewardship of these impor-
tant  resources.  In  order  to  achieve  this  goal,  each  covered  agency  shall: 
(i) Identify site-specific opportunities. As each covered agency periodically 
updates  or  develops  new  management  plans  for  its  lands  and  waters, 
it  shall  evaluate  specific  barriers  and  opportunities,  as  appropriate,  to 
improve visitation, access, and recreational opportunities for diverse popu-
lations; 
(ii)  Update  policies  to  ensure  engagement  with  diverse  constituencies. 
As policy manuals and handbooks are updated, each covered agency shall 
ensure that these materials reflect the importance of engaging with diverse 
populations  in  resource  protection,  land  and  water  management,  and  pro-
gram planning and decisionmaking, as appropriate; 
(iii)  Establish  internal  policies  for  recipients  of  Federal  funding.  Each 
covered  agency  shall  ensure  that  State,  local,  tribal,  and  private  sector 
recipients of Federal funding are taking action to improve visitation, access, 
and recreational opportunities for diverse populations; 
(iv) Identify public liaisons. Within 90 days of the issuance of this memo-
randum,  each  covered  agency  shall  identify  multiple  public  liaisons  with 
a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to be charged with facilitating 
input  from  and  engaging  with  diverse  populations  in  land  and  water 
management processes; 
(v) Identify opportunities on advisory councils and stakeholder committees. 
Within 120 days of the issuance of this memorandum, each covered agency 
shall identify opportunities to promote participation by diverse populations 
in  advisory  councils  and  stakeholder  committees  established  to  support 
public land or water management; environmental, public health, or energy 
development planning; and other relevant decisionmaking; and 
(vi)  Develop  an  action  plan.  Within  1  year  of  the  issuance  of  this  memo-
randum,  each  covered  agency  shall  provide  a  publicly  available  action 
plan  to  the  Chair  of  the  White  House  Council  on  Environmental  Quality 
identifying  specific  actions  the  agency  will  take  to  1)  improve  access 
for  diverse  populations—particularly  for  minority,  low-income,  and  dis-
abled  populations  and  tribal  communities—to  experience  and  enjoy  our 
Federal  lands  and  waters,  and  2)  address  barriers  to  their  participation 
in the protection and management of important historic, cultural, or natural 
areas.  Each  covered  agency  shall  identify  in  its  action  plan  any  critical 
barriers  to  achieving  both  of  these  goals.  This  barrier  evaluation  should 
draw  on  internal  staff  input  as  well  as  external  perspectives,  including 
interviews,  surveys,  and  engagement  with  non-governmental  entities,  as

appropriate  and  as  resources  allow.  Each  action  plan  should  include  spe-
cific steps that the covered agency will take to address identified barriers, 
including  national  as  well  as  regional  strategies,  and,  where  appropriate, 
site-specific  initiatives.  Each  covered  agency  should  work  through  the 
Federal  Recreation  Council  (FRC)  to  assist  with  the  development  of  this 
action plan and use the FRC to share best practices and recommendations 
regarding specific programs and initiatives. 
(b)  In  identifying  actions  to  improve  opportunities  for  all  Americans  to 
experience  our  Federal  lands  and  waters,  each  covered  agency  should  con-
sider a range of actions including the following: 

(i) Conducting active outreach to diverse populations—particularly minor-
ity,  low-income,  and  disabled  populations  and  tribal  communities—to 
increase awareness about specific programs and opportunities; 
(ii)  Focusing  on  the  mentoring  of  new  environmental,  outdoor  recreation, 
and  preservation  leaders  to  increase  diverse  representation  in  these  areas 
and on our public lands; 
(iii)  Forging  new  partnerships  with  State,  local,  tribal,  private,  and  non- 
profit partners to expand access for diverse populations, particularly those 
in the immediate vicinity of a protected area; 
(iv) Identifying and making improvements to existing programs to increase 
visitation  and  access  by  diverse  populations—particularly  minority,  low- 
income, and disabled populations and tribal communities; 
(v)  Creating  new  programs,  especially  those  that  could  address  certain 
gaps that are identified; 
(vi) Expanding the use of multilingual and culturally appropriate materials, 
including  American  Sign  Language,  in  public  communications  and  edu-
cational  strategies,  including  through  social  media  strategies,  as  appro-
priate, that target diverse populations; 
(vii) Continuing coordinated, interagency efforts to promote youth engage-
ment  and  empowerment,  including  fostering  new  partnerships  with 
diversity-  and  youth-serving  organizations  and  new  partnerships  with 
urban areas and programs; and 
(viii) Identifying possible staff liaisons to diverse populations, particularly 
those in the immediate vicinity of a given protected area. 
(c)  In  identifying  actions  to  improve  opportunities  for  all  Americans  to 
participate in the protection and management of important historic, cultural, 
and  natural  areas,  each  covered  agency  shall  consider  a  range  of  actions 
including the following: 

(i)  Considering  recommendations  and  proposals  from  diverse  populations 
to protect at-risk historic, cultural, and natural sites; 
(ii)  Improving  the  availability  and  distribution  of  relevant  information 
about ongoing land and water management planning and policy revisions; 
(iii) Identifying agency staff charged with outreach to diverse populations; 
(iv)  Identifying  opportunities  to  facilitate  public  participation  from  inter-
ested diverse populations facing financial barriers, including through part-
nerships,  where  appropriate,  with  philanthropic  organizations  and  tribal,

Executive  Order  13786  of  March  31,  2017 

Omnibus  Report  on  Significant  Trade  Deficits 

By  the  authority  vested  in  me  as  President  by  the  Constitution  and  the 
laws  of  the  United  States  of  America,  and  in  order  to  ensure  the  informed 
exercise  of  the  authority  over  international  trade  granted  to  me  by  law, 
it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section  1.  Policy.  Free  and  fair  trade  is  critical  to  the  Nation’s  prosperity, 
national security, and foreign policy. It is in America’s economic and national 
security  interests  to  promote  commerce  by  strengthening  our  relationships 
with  our  trading  partners,  vigorously  enforcing  our  Nation’s  trade  laws, 
improving  the  overall  conditions  for  competition  and  trade,  and  ensuring 
the strength of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases. 
For many years, the United States has not obtained the full scope of benefits 
anticipated under a number of international trade agreements or from partici-
pating  in  the  World  Trade  Organization.  The  United  States  annual  trade 
deficit  in  goods  exceeds  $700  billion,  and  the  overall  trade  deficit  exceeded 
$500 billion in 2016. 
The  United  States  must  address  the  challenges  to  economic  growth  and 
employment  that  may  arise  from  large  and  chronic  trade  deficits  and  the 
unfair  and  discriminatory  trade  practices  of  some  of  our  trading  partners. 
Unfair and discriminatory practices by our trading partners can deny Ameri-
cans  the  benefits  that  would  otherwise  accrue  from  free  and  fair  trade, 
unduly  restrict  the  commerce  of  the  United  States,  and  put  the  commerce 
of the United States at a disadvantage compared to that of foreign countries. 
To  address  these  challenges,  it  is  essential  that  policy  makers  and  the 
persons  representing  the  United  States  in  trade  negotiations  have  access 
to  current  and  comprehensive  information  regarding  unfair  trade  practices 
and the causes of United States trade deficits. 
Sec.  2.  Report.  Within  90  days  of  the  date  of  this  order,  the  Secretary 
of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative (USTR), in consulta-
tion  with  the  Secretaries  of  State,  the  Treasury,  Defense,  Agriculture,  and 
Homeland  Security,  and  the  heads  of  any  other  executive  departments  or 
agencies with relevant expertise, as determined by the Secretary of Commerce 
and  the  USTR,  shall  prepare  and  submit  to  the  President  an  Omnibus 
Report on Significant Trade Deficits (Report). To aid in preparing the Report, 
the  Secretary  of  Commerce  and  the  USTR  may  hold  public  meetings  and 
seek  comments  from  relevant  State,  local,  and  non-governmental  stake-
holders,  including  manufacturers,  workers,  consumers,  service  providers, 
farmers, and ranchers. The Report shall identify those foreign trading partners 
with  which  the  United  States  had  a  significant  trade  deficit  in  goods  in 
2016. For each identified trading partner, the Report shall: 

(a)  assess  the  major  causes  of  the  trade  deficit,  including,  as  applicable, 
differential  tariffs,  non-tariff  barriers,  injurious  dumping,  injurious  govern-
ment  subsidization,  intellectual  property  theft,  forced  technology  transfer, 
denial of worker rights and labor standards, and any other form of discrimina-
tion  against  the  commerce  of  the  United  States  or  other  factors  contributing 
to the deficit; 

(b)  assess  whether  the  trading  partner  is,  directly  or  indirectly,  imposing 
unequal burdens on, or unfairly discriminating in fact against, the commerce 
of  the  United  States  by  law,  regulation,  or  practice  and  thereby  placing 
the commerce of the United States at an unfair disadvantage;

Proclamation  9601  of  April  28,  2017 

Small  Business  Week,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 

During Small Business Week, we celebrate our Nation’s small business own-
ers,  whose  entrepreneurship  and  hard  work  bring  jobs  and  prosperity  to 
our  communities.  Small  business  owners  embody  the  American  pioneering 
spirit and remind us that determination can turn aspiration into achievement. 
This  week,  we  affirm  our  commitment  to  removing  government  barriers 
to the success of American small businesses. 

Small  businesses  are  an  economic  force  in  this  country,  and  have  grown 
by  nearly  40  percent  since  1982  despite  often  facing  regulatory  headwinds. 
They  employ  almost  58  million  Americans,  accounting  for  about  50  percent 
of  all  private-sector  jobs  in  the  United  States.  Our  communities  depend 
on  the  success  of  small  businesses.  More  than  99  percent  of  all  employer 
firms  in  the  country  are  small  businesses  and  in  recent  years,  too  many 
of  them  have  been  crushed  by  overwhelming  Federal  regulations.  At  the 
beginning  of  my  Administration,  I  met  with  small  business  owners  who 
continue to struggle under too many burdensome regulations. I have already 
signed legislation disapproving many excessive and unreasonable regulations 
and  issued  several  Executive  Orders  to  address  other  overreaching  rules. 
These  actions  will  free  our  Nation’s  entrepreneurs  to  spend  more  time  cre-
ating jobs and less time navigating the Federal bureaucracy. 

My Administration is also working to ensure our Nation’s trade deals estab-
lish  favorable  conditions  for  small  businesses  to  export  their  goods  and 
services.  With  a  level  playing  field  on  the  international  stage,  America’s 
small  businesses  will  lead  an  export  revival  that  brings  jobs  and  wealth 
back to our country. 

Our  Nation  also  deserves  a  tax  system  that  works  for—not  against—small 
business  owners.  One  of  the  biggest  problems  facing  our  small  businesses 
is  an  unduly  complicated,  and  often  unfair,  tax  system.  Tax  reform  will 
unleash  a  new  wave  of  investment,  innovation,  and  entrepreneurship  in 
our  country.  Americans  will  keep  more  money  in  their  pockets,  leaving 
them  with  the  resources  they  need  to  expand  their  businesses  and  hire 
more workers. 

America’s  small  business  owners  transform  ideas  into  reality.  They  are  a 
strong  testament  to  the  opportunities  a  market  economy  affords.  During 
this  week,  we  recognize  the  incredible  contributions  small  businesses  make 
to  our  country  and  pledge  to  foster  the  conditions  that  enable  them  to 
prosper and thrive. 

NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  DONALD  J.  TRUMP,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  April  30  through 
May 6, 2017, as Small Business Week. I call upon all Americans to recognize 
the  critical  contributions  of  America’s  entrepreneurs  and  small  business 
owners as they grow our Nation’s economy.

Proclamation  9567  of  January  12,  2017 

Establishment  of  the  Reconstruction  Era  National  Monument 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
The  Reconstruction  Era,  a  period  spanning  the  early  Civil  War  years  until 
the start of Jim Crow racial segregation in the 1890s, was a time of significant 
transformation in the United States, as the Nation grappled with the challenge 
of  integrating  millions  of  newly  freed  African  Americans  into  its  social, 
political,  and  economic  life.  It  was  in  many  ways  the  Nation’s  Second 
Founding,  as  Americans  abolished  slavery  and  struggled  earnestly,  if  not 
always  successfully,  to  build  a  nation  of  free  and  equal  citizens.  During 
Reconstruction,  Congress  passed  the  Thirteenth,  Fourteenth,  and  Fifteenth 
constitutional  amendments  that  abolished  slavery,  guaranteed  due  process 
and  equal  protection  under  the  law,  and  gave  all  males  the  ability  to  vote 
by  prohibiting  voter  discrimination  based  on  race,  color,  or  previous  condi-
tion  of  servitude.  Ultimately,  the  unmet  promises  of  Reconstruction  led 
to the modern civil rights movement a century later. 
The  Reconstruction  Era  began  when  the  first  United  States  soldiers  arrived 
in  slaveholding  territories,  and  enslaved  people  on  plantations  and  farms 
and  in  cities  escaped  from  their  owners  and  sought  refuge  with  Union 
forces or in free states. This happened in November 1861 in the Sea Islands 
or  ‘‘Lowcountry’’  of  southeastern  South  Carolina,  and  Beaufort  County  in 
particular. Just seven months after the start of the Civil War, Admiral Samuel 
F.  DuPont  led  a  successful  attack  on  Port  Royal  Sound  and  brought  a 
swath of this South Carolina coast under Union control. The white residents 
(less  than  twenty  percent  of  the  population),  including  the  wealthy  owners 
of  rice  and  cotton  plantations,  quickly  abandoned  their  country  plantations 
and  their  homes  in  the  town  of  Beaufort  as  Union  forces  came  ashore. 
More than 10,000 African Americans—about one-third of the enslaved popu-
lation  of  the  Sea  Islands  at  the  time—refused  to  flee  the  area  with  their 
owners. 
Beaufort  County  became  one  of  the  first  places  in  the  United  States  where 
formerly enslaved people could begin integrating themselves into free society. 
While  the  Civil  War  raged  in  the  background,  Beaufort  County  became 
the  birthplace  of  Reconstruction,  or  what  historian  Willie  Lee  Rose  called 
a  ‘‘rehearsal  for  Reconstruction.’’  With  Federal  forces  in  charge  of  the  Sea 
Islands, the Department of the Treasury, with the support of President Lincoln 
and  the  War  Department,  decided  to  turn  the  military  occupation  into  a 
novel social experiment, known as the Port Royal Experiment, to help former 
slaves become self-sufficient. They enlisted antislavery and religious societies 
in the North to raise resources and recruit volunteers for the effort. Missionary 
organizations headquartered in the Northeast established outposts in Beaufort 
County. 
In  and  around  Beaufort  County  during  Reconstruction,  the  first  African 
Americans  enlisted  as  soldiers,  the  first  African  American  schools  were 
founded,  early  efforts  to  distribute  land  to  former  slaves  took  place,  and 
many  of  the  Reconstruction  Era’s  most  significant  African  American  politi-
cians, including Robert Smalls, came to prominence. African American polit-
ical  influence  and  land  ownership  endured  there  long  after  setbacks  in 
other  regions.  In  short,  events  and  people  from  Beaufort  County  illustrate

the  most  important  challenges  of  Reconstruction—crucial  questions  related 
to  land,  labor,  education,  and  politics  after  the  destruction  of  slavery— 
and  some  early  hopeful  efforts  to  address  them.  The  significant  historical 
events  that  transpired  in  Beaufort  County  make  it  an  ideal  place  to  tell 
stories  of  experimentation,  potential  transformation,  hope,  accomplishment, 
and  disappointment.  In  Beaufort  County,  including  St.  Helena  Island,  the 
town  of  Port  Royal,  and  the  city  of  Beaufort,  many  existing  historic  objects 
demonstrate  the  transformative  effect  of  emancipation  and  Reconstruction. 

Freed  people  hungered  for  education,  as  South  Carolina  had  long  forbidden 
teaching  slaves  to  read  and  write.  In  1862,  Laura  M.  Towne  and  Ellen 
Murray  from  Pennsylvania  were  among  the  first  northern  teachers  to  arrive 
as  part  of  the  Port  Royal  Experiment.  They  established  a  partnership  as 
educators  at  the  Penn  School  on  St.  Helena  Island  that  lasted  for  four 
decades.  Charlotte  Forten,  a  well-educated  African  American  woman  from 
a  prominent  abolitionist  family  in  Philadelphia,  joined  the  faculty  later 
that  year.  The  first  classes  for  the  former  slaves  were  held  at  The  Oaks 
plantation  house,  headquarters  of  the  occupying  U.S.  military  forces  in  the 
region.  In  1863,  Murray  and  Towne  moved  their  school  into  Brick  Church, 
a  Baptist  church  near  the  center  of  the  island.  In  the  spring  of  1864,  sup-
porters  in  Philadelphia  purchased  school  buildings  for  Towne  and  Murray, 
and  construction  of  Penn  School  began  across  the  field  from  Brick  Church 
on  50  acres  of  property  donated  by  Hastings  Gantt,  an  African  American 
landowner. 

Penn  School  helped  many  African  Americans  gain  self-respect  and  self- 
reliance and integrate into free society. Towne and Murray strove to provide 
an  education  comparable  to  that  offered  in  the  best  northern  schools.  The 
faculty  also  provided  other  support,  including  medical  care,  social  services, 
and employment assistance. Penn School would evolve into the Penn Center 
in  the  20th  century,  and  remain  a  crucial  place  for  education,  community, 
and  political  organizing  for  decades  to  come.  As  a  meeting  place  in  the 
1950s  and  60s  for  civil  rights  leaders,  including  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King, 
Jr.,  and  the  staff  of  the  Southern  Christian  Leadership  Conference,  this 
historic  place  links  the  democratic  aspirations  of  Reconstruction  to  those 
of  the  modern  civil  rights  movement.  Darrah  Hall  is  the  oldest  standing 
structure  on  the  site  of  the  Penn  School  grounds.  Students  and  community 
members  built  it  around  1903,  during  the  transition  in  the  South  from 
the Reconstruction Era to an era of racial segregation and political disenfran-
chisement. 

The  Brick  Church  where  Towne  and  Murray  held  classes  in  1863–64  is 
today the oldest church on St. Helena Island. Once freed from their owners, 
African  Americans  in  Beaufort  County  wanted  to  worship  in  churches  and 
join  organizations  they  controlled.  The  Brick  Church—also  known  as  the 
Brick  Baptist  Church—was  built  by  slaves  in  1855  for  the  white  planters 
on  St.  Helena  Island.  When  the  white  population  fled  from  the  Sea  Islands 
in  1861,  the  suddenly  freed  African  Americans  made  the  church  their  own. 
The  Brick  Church  has  been  a  place  of  worship  and  gathering  ever  since, 
and  continues  to  serve  the  spiritual  needs  of  the  community  to  this  day. 

Camp  Saxton  in  Port  Royal—formerly  the  site  of  a  plantation  owned  by 
John  Joyner  Smith—is  where  the  First  South  Carolina  Regiment  Volunteers 
mustered  into  the  U.S.  Army  and  trained  from  November  1862  to  January 
1863.  In  August  1862,  U.S.  Brigadier  General  Rufus  Saxton,  the  military 
governor  of  the  abandoned  plantations  in  the  Department  of  the  South, 
received  permission  to  recruit  five  thousand  African  Americans,  mostly 
former slaves, into the Union Army. The former slaves assumed that military 
service  would  lead  to  rights  of  citizenship.  Saxton  selected  Captain  Thomas 
Wentworth Higginson of the 51st Massachusetts, a former Unitarian minister, 
abolitionist, and human rights activist, to command the regiment. An impor-
tant ally of Higginson and the African American troops was Harriet Tubman, 
the  famed  conductor  on  the  Underground  Railroad,  who  in  May  of  1862

arrived  in  Beaufort  as  part  of  the  Port  Royal  Experiment  and  who  served 
skillfully as a nurse at Camp Saxton. 
Camp  Saxton  was  also  the  location  of  elaborate  and  historic  ceremonies 
on  January  1,  1863,  to  announce  and  celebrate  the  issuance  of  the  Emanci-
pation  Proclamation,  which  freed  all  slaves  in  states  then  ‘‘in  rebellion’’ 
against the United States. General Saxton himself had attended church serv-
ices  at  the  Brick  Church  in  the  fall  of  1862  to  recruit  troops  and  to  invite 
everyone,  African  American  and  white,  ‘‘to  come  to  the  camp  .  .  .  on 
New  Year’s  Day,  and  join  in  the  grand  celebration.’’  This  Emancipation 
Proclamation  celebration  was  particularly  significant  because  it  occurred 
in Union-occupied territory in the South where the provisions of the Procla-
mation would actually take effect before the end of the war. 
Over  five  thousand  people,  including  freed  men,  women,  and  children, 
Union  military  officials,  guest  speakers,  and  missionary  teachers,  gathered 
around  the  speakers’  platform  built  in  a  grove  of  live  oaks  near  the  Smith 
plantation  house.  One  of  the  majestic  witness  trees  has  become  known 
as  the  Emancipation  Oak.  Of  all  the  prayers,  hymns,  and  speeches  during 
the  three-hour  ceremony,  one  of  the  most  moving  was  the  spontaneous 
singing of ‘‘My country, tis of thee; Sweet land of liberty’’ when the American 
flag  was  presented  to  Higginson.  As  part  of  the  celebration,  the  military 
had prepared a feast of roasted oxen for all to enjoy. 
The town of Beaufort was the center of the County’s social, political, cultural, 
and  economic  life  during  the  Reconstruction  Era.  Before  the  Battle  of  Port 
Royal  Sound  in  November  1861,  Beaufort  was  where  the  planters  spent 
the  summer  months  in  their  grand  homes.  Beaufort  served  as  the  depot 
for  plantation  supplies  transported  there  by  steamship.  The  Old  Beaufort 
Firehouse,  built  around  1912,  stands  near  the  heart  of  Reconstruction  Era 
Beaufort,  across  the  street  from  the  Beaufort  Arsenal,  and  within  walking 
distance  of  over  fifty  historic  places.  The  Beaufort  Arsenal,  the  location 
today  of  the  Beaufort  History  Museum,  was  built  in  1799,  rebuilt  in  1852, 
and  renovated  by  the  Works  Progress  Administration  in  1934,  and  served 
historically  as  the  home  of  the  Beaufort  Volunteer  Artillery  Company  that 
fought in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. 
Several historic Beaufort properties within walking distance of the Firehouse 
are  associated  with  Robert  Smalls,  the  most  influential  African  American 
politician  in  South  Carolina  during  the  Reconstruction  Era.  Robert  Smalls 
was  born  in  Beaufort  in  1839,  the  son  of  slaves  of  the  Henry  McKee  family. 
When  Smalls  was  twelve  years  old,  his  owner  hired  him  out  to  work 
in  Charleston,  where  he  learned  to  sail,  rig,  and  pilot  ships.  In  May  1862, 
Smalls  navigated  the  CSS  Planter,  a  Confederate  ship,  through  Charleston 
harbor,  past  the  guns  of  Fort  Sumter,  and  turned  it  over  to  Union  forces. 
This  courageous  escape  made  him  an  instant  hero  for  the  Union,  and  he 
soon  began  working  as  a  pilot  for  the  U.S.  Navy.  Smalls  and  his  family 
used prize money awarded for the Planter to purchase the house in Beaufort 
once owned by the family that had owned him. 
In  1864,  Smalls  was  named  to  a  delegation  of  African  American  South 
Carolinians  to  the  Republican  National  Convention  in  Baltimore,  where  the 
delegation  unsuccessfully  petitioned  the  party  to  make  African  American 
enfranchisement  part  of  its  platform.  Elected  to  the  Beaufort  County  School 
Board  in  1867,  Smalls  began  his  advocacy  for  education  as  the  key  to 
African American success in the new political and economic order. 
In  the  years  immediately  following  the  end  of  the  Civil  War,  the  United 
States fiercely debated issues critical to Reconstruction. Southern Democrats 
tried  to  regain  the  power  they  held  before  the  Civil  War.  The  Republican 
majorities in the U.S. Congress rebuffed them, and proceeded to pass legisla-
tion  and  constitutional  amendments  to  implement  the  principles  of  the 
Union  victory.  In  1867,  Congress  passed  the  Military  Reconstruction  Acts 
that  called  for  military  administration  of  southern  states  and  new  state 
constitutions. Voters elected Robert Smalls as a delegate to the South Carolina 
Constitutional  Convention  that  met  in  Charleston  in  January  1868,  where

he successfully advocated for public education with compulsory attendance. 
The  resulting  constitution  also  provided  for  universal  male  suffrage  and 
racial, political, and legal equality. In this new political order, Robert Smalls 
was  elected  to  the  South  Carolina  General  Assembly  from  1868  to  1874, 
first  as  a  representative  and  then  as  a  senator.  In  1874,  Smalls  was  elected 
to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served five terms. 
The  success  of  Smalls  and  other  African  American  lawmakers  who  had 
been  enslaved  only  a  handful  of  years  before  infuriated  South  Carolina’s 
Democrats.  Some  of  them  turned  to  violence,  carried  out  by  the  Ku  Klux 
Klan  and  others.  On  more  than  one  occasion,  a  homegrown  vigilante  group 
known as the Red Shirts terrorized Robert Smalls. 
As  a  result  of  the  contested  Presidential  and  South  Carolina  gubernatorial 
elections  of  1876,  deals  were  made  that  effectively  ended  political  and 
military  Reconstruction  in  1877.  Smalls,  however,  continued  to  serve  in 
Congress  until  1886.  He  then  returned  to  Beaufort,  and  served  for  many 
years as the Presidentially appointed customs collector for the Port of Beau-
fort. 
In 1895, Smalls was elected a delegate to his second South Carolina Constitu-
tional  Convention.  Twenty  years  after  Democrats  had  regained  control  of 
the State government, they had figured out how to take back African Ameri-
cans’  rights  as  citizens.  Smalls  spoke  eloquently  at  the  Convention  against 
this blow to democracy and representative government, but ultimately rights 
hard  won  three  decades  before  were  struck  down.  South  Carolina  voters 
ratified  a  new  constitution  that  effectively  eliminated  African  Americans 
from  electoral  politics  and  codified  racial  segregation  in  law  for  decades 
to come. 
Even  as  Jim  Crow  laws  and  customs  limited  political  participation  and 
access  to  public  accommodations,  African  Americans  maintained  visions 
of  freedom  and  built  strong  community  institutions.  Ownership  of  land, 
access  to  education,  and  churches  and  civic  organizations  that  took  root 
during  the  Reconstruction  Era  laid  the  foundation  for  the  modern  civil 
rights movement. 
The  many  objects  of  historic  interest  described  above  stand  testament  to 
the formative role of the Reconstruction Era—and the enormous contributions 
of those who made it possible—in our shared history. 
WHEREAS,  section  320301  of  title  54,  United  States  Code  (known  as  the 
‘‘Antiquities  Act’’),  authorizes  the  President,  in  his  discretion,  to  declare 
by  public  proclamation  historic  landmarks,  historic  and  prehistoric  struc-
tures,  and  other  objects  of  historic  or  scientific  interest  that  are  situated 
upon the lands owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national 
monuments,  and  to  reserve  as  a  part  thereof  parcels  of  land,  the  limits 
of  which  shall  be  confined  to  the  smallest  area  compatible  with  the  proper 
care and management of the objects to be protected; 
WHEREAS, the Beaufort National Historic Landmark District, which contains 
many  objects  of  historic  interest  including  the  Old  Beaufort  Firehouse,  was 
designated in 1973; and the Penn School National Historic Landmark District, 
which  also  contains  many  objects  of  historic  interest  including  Darrah  Hall 
and the Brick Baptist Church, was designated in 1974; 
WHEREAS,  the  Camp  Saxton  Site  was  listed  in  the  National  Register  of 
Historic Places in 1995; 
WHEREAS,  portions  of  the  former  Camp  Saxton  Site  are  located  today 
on lands administered by the U.S. Department of the Navy at Naval Support 
Facility Beaufort, South Carolina; 
WHEREAS,  Penn  Center,  Inc.,  has  donated  to  the  United  States  fee  title 
to  Darrah  Hall  at  Penn  Center,  St.  Helena  Island,  South  Carolina,  with 
appurtenant  easements,  totaling  approximately  3.78  acres  of  land  and  inter-
ests in land;

tion; 
WHEREAS,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  to  preserve  and  protect  these  sites; 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States

situated  upon  lands  and  interests  in  lands  owned  or  controlled  by  the 
Federal Government to be the Reconstruction Era National Monument (monu-
ment)  and,  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  those  objects,  reserve  as  a  part

and the Interior shall enter into a memorandum of agreement that identifies 
and  assigns  the  responsibilities  of  each  agency  related  to  such  lands,  the 
implementing actions required of each agency, and the processes for resolving 
interagency disputes. 
The  National  Park  Service  is  directed  to  use  applicable  authorities  to  seek 
to  enter  into  agreements  with  others  to  address  common  interests  and  pro-
mote  management  efficiencies,  including  provision  of  visitor  services,  inter-
pretation  and  education,  establishment  and  care  of  museum  collections, 
and preservation of historic objects. 
Given  the  location  of  portions  of  the  monument  on  an  operating  military 
facility,  the  following  provisions  concern  U.S.  Armed  Forces  actions  by 
a  Military  Department,  including  those  carried  out  by  the  United  States 
Coast Guard: 

1.  Nothing  in  this  Proclamation  precludes  the  activities  and  training  of 
the Armed Forces; however, they shall be carried out in a manner consistent 
with  the  care  and  management  of  the  objects  to  the  extent  practicable. 
2.  In  the  event  of  threatened  or  actual  destruction  of,  loss  of,  or  injury 
to  a  monument  resource  or  quality  resulting  from  an  incident  caused  by 
a  component  of  the  Department  of  Defense  or  any  other  Federal  agency, 
the  appropriate  Secretary  or  agency  head  shall  promptly  coordinate  with 
the  Secretary  of  the  Interior  for  the  purpose  of  taking  appropriate  action 
to  respond  to  and  mitigate  the  harm  and,  if  possible,  restore  or  replace 
the monument resource or quality. 

3.  Nothing  in  this  proclamation  or  any  regulation  implementing  it  shall 
limit or otherwise affect the U.S. Armed Forces’ discretion to use, maintain, 
improve,  or  manage  any  real  property  under  the  administrative  control  of 
a Military Department or otherwise limit the availability of such real property 
for military mission purposes. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  deemed  to  revoke  any  existing  with-
drawal,  reservation,  or  appropriation;  however,  the  monument  shall  be  the 
dominant reservation. 
Nothing  in  this  proclamation  shall  be  construed  to  alter  the  authority  or 
responsibility  of  any  party  with  respect  to  emergency  response  activities 
within the monument. 
Warning  is  hereby  given  to  all  unauthorized  persons  not  to  appropriate, 
injure,  destroy,  or  remove  any  feature  of  this  monument  and  not  to  locate 
or settle upon any of the lands thereof.

Proclamation  9568  of  January  13,  2017 

Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  Federal  Holiday,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
When  the  Reverend  Dr.  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  shared  his  dream  with 
the  world  atop  the  steps  of  the  Lincoln  Memorial,  he  gave  mighty  voice 
to  our  founding  ideals.  Few  could  have  imagined  that  nearly  half  a  century 
later,  his  iconic  profile  would  forever  be  memorialized  in  stone,  standing 
tall  and  gazing  outward,  not  far  from  where  he  stirred  our  collective  con-
science  to  action.  In  summoning  a  generation  to  recognize  the  universal 
threat  of  injustice  anywhere,  Dr.  King’s  example  has  proven  that  those 
who love their country can change it. 
A  foot  soldier  for  justice  and  a  giant  of  the  Civil  Rights  Movement,  Dr. 
King  lifted  the  quiet  hopes  of  our  Nation  with  the  powers  of  his  voice 
and  pen.  Whether  behind  his  pulpit  in  Montgomery,  at  a  podium  on  the 
National  Mall,  or  from  his  jail  cell  in  Birmingham,  he  beckoned  us  toward 
justice  through  non-violent  resistance  and  oratory  skill.  Dr.  King  fought 
not merely for the absence of oppression but for the presence of opportunity. 
His  soaring  rhetoric  impelled  others  to  take  up  his  cause,  and  with  struggle 
and  discipline,  persistence  and  faith,  those  who  joined  him  on  his  journey 
began to march. America was watching, and so they kept marching; America 
was  listening,  and  so  they  kept  sounding  the  call  for  justice.  Because  they 
kept  moving  forward  with  unwavering  resistance,  they  changed  not  only 
laws  but  also  hearts  and  minds.  And  as  change  rippled  across  the  land, 
it began to strengthen over time, building on the progress realized on buses, 
in  schools,  and  at  lunch  counters  so  that  eventually,  it  would  reverberate 
in  the  halls  of  government  and  be  felt  in  the  lives  of  people  across  our 
country. 
Those  who  dismiss  the  magnitude  of  the  progress  that  has  been  made 
dishonor  the  courage  of  all  who  marched  and  struggled  to  bring  about 
this  change—and  those  who  suggest  that  the  great  task  of  extending  our 
Nation’s  promise  to  every  individual  is  somehow  complete  neglect  the  sac-
rifices  that  made  it  possible.  Dr.  King  taught  us  that  ‘‘The  ultimate  measure 
of  a  man  is  not  where  he  stands  in  moments  of  convenience  and  comfort, 
but  where  he  stands  at  times  of  challenge  and  controversy.’’  Although  we 
do  not  face  the  same  challenges  that  spurred  the  Civil  Rights  Movement, 
the  fierce  urgency  of  now—and  the  need  for  persistence,  determination, 
and constant vigilance—is still required for us to meet the complex demands 
and  defeat  the  injustices  of  our  time.  With  the  same  iron  will  and  hope 
in  our  hearts,  it  is  our  duty  to  secure  economic  opportunity,  access  to 
education,  and  equal  treatment  under  the  law  for  all.  The  arc  of  the  moral 
universe may bend toward justice, but it only bends because of the strength 
and sacrifice of those who reject complacency and drive us forward. 
As  we  reflect  on  Dr.  King’s  legacy,  we  celebrate  a  man  and  a  movement 
that  transformed  our  country,  and  we  remember  that  our  freedom  is  inex-
tricably  bound  to  the  freedom  of  others.  Given  the  causes  he  championed— 
from  civil  rights  and  international  peace  to  job  creation  and  economic  jus-
tice—it  is  right  that  today  we  honor  his  work  by  serving  others.  Now 
more  than  ever,  we  must  heed  his  teachings  by  embracing  our  convictions. 
We  must  live  our  values,  strive  for  righteousness,  and  bring  goodness  to

others. And at a time when our politics are so sharply polarized and people 
are  losing  faith  in  our  institutions,  we  must  meet  his  call  to  stand  in 
another  person’s  shoes  and  see  through  their  eyes.  We  must  work  to  under-
stand  the  pain  of  others,  and  we  must  assume  the  best  in  each  other. 
Dr. King’s life reminds us that unconditional love will have the final word— 
and that only love can drive out hate. 
Only  by  drawing  on  the  lessons  of  our  past  can  we  ensure  the  flame 
of  justice  continues  to  shine.  By  standing  up  for  what  we  know  to  be 
right  and  speaking  uncomfortable  truths,  we  can  align  our  reality  closer 
with  the  ideal  enshrined  in  our  founding  documents  that  all  people  are 
created  equal.  In  remembering  Dr.  King,  we  also  remember  that  change 
has always relied on the willingness of our people to keep marching forward. 
If  we  do,  there  is  no  mountaintop  or  promised  land  we  cannot  reach. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  16,  2017, 
as  the  Martin  Luther  King,  Jr.,  Federal  Holiday.  I  encourage  all  Americans 
to  observe  this  day  with  appropriate  civic,  community,  and  service  projects 
in  honor  of  Dr.  King  and  to  visit  www.MLKDay.gov  to  find  Martin  Luther 
King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirteenth  day 
of  January,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Proclamation  9569  of  January  13,  2017 

Religious  Freedom  Day,  2017 

By  the  President  of  the  United  States  of  America 

A  Proclamation 
Believing that ‘‘Almighty God hath created the mind free,’’ Thomas Jefferson 
authored  the  Virginia  Statute  for  Religious  Freedom  after  our  young  Nation 
declared  its  independence.  This  idea  of  religious  liberty  later  became  a 
foundation for the First Amendment, which begins by stating that ‘‘Congress 
shall  make  no  law  respecting  an  establishment  of  religion,  or  prohibiting 
the  free  exercise  thereof  .  .  .’’  On  Religious  Freedom  Day,  we  rededicate 
ourselves to defending these fundamental principles, pay tribute to the many 
ways  women  and  men  of  different  religious  and  non-religious  backgrounds 
have  shaped  America’s  narrative,  and  resolve  to  continue  forging  a  future 
in  which  all  people  are  able  to  practice  their  faiths  freely  or  not  practice 
at all. 
Religious  freedom  is  a  principle  based  not  on  shared  ancestry,  culture, 
ethnicity,  or  faith  but  on  a  shared  commitment  to  liberty—and  it  lies  at 
the  very  heart  of  who  we  are  as  Americans.  As  a  Nation,  our  strength 
comes  from  our  diversity,  and  we  must  be  unified  in  our  commitment 
to protecting the freedoms of conscience and religious belief and the freedom 
to  live  our  lives  according  to  them.  Religious  freedom  safeguards  religion, 
allowing  us  to  flourish  as  one  of  the  most  religious  countries  on  Earth, 
but  it  also  strengthens  our  Nation  as  a  whole.  Brave  men  and  women 
of faith have challenged our conscience and brought us closer to our founding 
ideals,  from  the  abolition  of  slavery  to  the  expansion  of  civil  rights  and 
workers’ rights. And throughout our history, faith communities have helped 
uphold  these  values  by  joining  in  efforts  to  help  those  in  need—rallying 
in  the  face  of  tragedy  and  providing  care  or  shelter  in  times  of  disaster. 
As  they  built  this  country,  our  Founders  understood  that  religion  helps 
strengthen our Nation when it is not an extension of the State. And because 
our Government does not sponsor a religion—nor pressure anyone to practice 
a  particular  faith  or  any  faith  at  all—we  have  a  culture  that  aims  to  ensure 
people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely and proudly worship without 
fear  or  coercion.  Yet  in  2015,  nearly  20  percent  of  hate  crime  victims 
in  America  were  targeted  because  of  religious  bias.  That  is  unacceptable— 
and as Americans, we have an obligation to do better. 
If  we  are  to  defend  religious  freedom,  we  must  remember  that  when  any 
religious  group  is  targeted,  we  all  have  a  responsibility  to  speak  up.  At 
times  when  some  try  to  divide  us  along  religious  lines,  it  is  imperative 
that  we  recall  the  common  humanity  we  share—and  reject  a  politics  that 
seeks  to  manipulate,  prejudice,  or  bias,  and  that  targets  people  because 
of  religion.  Part  of  being  American  means  guarding  against  bigotry  and 
speaking  out  on  behalf  of  others,  no  matter  their  background  or  belief— 
whether they are wearing a hijab or a baseball cap, a yarmulke or a cowboy 
hat. 
Today,  we  must  also  remember  those  outside  the  United  States  who  are 
persecuted  for  their  faith  or  beliefs,  including  those  who  have  lost  their 
lives in attacks on sacred places. Religious liberty is more than a cornerstone 
of  American  life—it  is  a  universal  and  inalienable  right—and  as  members 
of  a  global  community,  we  must  strive  to  ensure  that  all  people  can  enjoy

that right in peace and security. That is why my Administration has worked 
with  coalitions  around  the  globe  to  end  discrimination  against  religious 
minorities,  protect  vulnerable  communities,  and  promote  religious  freedom 
for  all.  We  have  also  worked  to  ensure  that  those  who  are  persecuted 
for  their  religious  beliefs  can  find  safety  and  a  new  home  in  the  United 
States and elsewhere. 
America  has  changed  a  great  deal  since  Thomas  Jefferson  first  drafted  the 
Virginia  Statute  for  Religious  Freedom,  but  religious  liberty  is  a  right  we 
must  never  stop  striving  to  uphold.  Today,  let  us  work  to  protect  that 
precious  right  and  ensure  all  people  are  able  to  go  about  their  day  in 
safety and with dignity—without living in fear of violence or intimidation— 
in our time and for generations to come. 
NOW,  THEREFORE,  I,  BARACK  OBAMA,  President  of  the  United  States 
of  America,  by  virtue  of  the  authority  vested  in  me  by  the  Constitution 
and  the  laws  of  the  United  States,  do  hereby  proclaim  January  16,  2017, 
as  Religious  Freedom  Day.  I  call  on  all  Americans  to  commemorate  this 
day  with  events  and  activities  that  teach  us  about  this  critical  foundation 
of  our  Nation’s  liberty,  and  that  show  us  how  we  can  protect  it  for  future 
generations at home and around the world. 
IN  WITNESS  WHEREOF,  I  have  hereunto  set  my  hand  this  thirteenth  day 
of  January,  in  the  year  of  our  Lord  two  thousand  seventeen,  and  of  the 
Independence  of  the  United  States  of  America  the  two  hundred  and  forty- 
first.

Presidential Documents

Notice  of  January  13,  2017 

Continuation  of  the  National  Emergency  With  Respect  to 
Ukraine 

On March 6, 2014, by Executive Order 13660, I declared a national emergency 
pursuant  to  the  International  Emergency  Economic  Powers  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1701–1706) to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national 
security  and  foreign  policy  of  the  United  States  constituted  by  the  actions 
and policies of persons that undermine democratic processes and institutions 
in  Ukraine;  threaten  its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial 
integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On  March  16,  2014,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13661,  which  expanded  the 
scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13660,  and 
found that the actions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federa-
tion with respect to Ukraine undermine democratic processes and institutions 
in  Ukraine;  threaten  its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial 
integrity; and contribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On March 20, 2014, I issued Executive Order 13662, which further expanded 
the  scope  of  the  national  emergency  declared  in  Executive  Order  13660, 
as  expanded  in  scope  in  Executive  Order  13661,  and  found  that  the  actions 
and  policies  of  the  Government  of  the  Russian  Federation,  including  its 
purported  annexation  of  Crimea  and  its  use  of  force  in  Ukraine,  continue 
to  undermine  democratic  processes  and  institutions  in  Ukraine;  threaten 
its  peace,  security,  stability,  sovereignty,  and  territorial  integrity;  and  con-
tribute to the misappropriation of its assets. 
On  December  19,  2014,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13685,  to  take  additional 
steps  to  address  the  Russian  occupation  of  the  Crimea  region  of  Ukraine. 
The  actions  and  policies  addressed  in  these  Executive  Orders  continue  to 
pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign 
policy of the United States. For this reason, the national emergency declared 
on  March  6,  2014,  and  the  measures  adopted  on  that  date,  on  March  16, 
2014,  on  March  20,  2014,  and  on  December  19,  2014,  to  deal  with  that 
emergency,  must  continue  in  effect  beyond  March  6,  2017.  Therefore,  in 
accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50  U.S.C. 
1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared  in 
Executive Order 13660.

On  March  8,  2015,  I  issued  Executive  Order  13692,  declaring  a  national 
emergency with respect to the situation in Venezuela, including the Govern-
ment  of  Venezuela’s  erosion  of  human  rights  guarantees,  persecution  of

as the exacerbating presence of significant government corruption. Therefore, 
in  accordance  with  section  202(d)  of  the  National  Emergencies  Act  (50 
U.S.C.  1622(d)),  I  am  continuing  for  1  year  the  national  emergency  declared

laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct the following:

ating  and  Expanding  Ladders  of  Opportunity  for  Boys  and  Young  Men
